{"name":"Internet Computer","id":"internet-computer_base","symbol":"icp","description":"The Internet Computer is a decentralized cloud blockchain designed to run applications, websites, and backend systems fully on-chain. Its architecture provides robust security, resilience, and built-in multi-chain support. A key focus of the network is enabling a “self-writing cloud,” where AI tools allow users generate applications through natural-language instructions. Developers and users can experiment with the platform using AI app-generation tools like caffeine.ai or by writing serverless code directly through online IDEs such as icp.ninja. The ICP token is used to pay for computation (through a burn-based model) and to participate in network governance through staking.","links":"https://internetcomputer.org/","market_cap":1786222305,"market_cap_rank":60,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/internet-computer/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"0x00f3c42833c3170159af4e92dbb451fb3f708917","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x00f3c42833c3170159af4e92dbb451fb3f708917"}},"is_native":false}
