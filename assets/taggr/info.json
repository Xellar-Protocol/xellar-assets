{"name":"TAGGR","id":"taggr","symbol":"taggr","description":"TAGGR is a public good, a mix of forums & blogs, where users write posts, upload pics, engage with others, or just use it as their blog. The differentiators: - Content is immutable to others (only the content creator can modify or delete) - Users govern all code changes via voting - 100% autonomous. It generates revenues from user activity and uses part of these funds to auto-top up with cycles. As it is now without any upgrade or devs it can run as long as IC runs and there is user activity","links":"https://taggr.network/","market_cap":1127763,"market_cap_rank":3860,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/taggr/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
