{"name":"CrossCurve Bridged ETH (Fantom)","id":"crosscurve-bridged-eth-fantom","symbol":"xweth","description":"CrossCurve is a cross-chain trading and yield protocol built on Curve, creating a unified cross-chain liquidity market by aggregating existing Curve pools. Fragmented liquidity is costly and inefficient across multiple blockchains. Transferring large amounts is inefficient, slow, inconvenient, and unsafe due to bridge hacks. Liquidity moves between blockchains for higher yields, leading to competition for liquidity incentives.","links":"https://app.crosscurve.fi/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/crosscurve-bridged-eth-fantom/logo.png","detail_platform":{"fantom":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x3c2fcf53f742345c5c1b3dcb2612a1949bc1f18d"}}}
