{"name":"Microtick","id":"microtick","symbol":"tick","description":"The Microtick project is a new mechanism for decentralized price discovery and trading. Its vision is to create a trading system more suited for blockchain usage where blocks come at discrete, relatively infrequent and sometimes unpredictable times, and then build upon that vision to create a new trading paradigm that not only works better on, but promotes decentralized trading over the legacy centralized paradigm.","links":"https://www.microtick.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/microtick/logo.png"}
