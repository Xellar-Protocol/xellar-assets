{"name":"Bill","id":"bill-token","symbol":"bill","description":"BILL is a token built on the Ethereum Blockchain and is used to gain access to NoRug.com. NoRug is an exclusive launchpad that gives BILL holders access to safe and unruggable meme coins. The only way to access the NoRug Platform is to hold BILL in your wallet. The more BILLS you hold, the more access you have based on a Tiered System. Bill Token (BILL) launched on August 5th 2021. There are only 1,000,000,000 BILLs in circulation and no more can be created. We felt that offering a low amount of capped tokens would enable a ‘store of value’ offering, which compliments BILLs use as a currency to access NoRug.com. Bill Token was first deployed on the Ethereum main-net on August 5th 2021 and has since also become available on the Binance Smart chain.","links":"https://www.billtoken.org/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bill-token/logo.png"}
