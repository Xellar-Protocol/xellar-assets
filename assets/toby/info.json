{"name":"toby","id":"toby","symbol":"toby","description":"Toby on Solana (TOBY) is a meme coin that emerged from the Solana blockchain as a community-driven token. Originally created as a lighthearted experiment, the project took a new direction when the original developer left, leaving the community to take charge. Since then, TOBY has evolved into a unique, community-led project centered around holding and spreading positivity within the cryptocurrency space. The TOBY community consists of dedicated supporters, including larger holders known as \"TURBO WHALES\" and \"diamond hands,\" who are committed to maintaining TOBY’s value and supporting each other in a collective mission. While there are no staking or rewards mechanisms, the community has focused on cultivating a “good vibes economy,” with members actively contributing to a positive and humorous atmosphere. TOBY’s journey is one of organic growth, driven by a unified group of supporters who believe in the token's potential as a fun and community-oriented asset in the Solana ecosystem.","links":"https://tobyonsol.io","market_cap":7697.55,"market_cap_rank":7771,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/toby/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"Gx8jR2sT6mJCgxcLV3DAXpVKLtf3dHiQfHqwhrhtpump"}}}
