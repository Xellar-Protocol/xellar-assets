{"name":"CeloStarter","id":"celostarter","symbol":"cstar","description":"CeloStarter is a decentralized fundraising community, incubator, and launchpad designed exclusively for the CELO ecosystem. Innovators can submit their projects to CeloStarter, which will be passed by the community and get seed-funded. Our launchpad provides a robust platform for IDOs to take place, with a tiered based allocation mechanism. More than 260 projects applied to the CELO Camp Batch 3, but only 22 finalists were selected to participate and pitch their projects to the VCs. However, many other projects that did not make it to the finals were also great and outstanding. We felt all those projects need another place from where they can their support and funds which will be used for their development - that was led to the birth of this idea, CeloStarter. Our community members are committed to provide full support including marketing and PR before, during and after the project launches.","links":"https://celostarter.net/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/celostarter/logo.png"}
