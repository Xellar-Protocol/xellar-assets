{"name":"Vitall Markets","id":"vitall-markets","symbol":"vital","description":"Vitall Markets is a token-backed NFT development project that aims to build an audio NFT marketplace where independent artist, musicians, and creators can have full ownership over their audio samples. The NFTs, called Keykards, will be minted in 3 phases with each phase containing 333 Keykards. They will provide the future funding of the project while also granting keykard holders rewards. These rewards include beta access to the NFT marketplace, voting rights, and exclusive giveaways. If you own at least one Keykard NFT from all 3 phases, you will be given a quarterly dividend paid in SOL. Apart from the Keykard NFTs, Vitall Markets have launched a token called VITAL. Using VITAL, users will be able to buy music and audio samples for a 2% fee. If the buyer uses SOL, the fee will be 9%.
