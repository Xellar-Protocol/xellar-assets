Liberty Finance DEX is the first decentralized exchange with full CEX trading features and an optional completely Islamic-compliant section. What makes your project unique? First DEX that will offer full CEX features, including Leverage, proprietary FIAT On/Off Ramps and a user-friendly UI and a CEX-like user experience which will cater to the less technical users. History of your project. Custody should not be centralized! Liberty finance has been born out of the need to have an equitable, transparent and easy to use DEX, which brings all the benefits of security and custody from a DEX, together with the user-friendly and complex features of a CEX. Currently Testnet is available, as well as an Airdrop. Whatâ€™s next for your project? Finish funding rounds, bring out mainnet and launch full scale. What can your token be used for? Governance, fee reduction, staking, real yield.","links":"https://www.libfi.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/libfi/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
