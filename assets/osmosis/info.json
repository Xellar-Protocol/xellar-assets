{"name":"Osmosis","id":"osmosis","symbol":"osmo","description":"Osmosis (OSMO) is the premier DEX and cross-chain DeFi hub within the Cosmos ecosystem, a network of over 50 sovereign, interoperable blockchains seamlessly connected through the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC). Pioneering in its approach, Osmosis offers a dynamic trading and liquidity provision experience, integrating non-IBC assets from other ecosystems, including Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and Polkadot. Initially adopting Balancer-style pools, Osmosis now also features a concentrated liquidity model that is orders of magnitude more capital efficient, meaning that significantly less liquidity is required to handle the same amount of trading volume with minimal slippage.","links":"https://osmosis.zone/","market_cap":127441413,"market_cap_rank":443,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/osmosis/logo.png","detail_platform":{"osmosis":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"uosmo"},"evmos":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0xfa3c22c069b9556a4b2f7ece1ee3b467909f4864","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/evmos/tokens/0xfa3c22c069b9556a4b2f7ece1ee3b467909f4864"},"cosmos":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"ibc/14F9BC3E44B8A9C1BE1FB08980FAB87034C9905EF17CF2F5008FC085218811CC"},"secret":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"secret150jec8mc2hzyyqak4umv6cfevelr0x9p0mjxgg"}}}
