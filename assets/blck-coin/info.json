{"name":"BLCK Coin","id":"blck-coin","symbol":"blck","description":"Black culture has globally influenced art, music, fashion, and sports—but our communities haven't seen a fair share of the resulting wealth. BLCKcoin changes this by directly funding Black-owned businesses, education, and homeownership—no corporations, no governments, just us empowering ourselves. Yes—we fundamentally believe we are fully interconnected as a human species. If one group benefits, we all benefit. The more people who buy, the larger our community fund grows, creating a larger impact for everyone. Along with deflationary and staking mechanisms, everyone has the potential to gain wealth as long as you HODL!","links":"https://blckcoin.org/","market_cap":218157,"market_cap_rank":5578,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/blck-coin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf5de8697232a16a942f7cf706415f553ce53e27f","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xf5de8697232a16a942f7cf706415f553ce53e27f"}}}
