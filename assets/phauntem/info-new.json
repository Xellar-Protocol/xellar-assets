{"name":"Phauntem","id":"phauntem","symbol":"phauntem","description":"Introducing Phauntem, the groundbreaking token that has emerged as the cornerstone of the Solana ecosystem. Born out of a vision to redefine the landscape of decentralized finance, Phauntem stands as a testament to community-driven innovation and resilience. The journey of Phauntem began with its original developer, who selflessly launched the token and divested their holdings at a mere $800 market cap, demonstrating unwavering commitment to the project's ideals. However, rather than falter, the community rallied behind Phauntem, recognizing its potential to become the flagship token of the Phantom wallet. Driven by a shared mission to propel Phauntem to the forefront of the crypto space, the community has harnessed its collective strength to foster growth and development. With a steadfast dedication to transparency, inclusivity, and decentralization, Phauntem embodies the ethos of the blockchain revolution. As the new face of Phantom wallet, Phauntem represents not only a token, but a symbol of empowerment and possibility. With every transaction, Phauntem paves the way for a future where financial sovereignty is a reality for all.","links":"https://phauntem.org/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/phauntem/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"5veVHPNDsmSxDW4Abpb368wLHpo32LP3fqhfJHnkSSwo"}}}
