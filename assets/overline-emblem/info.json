{"name":"Overline Emblem","id":"overline-emblem","symbol":"emb","description":"Overline (https://overline.network) is a blockchain protocol that enables applications built for truly decentralized finance (DeFi), including Overline’s custom, peer-to-peer exchange platform the Interchange. Overline core technology connects disparate blockchains, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, into a unified “multichain”, capable of interoperability and cross-chain communication, all powered by a mineable network and not centralized validators, APIs, or oracles. With no accounts, no wrapped tokens, no personal data, and no exchange/liquidity fees, the Interchange (https://interchange.overline.network) is a first of its kind platform that allows anyone, anywhere to trade wherever and whenever they want.","links":"https://overline.network/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/overline-emblem/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"0xdb0acc14396d108b3c5574483acb817855c9dc8d"}}}
