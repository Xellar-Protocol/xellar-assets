{"name":"UpOnly","id":"uponly-token","symbol":"upo","description":"UpOnly – A Premier Play-to-Earn Data and Prediction Platform. UpOnly is building the industry’s first play-to-earn data directory. The platform will compile comprehensive data on play-to-earn games and establish itself as the go-to-resource for blockchain gamers, similar to what CoinMarketCap and Coingecko accomplished for the broader crypto economy. The UpOnly data directory will be underpinned by a centralized database architecture and will utilize query solutions such as TheGraph to retrieve real-time data from listed blockchain games. UpOnly will present insightful and actionable data on all existing play-to-earn gaming platforms. Users will be able to view data such as number of gamers, trading volume for in-game assets, upcoming events, prize sizes, odds of winning prize pools, ease-of-entry, etc. Players can use the wealth of information available on UpOnly to identify which games offer the most lucrative rewards and the best gameplay experiences. In addition to its unique data directory for blockchain games, UpOnly is developing a decentralized infrastructure that will allow spectators to bet on the outcome of play-to-earn games. Instead of simply watching games, spectators can use actionable data from UpOnly to predict the outcome of games and earn financial rewards.","links":"https://uponly.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/uponly-token/logo.png"}
