{"name":"Apraemio","id":"apraemio","symbol":"apra","description":"Apraemio is a new RWA web3 project which is looking to advance the asset backed tokens. Having secured a 30 year partnership with a gold mine in Mali, Apraemio has created a token which is backed by 50% of the output from the mine. The token itself is a utility token which allows holders access to make real world purchases across Europe including property, cars, and more. Apraemio looks to provide the crypto space with a hedge against crypto market volatility, for token holders to diversify their portfolios with physical gold reserves.","links":"https://www.apraemio.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/apraemio/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0c4ac8952c28e2e7fe22033c8d2f1263372d301d","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x0c4ac8952c28e2e7fe22033c8d2f1263372d301d"}}}
