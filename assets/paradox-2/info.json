{"name":"Paradox","id":"paradox-2","symbol":"pdx","description":"A collection of 10,000 semi-fungible tokens. Taking the Experimental standard to next level. Paradox powered by ERC-20, ERC-1155, ERC-721. Paradox is the most secure & efficient iteration of the 404 standard. Paradox ( $PDX) is the most efficient, secure and scalable iteration of 404. Pandora paved the way; now it's our turn to build on it. $PDX is here to build on upon what's been done and solve major existing issues. $PDX gas costs are reduced more than 50% compared to those of other hybrids. (ERC-X, DN404, and ERC-404) In ERC425, instead of adding a patch to this exploit, we fixed this once and for all by branching the transfer function for ERC1155 NFTs and associated ERC20 tokens. Making ERC425 as robust as published ERC token standards.","links":"https://pdx.build/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/paradox-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8b8aa7777e18408c07b0ed52ca3dd5bdab34eb7e"}}}
