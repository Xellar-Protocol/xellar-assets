{"name":"The Ennead","id":"the-ennead","symbol":"neadram","description":"The Ennead is an optimization layer built upon ve(3,3) protocols. We aim to pool our collective resources to bolster the ecosystems, and to provide a seamless integration for all users. The Ennead is able to provide true Real-Yield without relying on an emissions model artificially pumping the returns. This is done through optimizing existing infrastructure, such as the veRAM fee/bribing model, along with providing boosting support. Returns are passed down to neadRAM stakers, giving natural yield from fee revenue on a service-- which is by definition \"real-yield\" as there are no artificial returns. -The Ennead allows ve(3,3) LP depositors and veNFT holders to maximize their returns.","links":"https://beta.ennead.farm","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/the-ennead/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x40301951af3f80b8c1744ca77e55111dd3c1dba1"}}}
