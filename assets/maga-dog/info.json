{"name":"MAGA DOG","id":"maga-dog","symbol":"atlas","description":"The project centers on promoting Atlas, the dog, as a symbolic figure and potential \"First Dog\" if JD Vance were to become Vice President alongside Donald Trump. Atlas has gained popularity by appearing with Trump and Vance on the campaign trail, and his visibility and timing (with his birthday coinciding with Election Day) position him as a potential symbol of patriotism, loyalty, and character. The aim seems to be building buzz around Atlas as an emblematic figure, highlighting his role as a loyal companion and connecting his story with the campaign's values and aspirations. The project would use Atlas's image and moments from his appearances to capture public interest, creating a mix of personal warmth and national pride that could resonate with voters and followers of the campaign.","links":"https://magadogatlas.com","market_cap":15118.97,"market_cap_rank":7234,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/maga-dog/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"D4n99BqHGvdL3ExyvdETV6Y4rWXkf2WwRxhaV1Epump"}}}
