{"name":"$ROACH","id":"roach_solana","symbol":"$roach","description":"$ROACH is an antifragile meme token designed to thrive in chaos and volatility. Inspired by the unstoppable resilience of the cockroach, it runs on a flat 7% tax and a unique 5-tier pressure-response system. As market pressure increases, so do the rewards for holders - punishing panic sellers and incentivizing diamond hands. Whether it’s FUD, rugs, or total market collapse, $ROACH is built to survive and grow stronger. Just hold to earn. When other tokens die, $ROACH scurries on. It’s not just resistant, it’s antifragile by design.","links":"https://roach.army","market_cap":549.42,"market_cap_rank":13138,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/roach_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"H78X8fzErUhmr9XoBymqGnWU67rkReP1mvxHrA1vLxfN","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/H78X8fzErUhmr9XoBymqGnWU67rkReP1mvxHrA1vLxfN"}},"is_native":false}
