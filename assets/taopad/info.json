{"name":"TaoPad","id":"taopad","symbol":"tpad","description":"Taopad is a cryptocurrency protocol designed to synergize with the BitTensor network's native token, $TAO. It introduces a novel rewards mechanism, leveraging a collection of miners and validator nodes to reward its holders with $wTAO (Wrapped TAO) tokens. Taopad allows users to enjoy the benefits of mined $TAO without having to invest effort in the cumbersome task of procuring and managing BitTensor network mining and validator equipment TAOPAD is intricately linked with $TAO and the BitTensor network. As a gateway into the Bittensor network from Ethereum, TaoPad enables holders of $TPAD, its token, to gain exposure to value on the Bittensor network by acting as a catalyst facilitating competitive mining and validation activities on the the Bittensor network and distributing rewards gained to holders of $TPAD.","links":"https://www.taopad.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/taopad/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x5483dc6abda5f094865120b2d251b5744fc2ecb5"}}}
