{"name":"Wrapped NXM","id":"wrapped-nxm_ethereum","symbol":"wnxm","description":"NXM token itself is created solely for internal use within the Nexus Mutual protocol and all of its holders must go through KYC. As such, a wrapped version is created to allow more users to own the token without having to do KYC. In the meantime it also improves its liquidity outside the protocol’s bonding curve by being listed on exchanges such as Uniswap and Binance. To make use of the wNXM token, it first needs to be unwrapped into NXM by a registered member of Nexus Mutual. After it is unwrapped, wNXM becomes NXM and can be used as a normal token on the Nexus Mutual platform.","links":"https://nexusmutual.io/","market_cap":34851356,"market_cap_rank":808,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wrapped-nxm/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0d438f3b5175bebc262bf23753c1e53d03432bde","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x0d438f3b5175bebc262bf23753c1e53d03432bde"}},"is_native":false}
