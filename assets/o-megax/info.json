{"name":"O-megax","id":"o-megax","symbol":"o-megax","description":"What is the $OMEGAX Project? $OMEGAX is a decentralized, AI-powered health insurance system built on blockchain. It eliminates traditional insurance companies and puts control directly in the hands of the community through a DAO model. How It Works: No middlemen: Patients, hospitals, and providers manage everything together. AI-powered claims processing: No delays, no paperwork—instant verification and payouts. Data privacy first: Medical records stay off-chain; only proof (hashes) is stored on-chain. Community-owned: Members vote on premiums, coverage, and claim verification. Staking mechanism: Hospitals and providers stake tokens to participate in the system. Why It’s Different? First-of-its-kind on BNB Chain Doxxed team & registered company under @dmcccrypto (a global Web3 hub) Previously hit $11M MC on Solana and is now expanding to BNB Chain Strategic partnerships, CEX listings, and strong market presence $OMEGAX is not just another meme coin—it’s a real utility project bringing AI-driven insurance to Web3.","links":"https://www.omegax.health/","market_cap":89339,"market_cap_rank":6797,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/o-megax/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6fd2854cd1b05b8eb5f6d25c714184a92fedaf4f","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x6fd2854cd1b05b8eb5f6d25c714184a92fedaf4f"}}}
