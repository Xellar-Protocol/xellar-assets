{"name":"pipi the cat","id":"pipi-the-cat","symbol":"pipi","description":"Pipi, Pepe's Cat is a community-driven meme coin on the Solana blockchain. It was created as a fun tokenized asset for fans of meme culture and crypto to collectively support. The PIPI token has no core utility beyond being a digital collectible and store of value for holders in the community. Its value is derived purely from viral marketing efforts and community-building activities. The goal is to build an engaged group of Pipi supporters who find entertainment and connection through holding and trading PIPI, participating in community channels, collecting branded NFTs, and attending real-world events. Pipi aims to embody the lighthearted and humorous spirit of meme culture. It does not have any technological innovations or complex features. The focus is on organic community growth, creative marketing, fostering a welcoming environment, and collaborating with members to shape the direction of the project.","links":"https://pipithecat.com","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pipi-the-cat/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"BZKuDqzD4rb2puUV2cbSNd2kZzJ5JzKiQKwBzCk8hrLu","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/BZKuDqzD4rb2puUV2cbSNd2kZzJ5JzKiQKwBzCk8hrLu"}}}
