{"name":"Prediqt","id":"prediqt-2","symbol":"prqt","description":"Predigt is a dynamic toolkit built on Abstract Chain that helps users accumulate Abstract XP while staying profitable. Unlike many projects that lock into one utility, Predigt adapts continuously to market shifts by rolling out tools that provide competitive advantages. Originally private creations of Chris XC, a multi-chain developer, these utilities are now being made publicly accessible. By doing so, Predigt not only broadens user access but also strengthens the Abstract ecosystem with community-driven tools like the PnL Bot and Discord Verification Bot. The goal is to expand beyond individual use cases, supporting a growing ecosystem that thrives on adaptability and collaborative innovation.","links":"https://prediqt.xyz/","market_cap":518854,"market_cap_rank":5073,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/prediqt-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"abstract":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xfe6371682f58b610e7a2da97a0df2cfd45d60cf1","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/abstract/tokens/0xfe6371682f58b610e7a2da97a0df2cfd45d60cf1"}}}
