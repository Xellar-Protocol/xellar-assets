{"name":"Many Worlds","id":"many-worlds","symbol":"many","description":"Many Worlds Token ($MANY) was launched on 12/22/2021 and developed by an international team consisting of multi-industry specialists. $MANY is the worlds first cryptocurrency asset with a dynamic tokenomics system which allows the smart contract to interact differently with each individual wallet based on pre-set variables. Holders of $MANY will find that their tokens are able to \"level up\" based on how long they are held, and with each level, their tokens acquire new abilities. Holders will get BUSD rewards airdropped to their wallets every week after 7 days of holding. After holding the token in a wallet for more than 90 days, the airdrops become even bigger! While the rewards are great, the token was designed to power future applications that are currently in development. These include, but are not limited to, an NFT Trading Post, NFT customization platform, blockchain asset injection technology, and more.","links":"https://www.manyworldstoken.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/many-worlds/logo.png"}
