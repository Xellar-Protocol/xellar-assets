{"name":"upsidedowncat","id":"upsidedowncat-2_solana","symbol":"usdcat","description":"\"Upsidedowncat\", an internet meme sensation from January 2021, features video of a cat delightfully hanging upside-down off a sofa. USDCAT token captures the whimsical spirit of the \"upsidedowncat\". Just like a de-pegged stablecoin, \"upsidedowncat\" remains upside-down until USDCAT repegs to 1 USD. Abandoned by the original team, USDCAT is a community-driven meme on Solana. There are no team tokens, 100% of the supply is circulating, no taxes or funny shenanigans like that. USDCAT is meme coin with no inherent value or financial expectations, and it is intended solely for entertainment.","links":"https://www.upsidedowncat.xyz/","market_cap":29804,"market_cap_rank":9038,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/upsidedowncat-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"F23fFqpRNsmWjuUrFpfM1pvoVvMSpLuN6hY978Y1JXLt","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/F23fFqpRNsmWjuUrFpfM1pvoVvMSpLuN6hY978Y1JXLt"}},"is_native":false}
