{"name":"Reverse","id":"reverse","symbol":"rvrs","description":"Reverse is making saving the planet simple. Buy, use or sell our token and you’re creating a positive impact in the fight against climate change. Designed to offer you a way to have a positive impact on the environment without permanent cost. We do this through a token allocation tax on transactions. Reverse token uses reflection to transform a percentage of the transaction into funding eco initiatives. We offer grants and micro grants to local community projects, aiming to bring environmental awareness to as many people as possible. We believe that this will lead to a knock on effect in corresponding communities, which too can request funds to improve their local ecology. Do good, get rewarded. As long as you’re holding RVRS You’ll receive additional tokens from reflection - no need to stake! These tokens turn RVRS token into an interest generating asset.","links":"https://reverseclimatechange.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/reverse/logo.png"}
