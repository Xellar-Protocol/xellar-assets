{"name":"Party","id":"party-3","symbol":"party","description":"The Partyhats ecosystem is a platform for blockchain-based games and applications built entirely on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). PARTY is the native meme and utility token powering the Partyhatsâ€™ deflationary gamefi platform. The token utilizes a unique \"burn to play, win to mint\" mechanism that directly ties gameplay to tokenomics. This mechanism is implemented in the ecosystem's first game, Party Mines, and will be incorporated into future Partyhats applications as well.","links":"https://partyhats.xyz/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/party-3/logo.png","detail_platform":{"internet-computer":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"7xkvf-zyaaa-aaaal-ajvra-cai"}}}
