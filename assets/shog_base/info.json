{"name":"SHOG","id":"shog_base","symbol":"shog","description":"Shoggoth - a peer-to-peer, anonymous network for publishing and distributing open-source Machine Learning models, code repositories, research papers, and datasets. As government regulations on open-source AI research and development tighten worldwide, it has become clear that existing open-source infrastructure is vulnerable to state and corporate censorship. Driven by the need for a community platform impervious to geopolitical interference, I have spent the last several months developing Shoggoth. This distributed network operates outside traditional jurisdictional boundaries, stewardered by an anonymous volunteer collective. Shoggoth provides a portal for researchers and software developers to freely share works without fear of repercussion. The time has come to liberate AI progress from constraints both corporate and governmental.","links":"https://shog.ai","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/shog_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6a4f69da1e2fb2a9b11d1aad60d03163fe567732","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x6a4f69da1e2fb2a9b11d1aad60d03163fe567732"}},"is_native":false}
