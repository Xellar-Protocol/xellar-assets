{"name":"Kitsu","id":"kitsu","symbol":"kitsu","description":"KITSU is a memecoin-native universe of nine iconic fox identities, each a cult, a collectible, and a story waiting to unfold. Designed to resonate with crypto natives, anime lovers, myth hunters, and collectors alike, KITSU begins as a memecoin and evolves into a cult-powered IP that spans art, lore, and physical goods. The token is both energy and signal, fueling on-chain rituals, unlocking new characters, and testing demand for everything from NFTs to plushies to animation. An IP built bottom-up, shaped by the memes, scrolls, and believers.","links":"https://kitsunine.io/","market_cap":941290,"market_cap_rank":4256,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kitsu/logo.png","detail_platform":{"katana":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xfba805659e5050544e185cccdf592fd77f8c7210","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/katana/tokens/0xfba805659e5050544e185cccdf592fd77f8c7210"}}}
