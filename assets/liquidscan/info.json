{"name":"LiquidScan","id":"liquidscan","symbol":"lqscan","description":"LiquidScan is the first quality-focused portfolio & launch tracker purpose-built for HyperEVM and the wider Hyperliquid ecosystem. Through a lightning-fast web dashboard and a lightweight Telegram bot, it lets you follow token creators and wallets in real time, surfaces a proprietary confidence score for every deployer, and labels wallets as builder, farmer or sniper. Drill into full buy/sell history straight from LiquidLaunch, inspect live holdings, realized P&L, ROI and win-rate, filter new listings by audited code, liquidity lock and age, and set instant alerts for whale moves, rugs or trend-breaking volume spikes. Smart-contract events are indexed every two seconds, so you always see current price, liquidity, FDV and volume the moment a pair is minted. Whether you’re hunting alpha or protecting capital, LiquidScan condenses the on-chain stats that matter into a single click.","links":"https://liquidscan.fun/","market_cap":551143,"market_cap_rank":4387,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/liquidscan/logo.png","detail_platform":{"hyperevm":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0xcb0ac0aa94c67dde8688ac34c8e4d6c18e78b638","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/hyperevm/tokens/0xcb0ac0aa94c67dde8688ac34c8e4d6c18e78b638"}}}
