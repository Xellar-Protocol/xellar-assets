{"name":"Usual ETH","id":"eth0_ethereum","symbol":"eth0","description":"ETH0 is a synthetic ETH asset fully backed by Lido’s wstETH and issued by the Usual protocol. It allows institutional investors and crypto-native whales to maintain directional ETH exposure while capturing significantly higher yields than conventional staking or restaking. Powered by the same architecture that underpins Usual’s stablecoin (backed by tokenized T-bills), ETH0 holders receive USUAL tokens, allowing them to outperform the underlying yield. For hedge funds, treasuries, and whales seeking to make ETH work harder, ETH0 offers a liquid, composable, and yield-optimized vehicle.","links":"https://usual.money/","market_cap":11577531,"market_cap_rank":1455,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/eth0/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x734eec7930bc84ec5732022b9eb949a81fb89abe","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x734eec7930bc84ec5732022b9eb949a81fb89abe"}},"is_native":false}
