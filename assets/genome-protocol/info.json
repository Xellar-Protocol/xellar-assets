{"name":"Genome Protocol","id":"genome-protocol","symbol":"nome","description":"Web3 is growing rapidly, but it lacks the infrastructure to understand, grow, and retain new and existing users. Many studios face the challenge of turning attention into meaningful, measureable, and retainable growth. Genome solves these problems by turning engagement into programmable, lasting value. Our approach adapts to user behavior in real time, rewarding high value actions and creating persistent value flows between platforms and people. We're creating the foundation for InfoFi, an intelligent, scalable infrastructure in a single programmable layer that captures, scores, and rewards real user behavior across any platform. This foundation powers persistent, engagement across all chains, apps, games, protocols, and campaigns. It transforms how you attract and retain users, and measure value.","links":"https://genomeprotocol.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/genome-protocol/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
