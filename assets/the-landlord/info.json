{"name":"The Landlord","id":"the-landlord","symbol":"lndlrd","description":"The Landlord is a crypto project that focuses on the creation and selling of craft beers and ales. Users are able to buy drinks from the online store with fiat and cryptocurrencies. Of course, the holders of the $LNDLRD tokens get maximum benefits while using the Landlord’s mobile application and purchasing in-store. Also, the team aims to provide a go-to place for all pub merchandise and products. In that way, the project provides additional revenue which will be used to buy back and burn Landlord’s coins, reducing the total supply. Besides the management want to provide an outlet to sell the ale and craft beer. LNDLRD is a BEP20 (BSC) token with a 6% tax rate. So, the token’s protocol deducts six percent from each transaction. As a result, 3% goes to marketing to drive the ecosystem. It includes the Landlord app, Landlord pubs, Landlord craft beer, etc. Also, 2% goes to the liquidity pool on Pancake. The rest 1% goes to the existing token-holders. Therefore, the more $LNDLRD a person holds, the bigger his passive income. Also, the developers plan to make annual burning parties to decrease coin circulation supply.","links":"https://www.thelandlord.biz/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/the-landlord/logo.png"}
