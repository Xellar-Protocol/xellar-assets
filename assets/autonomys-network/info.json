{"name":"Autonomys Network","id":"autonomys-network","symbol":"ai3","description":"The Autonomys Network — the foundation layer for AI3.0 — is a dedicated Layer-1 blockchain that utilizes a novel storage-based consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Archival-Storage (PoAS) and encompasses high-throughput permanent distributed storage, data availability and access, and modular execution. The Autonomys' protocol is optimized to support high-throughput, low-latency decentralized applications, including those in AI, agentic systems, and modular computation. By providing a permanent, trustless data availability layer at the consensus level, it enables new classes of decentralized applications that require continuous, immutable, and scalable access to historical data.","links":"https://www.autonomys.xyz/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/autonomys-network/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
