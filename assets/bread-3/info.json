{"name":"Bread","id":"bread-3","symbol":"bread","description":"Breadchain Cooperative is a venture studio building post-capitalist alternative economic mechanisms using crypto infrastructure. We aim to do this by building and utilizing what we call *solidarity primitives* - development tools which help to forge solidarity between individuals and collectives. BREAD is the community currency for the Breadchain ecosystem which exists on Gnosis Chain. All BREAD is created through the Bread Crowdstaking Application which anyone with xDAI on Gnosis Chain is able to use to have some BREAD for themselves. The Crowdstaking Application is a smart contract on Gnosis Chain that accepts a user’s xDAI and turns it into sDAI. In exchange, stakers receive BREAD tokens, minted at a 1-to-1 ratio with the collateralized xDAI. All of the interest earned on the sDAI is helps fund the collective and its various member projects based on a monthly vote from BREAD holders. The Crowdstaking Application functions as a fundraising engine for the Breadchain Cooperative, while the BREAD token acts as a local currency within the ecosystem, promoting financial sustainability. Additionally, BREAD holders are able to to vote on how the yield generated from the sDAI is distributed among the projects part of the Breadchain Network every month. At the moment this includes the Crypto Commons Association, ReFi DAO, Citizen Wallet, Labor DAO, and Symbiota Coop in addition to the Breadchain core devs and shared Breadchain treasury.","links":"https://breadchain.xyz/","market_cap":441531,"market_cap_rank":5294,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bread-3/logo.png","detail_platform":{"xdai":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa555d5344f6fb6c65da19e403cb4c1ec4a1a5ee3","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/xdai/tokens/0xa555d5344f6fb6c65da19e403cb4c1ec4a1a5ee3"}}}
