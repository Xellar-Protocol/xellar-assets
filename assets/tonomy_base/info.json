{"name":"Tonomy","id":"tonomy_base","symbol":"tono","description":"Tonomy is building a self-sovereign digital identity and AI ecosystem. At the heart is Tonomy ID, an autonomous ID vault that gives individuals full control over their data, secured in cold storage on their mobile devices and never stored in centralized databases. Core features: - Data Sovereignty – Individuals own and manage their identity, with zero-knowledge architecture ensuring no central storage or exposure. - Reusable KYC – Once verified, identities can be reused instantly across platforms, eliminating repetitive onboarding and reducing fraud. - Sovereign AI Agents – Personalized AI agents operate directly from the user’s ID vault, processing data locally to automate online interactions, enhance efficiency, and ensure privacy. - Universal Access – One login across Web2, Web3, and decentralized applications, including DAOs, DeFi, and social networks. This creates a global, trustless ecosystem where identity, authentication, and AI-driven automation work together securely and seamlessly.","links":"https://tonomy.io","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/tonomy_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x36a0e9d5bb7322b26185d76fb3fce46a40007e90","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x36a0e9d5bb7322b26185d76fb3fce46a40007e90"}},"is_native":false}
