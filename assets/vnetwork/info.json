{"name":"VNetwork","id":"vnetwork","symbol":"vnw","description":"VNetwork is a decentralized project, aimed to be the fundaments and core build of the Vanity Ecosystem. Under development since October 2022 by the same team behind Vanity, project since 2021 and company established in September 2022, VNetwork is a Decentralised Finance Tool aimed at being competitive with low usage fees, which will be revisited in the first update to implement purely $VNW (VNetwork Token), while reducing the fees and implementing a new interaction method for presales creators and investors. VNetwork introduces the Shared Treasury, a wallet ideated for the ecosystem used for development, marketing, buybacks and business expenses for VNetwork and Vanity. At VNetwork we focus on building what the public needs and we feel that DeFi tools are either outdated, overpriced, or both.","links":"https://www.vnetwork.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/vnetwork/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xfa7d4d3fde48e7d70840b6947c4065f8fcfe796d"}}}
