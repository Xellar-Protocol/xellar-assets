{"name":"GameGuru","id":"gameguru","symbol":"ggt","description":"GameGuru aims to be the first crypto-marketplace for digital gaming codes and e-gift cards. Digital card sales are a multi-billion-dollar industry with massive growth expectation: a turnover of $698.2 billion is expected worldwide in 2024. Traditional online marketplaces offers overpriced products, fraudulently obtained game keys (Labelled “Grey Marketplaces”) and, in most cases, none-instant delivery due to the high-risk of chargebacks and payment reversals. GameGuru, by relying on its own GGT token (BEP-20) as the only payment method, will be able to provide: - Lower prices simply by waiving the commission of marketplaces such as G2A (6 – 10% discount). An approximate 7 to 12% profit margin (depending on product) will remain. A portion of that profit will be going to the GGT token holders. - Zero risk products since all products are sourced from vetted European wholesale suppliers. - Instant delivery of the goods due to the irreversible nature of crypto transactions and through an API integration with the suppliers.","links":"https://gameguru.gg","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gameguru/logo.png"}
