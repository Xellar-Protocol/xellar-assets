{"name":"Major Frog","id":"major-frog","symbol":"major","description":"It all started the day of the LADEE launch. NASA thought it was just another mission: a mission designed to shield us from the truth. But they didn’t count on Major Frog. Thrown into the air by the force of the ignition, Major Frog soared higher than any frog had ever gone before. In that moment, he saw the truth—Earth was flat! There was no moon, no stars, nothing… just a world built on lies. Major Frog’s death should have been meaningless, an accident swept away by flames and dust. But his sacrifice became something else—a rallying cry. If there was no moon, why was LADEE even launched? Why did a frog have to die for nothing? Conspiracy theorists have heard the call! NASA, the government, everything—they’ve been hiding it all. No more. Because of Major Frog’s sacrifice, the truth will be revealed.","links":"https://themajorfrog.com/","market_cap":18195294,"market_cap_rank":1402,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/major-frog/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"CNyMaRR4krm1yAxfCvPXevNMArZZZk7sRqKwX68uCeJk"}}}
