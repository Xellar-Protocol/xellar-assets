{"name":"XL1","id":"xl1_ethereum","symbol":"xl1","description":"<h2>What is XL1 (by XYO)?</h2> <p><b>XL1</b> is the utility token of <b>XYO Layer One</b>, the first scalable data blockchain that brings verifiable information on-chain. XL1 pays gas and transaction fees (with a portion burned by activity), powers smart contracts, dApps, and validator rewards, enables bridging/wrapping to other chains, and incentivizes participation via staking and step-based rewards. The ecosystem is dual-token: XL1 runs the chain; XYO powers the contributor network—rewards, staking, governance, and security. XYO’s DePIN, trustless oracle of 10M+ nodes, plus Proof of Location and Proof of Origin, delivers trusted data for AI, RWA, geospatial intelligence, and location-based gaming.</p> <h2>What is XYO?</h2> <p>XYO, the first DePIN and trustless oracle, collects and verifies real-world data through a decentralized network of more than 10 million nodes, enabling Web2 and Web3 companies to integrate trusted real world information into their systems and also leveraging its proprietary <b>Proof of Location</b> and <b>Proof of Origin</b> technologies, which power applications in real-world assets (RWA), location-based gaming, geospatial intelligence, and other real-world experiences.</p> <h2>What is XYO Layer One?</h2> <p>XYO Layer One is a data blockchain built to verify and move verifiable real world information on chain for <b>AI, DePIN, RWA, Gaming</b> and other applications.</p> <p>It uses a dual token design where XYO powers the contributors ecosystem, rewards, staking, governance and security, and <b>XL1 is the gas and transaction token that runs the XYO Layer One blockchain.</b></p> <p>XL1 is the native utility token used for:</p> <ul> <li>Paying gas and transaction fees for all on chain activity. Activity burns a portion of fees.</li> <li>Powering smart contracts, dApps, and validator rewards on XYO Layer One.</li> <li>Incentivizing participation through staking and step based rewards inside the protocol.</li> <li>Bridging and wrapping for access on other chains.</li> </ul> <h2>How many XL1 tokens are there?</h2> <p>At launch there are 38 billion XL1, with about 5.7 billion initially circulating. Long term inflation is around 0.7% per year after the early emission era, and base fee burns plus slashing can offset issuance over time.</p> <p>Illustrative allocation and unlocks place the majority toward network emissions for node operators, with team and investor tokens on delayed cliffs and long vesting.</p> <h2>What makes the chain different?</h2> <p><b>Proof of Origin</b> and <b>Proof of Location</b> let devices attest to proximity and data lineage, so apps can trust where data came from and how it changed before it reaches a contract. These proofs are created at the edge with bound witness, then anchored on chain for integrity.</p> <p>The architecture is built for high-volume data. Step hashing and bound witness trees help compress and verify large flows, while the chain keeps a single shared ledger that supports parallelized work across apps.</p> <h2>Roadmap and status</h2> <p>XYO Layer One is live. Milestones include wallet releases, bridging, staking, and expanded SDK support. Additional XYO Layer One features will be rolled out over the next months.</p>","links":"https://xyo.network","market_cap":3739959,"market_cap_rank":2330,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/xl1/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf72ae3e0da743033abd7a407557d684c1ae66aed","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xf72ae3e0da743033abd7a407557d684c1ae66aed"}},"is_native":false}
