{"name":"Gamesta","id":"gamesta","symbol":"gsg","description":"Enter GAMESTA, the A.I. powered Guild, enabling investors to connect to and empower thousands of play-to-earn gamers around the world. The gaming industry is forecast to be valued at over $268 billion in the next 5 years. As the fastest growing sector in Crypto, Play-to-Earn is flipping the gaming industry on its head and with only 1% of global gamers currently playing Play-To-Earn based games, the stage is set for unprecedented growth. GAMESTA will enter the Game-Fi arena using proprietary AI and Machine Learning technology to improve decision making processes on both the Asset Acquisition and the Asset Deployment, ensuring maximum yield for investors. CopperLaunch is a perfect strategy to raise funds and launch the GSG token, as in essence GAMESTA is a fund, with the value of the GSG token directly linked to the Assets Under Management. The more raised, the higher the token price backed by a bigger asset base, therefore giving self perpetuating value. Other areas of business will include game development, community building, staking and VC investing into new projects.","links":"https://gamesta.ai","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gamesta/logo.png"}
