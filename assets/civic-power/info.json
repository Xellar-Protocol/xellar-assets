{"name":"Civic Power","id":"civic-power","symbol":"power","description":"Civic Power has developed a new way to vote from a smartphone that makes it impossible to tamper with or contradict the ballot. Our mobile application simultaneously allows a voter to: • remain anonymous, • check the content of his vote, • see his vote in the global count. With our distributed ballot book technology, the user can trust the non-centralized voting system unable to modify the votes of the participants. All votes are also publicly verifiable in real time, allowing anyone to recount them via the public distributed poll book. Each participant has a unique and anonymized identifier allowing them to verify their participation without revealing their identity.","links":"https://civicpower.io/power-token/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/civic-power/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8ce7fc007fc5d1dea63fed829e11eeddd6406dff"}}}
