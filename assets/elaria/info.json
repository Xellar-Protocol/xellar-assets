{"name":"Elaria","id":"elaria","symbol":"elr","description":"Elaria (ELR) is a blockchain-powered gaming project that brings a rich, immersive fantasy world to life through strategic gameplay and token-driven mechanics. Inspired by the lore of classic trading card games, Elaria introduces players to the mystical realm of Mytherra, where powerful sorcerers known as Planescallers compete to restore balance to the shattered magic of the universe. The project begins with a Telegram mini-app puzzle game, where players must solve magic-infused puzzles to gather mana, unlock spells, and strengthen their abilities. This acts as an entry point into the Elaria ecosystem, setting the stage for the eventual development of a full-scale strategic card battle game. By integrating blockchain technology and the ELR token, players gain real ownership of in-game assets and participate in a player-driven economy. Elaria aims to revolutionize digital gaming by offering a decentralized experience where strategy, skill, and ownership are at the forefront.","links":"https://www.elaria.xyz/","market_cap":35.01,"market_cap_rank":11632,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/elaria/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xff62028b335eb08532f142188d45abeee2428259","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xff62028b335eb08532f142188d45abeee2428259"}}}
