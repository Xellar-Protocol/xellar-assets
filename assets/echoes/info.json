{"name":"Echoes","id":"echoes","symbol":"echoes","description":"What is the project about? Echoes is a project in the realm of decentralized finance (DeFi) that introduces a unique token system focused on reflection rewards. Through dynamic Modes and randomized Events, Echoes creates an engaging ecosystem for wealth generation and collective growth. What makes your project unique? Echoes stands out with its implementation of the Randomized Reflection Scenario. Unlike traditional reflection tokens, Echoes concentrates rewards through Modes and Events, targeting specific holders for a more strategic distribution. This approach ensures a dynamic and inclusive experience for our community. History of your project. Echoes was conceptualized by a dedicated team of developers and blockchain enthusiasts who recognized the need for a more efficient reflection token system. Extensive research and testing were conducted to design a protocol that combines dynamic Modes, randomized Events, and a robust Oracle. The project has undergone thorough development and audits to ensure security and reliability. Whatâ€™s next for your project? Our roadmap focuses on continual development and improvement. We plan to expand our ecosystem, enhance the functionality of Modes and Events, and explore strategic partnerships. Community engagement and feedback will guide us in implementing new features to meet evolving needs. What can your token be used for? The Echoes token ($ECHOES) serves as the utility within our ecosystem. Holders benefit from unique reflection rewards generated through Modes and Events. Additionally, $ECHOES can be used for governance, enabling holders to participate in decision-making processes. We envision broader utility for $ECHOES within decentralized applications and services in the DeFi landscape.","links":"https://www.echoes-erc.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/echoes/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf07ebf00aa847bbb0057b92cb469747e2c7c8a4f"}}}
