Soviet scientists chose to use Moscow strays since they assumed that such animals had already learned to endure conditions of extreme cold and hunger. To get her used to spaceflight, she was kept in smaller and smaller cages. They then put it into a centrifuge that simulated the acceleration of a rocket during takeoff and subjected it to noises that mimicked the interior of a spacecraft Before the launch, one of the mission scientists took Laika home to play with his children.
