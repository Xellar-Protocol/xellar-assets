{"name":"Droid","id":"droid","symbol":"droid","description":"Droid is the community token powering Nakamoto_1, humanity's first-ever interplanetary treasure hunt to the Moon's unexplored south pole. Created for crypto enthusiasts and lunar pioneers alike, Droid fuels exploration, discovery, and rewards. Droid is naturally deflationary as liquidity pool proceeds go directly to the treasure chest on the Moon. It represents a historic leap, merging blockchain innovation with real-world adventure, marking a bold new chapter for space-bound communities. Droid was born out of Nakamoto_1's successful NFT drop where 24,000 NFTs were sold in 1 day.","links":"https://nakamoto1.space","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/droid/logo.png","detail_platform":{"stacks":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":"SP2EEV5QBZA454MSMW9W3WJNRXVJF36VPV17FFKYH.DROID"}}}
