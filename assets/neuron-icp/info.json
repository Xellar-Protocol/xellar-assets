{"name":"neuron ICP","id":"neuron-icp","symbol":"nicp","description":"nICP is a decentralised liquid staking derivative on the Internet computer protocol. It allows people to earn yield on their ICP while being fully liquid. The protocol is controlled and managed by the WaterNeuron DAO through staked WTN tokens, and thus fully decentralised. All the components of the protocol are fully on-chain. All the code is open source. It is the first fully decentralised LST on ICP.","links":"https://waterneuron.fi/","market_cap":2041627,"market_cap_rank":3162,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/neuron-icp/logo.png","detail_platform":{"internet-computer":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"buwm7-7yaaa-aaaar-qagva-cai"}}}
