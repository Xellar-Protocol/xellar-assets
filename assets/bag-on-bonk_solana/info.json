{"name":"Bag on Bonk","id":"bag-on-bonk_solana","symbol":"bag","description":"What Is BAG Token? BAG Token is a memecoin launched on Solana on July 5, 2025. The project is built around the backpack as a cultural symbol on Bonk, representing the idea of carrying value, memes, and identity across Web3. BAG Token has been a recognisable symbol within the Bonk ecosystem even prior to its official launch, serving as a cultural marker for Solana’s meme-fi community. In July 2025, the project underwent a community takeover, placing future development and direction under the control of its holder base. While its foundation is meme culture, BAG Token is also expanding into practical applications through gaming-focused decentralized applications (DApps) and staking. Its identity as the “backpack of the blockchain” reflects its dual role as both a cultural emblem and a functional Solana token.","links":"https://www.bag.red/","market_cap":125880,"market_cap_rank":6630,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bag-on-bonk_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"HMaJxXp3Ja81jSwigF6zGaMt79hNZuczrw6i7LjTbonk","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/HMaJxXp3Ja81jSwigF6zGaMt79hNZuczrw6i7LjTbonk"}},"is_native":false}
