{"name":"Knot Diffie-Hellman","id":"knot-diffie-hellman","symbol":"knot","description":"Quant.Bond is a Quantum DeSci platform that supports the development, research, and funding of Quantum, Post-Quantum, and Quantum AI algorithms for the next generation of computing technology. Knot Diffie-Hellman is the first quantum experiment on Quant.Bond. Itâ€™s a revolutionary Post-Quantum key exchange scheme that leverages knot theory, semigroup actions, and finite-type invariants for secure and efficient shared secret generation. By combining quantum resistance with advanced topology, it ensures robust security, making it ideal for Web3, TLS, and future key exchange security needs.","links":"https://www.quant.bond/","market_cap":3977634,"market_cap_rank":2536,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/knot-diffie-hellman/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"7RDvypx3p9EWq4nZZKux1ZQAc7DUWXpHTVKxCCnupump"}}}
