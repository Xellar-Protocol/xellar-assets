{"name":"Punk Panda Messenger","id":"punk-panda-messenger","symbol":"ppm","description":"PunkPanda is a project focused on creating privacy-focused products that change the paradigm of data ownership by empowering users to keep their data private. The PunkPanda team launched the project with the release of their encrypted messenger, the PandaApp, with features such as texting, calling, video-calling, and file sharing. Unlike other encrypted messengers, the PandaApp was the first encrypted messaging app to reward its users for both using the app and referring their friends. Users of the app are rewarded in the projectâ€™s native token called PPM. Thanks to the apps unique value proposition, the PandaApp experienced explosive growth since its release. In the first 11 months, the community of PandaApp users grew to over 1,000,000 members. Having started as an app with token-based rewards, the PunkPanda project naturally expanded its reach into the world of DeFi with the development of the PunkPanda Farm. The PunkPanda Farm is a decentralized Web3 protocol where members of the PunkPanda community will be able to buy, trade, and earn all in one place. It will also feature staking pools and farms where users can earn PPM tokens and earn even more rewards for providing liquidity to the PPM-BBN trading pair. The PunkPanda Farm went live on July 29th, 12pm EST (USA).","links":"https://www.punkpandafarm.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/punk-panda-messenger/logo.png"}
