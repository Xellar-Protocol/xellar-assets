Doaibu is mainly using polygon for connecting and building blockchain networks. We offer multiple services to our investors unlike other coins in the market. The core services that we offer include Token Swap, Launchpad, Staking & Farming. Continuous development, transparency, inventiveness, profitability and community are our basic beliefs. We are currently in a discussion with different coins for informal partnerships, we have faith in working in association rather than rivalry. The partnerships will be centered around benefits for both communities. Project leaders and innovators will directly apply for fundraising without a third party. Users can easily invest in the initial phase of the project and also track their investments without effort. Doaibu will also have in-built staking and farming modules that helps users to earn money while holding $DOA tokens.","links":"https://doaibu.app/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/doaibu/logo.png"}
