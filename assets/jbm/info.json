{"name":"JBM","id":"jbm","symbol":"$jbm","description":"$JBM is a community-driven memecoin inspired by the adventurous spirit of a bold character from classic tales of exploration and growth. It aims to disrupt the crypto space by fostering a genuine, organic community built on transparency and trust. The project is designed for long-term sustainability with robust tokenomics. The team has already burned 45% of the total token supply and 50% of the liquidity pool which is also burned, ensuring a deflationary model. Additionally, 2.5% of the liquidity has been locked for 2 years, with the fees generated from this additional liquidity pool being allocated for buyback and burn mechanisms. A further 2.5% is reserved for growth funds, which are also locked for 2 years, ensuring steady development over time. $JBM focuses on creating a sustainable ecosystem where the community plays a central role in shaping its future, aiming to redefine the memecoin space with integrity and longevity.","links":"https://www.jbmcto.xyz/","market_cap":18615.91,"market_cap_rank":7145,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/jbm/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"4iNowernM7VnmA79FyedcUGnM22GMm2keEtwbaJepump"}}}
