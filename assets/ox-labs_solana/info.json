{"name":"OX Labs","id":"ox-labs_solana","symbol":"oxlabs","description":"OX Labs is a decentralized AI coordination protocol built on Solana. It provides users with access to a growing library of advanced AI models without subscriptions or usage-based fees. Users gain access through token-based permissions that require holding $OXLABS. All operations, including tool management, treasury spending, and marketing decisions, are governed transparently via an on-chain DAO. Swap fees collected through the platform are used to purchase and burn $OXLABS, reinforcing a deflationary and community-aligned token economy.","links":"https://oxlabs.ai/","market_cap":4737.88,"market_cap_rank":12438,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ox-labs_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"H52iXFyxXJYD9VV6h9cCPk4Le1uA23D8gUKbsoGyjray","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/H52iXFyxXJYD9VV6h9cCPk4Le1uA23D8gUKbsoGyjray"}},"is_native":false}
