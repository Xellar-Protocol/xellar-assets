{"name":"Arcadeum","id":"arcadeum_arbitrum-one","symbol":"arc","description":"Arcadeum's mission is twofold. Create the most transparent, fair, and ethical online betting platform in the world. Create the Uniswap of on-chain betting. Online betting has been dominated by evil people, organized crime, and even state-sponsored terrorists groups since its inception. This is widely documented and has gone on for years. Arcadeum is a community-driven, transparent, and decentralized viable alternative. Principles Online betting should be fun and exciting but focused on connecting people together. Online betting should be as safe as possible without preventing users from managing their own risk. It is not wrong for the \"house\" of an online betting platform to have an \"edge\" and be projected to turn a profit. The \"house\" of an online betting platform should be public, solvent, and available to any liquidity provider. This includes the players themselves. Random number generation must be provably fair. This provable fairness must be transparent for all to see, such as on a public blockchain. Arcadeum is a step towards a world where people can enjoy online betting without financially enabling human trafficking, forced labor, extreme worker exploitation, or predatory marketing. Arcadeum is a step towards a world where players understand the risks, odds, payouts, and mechanisms behind the games they play. Prioritizing transparency, decentralization, and censorship resistance, Arcadeum is a true on-chain movement.","links":"https://arcadeum.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/arcadeum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x7f465507f058e17ad21623927a120ac05ca32741","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/arbitrum/tokens/0x7f465507f058e17ad21623927a120ac05ca32741"}},"is_native":false}
