{"name":"Pochi Inu","id":"pochi-inu","symbol":"pochi","description":"Pochi Inu is a small, Japanese bred dog known for its adorable pitch black eyes and eggshell accented golden fur. Staying true to its Shiba Inu genes, it swirls its tail counterclockwise when happy and ecstatic. The lighter colour of a Pochi’s fur above its eyes creates an illusion of eyebrows, making it distinguishable from any other breed of Shiba Inu’s. We inspire to be identifiably different from other doge coins, and so we are proud to introduce to you - Pochi Inu!","links":"https://pochiinu.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pochi-inu/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8eb1779a32678452eb273a22d413207299904d90"}}}
