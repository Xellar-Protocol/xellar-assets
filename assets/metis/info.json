{"name":"Metis MTS","id":"metis","symbol":"mts","description":"Metis believes in empowering individuals to attain their true potential through education. However, education is frequently underutilized due to difficulties of accessing education and students may not always have the right incentive to complete their education. Metis solves this issue by providing a direct economic incentive for users which is representative of the economic value to society that is not captured by the users themselves. Through Metis, students have a financial incentive to study and pick up skills that are in demand within society. These students learning and picking up skills that the industry is lacking can earn money while being educated. Metis enables this through our innovative proof-of-work to mine new MTS token, To gain MTS tokens, users will need to complete milestones in their online courses. For each milestone completed, the users will receive a corresponding amount of MTS token as a reward for their work. The rewards received by the users will commensurate with their commitment to the learning and the expected gain by society from the completion of the course. As an added incentive for completing the courses, students will also receive a graduation certificate along with any awards that they have received during their education journey. These certificates and awards will be issued as non-fungible tokens existing as ERC721 tokens on the Ethereum Blockchain.","links":"https://wemetis.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/metis/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa9598333b99d14d90bc81cad8af82c4c70625e75"}}}
