Anybody with 1% of COMP delegated to their address can propose a governance action; these are simple or complex sets of actions, such as adding support for a new asset, changing an asset’s collateral factor, changing a market’s interest rate model, or changing any other parameter or variable of the protocol that the current administrator can modify.","links":"https://compound.finance/governance/comp","market_cap":233805604,"market_cap_rank":245,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/compound-governance-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc00e94cb662c3520282e6f5717214004a7f26888","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xc00e94cb662c3520282e6f5717214004a7f26888"}},"is_native":false}
