{"name":"uPark","id":"upark","symbol":"upark","description":"As significantly as technology and industries have evolved over recent decades, parking space management has remained relatively slow to adapt to the needs of modern society’s motorists. The age-old problems of lost time, fuel, and traffic congestion still plague areas like city centres, shopping malls, and airports, resulting in increased stress, higher costs at both the individual and city levels, and lost time. In other words, parking management in its current state delivers a poor user experience and can be quite a headache. uPark presents a mobile-based parking reservation solution that, through innovative use of blockchain and NFT technology, provides a sustainable solution that: ● Helps drivers easily reserve parking spaces ahead of time and navigate to them, reducing uncertainty and stress. ● Reduces the cumulative negative environmental impact of thousands of motorists driving around searching for a parking space. ● Saves time and money at both the individual and city scales. Aimed to introduce sustainability to the parking management problem space, uPark will be built on the Elrond blockchain, the first European carbon-negative blockchain, to manage its scalable network of parking lots. Additionally, through an innovative NFT campaign, users will have the opportunity to reap rewards by owning digital representations of parking spaces in different cities to generate multiple revenue streams, including advertising, personal NFT marketplaces, and NFT staking.","links":"https://upark.city/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/upark/logo.png","detail_platform":{"elrond":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"UPARK-982dd6"}}}
