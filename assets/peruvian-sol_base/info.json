{"name":"Peruvian Sol","id":"peruvian-sol_base","symbol":"wpen","description":"wPEN is a fully collateralized stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the Peruvian sol (PEN). Issued and governed by a Ripio subsidiary, it brings PEN on-chain so Peruvians and global users can transact, save, and build on decentralized networks in their local currency. Backed by Ripio’s since-2013 track record in LATAM, wPEN enables faster, cheaper PEN transfers, FX and remittance flows, DeFi trading and lending, and seamless on/off-ramps and payments without leaving the PEN unit of account.","links":"https://ripio.com/es/criptos/stablecoins-locales","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/peruvian-sol/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x4f34c8b3b5fb6d98da888f0fea543d4d9c9f2ebe","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x4f34c8b3b5fb6d98da888f0fea543d4d9c9f2ebe"}},"is_native":false}
