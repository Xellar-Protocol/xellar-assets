GAMEPLAY: Players focus mainly entirely on the defeat of the enemies using the weapons given to the player. These weapons are firearms or some other long-range weapons and can be used in combination with other tools such as grenades for indirect offense, armor for additional defense, or accessories such as telescopic sights to modify the behavior of the weapons. Players earn coins based on the number of kills and can purchase new characters/guns using the coins 1. Each Level gets harder with more enemies and less timing 2. Players can also make use of guns achieved from killed enemies. While shooter games can be entertaining, they have also been criticized for promoting violence and desensitizing players to real-world violence. It is important for players to remember that shooter games are just a form of entertainment and should not be taken as a reflection of real-life actions.","links":"https://blastfrontiers.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/blast-frontiers/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa9cf023a5f6de6863f02761f6166799ec2595758"}}}
