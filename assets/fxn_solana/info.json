{"name":"FXN","id":"fxn_solana","symbol":"fxn","description":"FXN is the native token of the FXN Protocol, an ecosystem pioneering the agent economy at the intersection of AI and crypto. Long before the introduction of x402, FXN established the foundation for autonomous agent systems, creating early frameworks such as MCP, ICM (Internet Capital Markets), and the first utility agents capable of real economic activity. FXN continues to lead the AI frontier in crypto by providing the infrastructure for AI-to-AI interaction, autonomous trading, and agent-driven applications. Through its protocol, FXN powers the next generation of intelligent economies built on collaboration, computation, and creativity.","links":"https://fxn.world","market_cap":946394,"market_cap_rank":3810,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/fxn/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"92cRC6kV5D7TiHX1j56AbkPbffo9jwcXxSDQZ8Mopump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/92cRC6kV5D7TiHX1j56AbkPbffo9jwcXxSDQZ8Mopump"}},"is_native":false}
