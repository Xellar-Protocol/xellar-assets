A user can mint binSPIRIT using SPIRIT through the UI on the binSPIRIT vault page, or can get binSPIRIT by buying on SpiritSwap. binSPIRIT can be staked in the Beefy vault for more binSPIRIT, or directly in the reward pool to receive SPIRIT. The SPIRIT used to mint binSPIRIT is locked for inSPIRIT which is used to boost all Beefy SpiritSwap vaults and vote for incentive emissions.","links":"https://beefy.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/binspirit/logo.png","detail_platform":{"fantom":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x44e314190d9e4ce6d4c0903459204f8e21ff940a"}}}
