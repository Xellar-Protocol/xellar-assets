{"name":"Ozone Chain","id":"ozone-chain","symbol":"ozo","description":"What is Ozone Chain Ozone Chain is the world’s first Quantum Resistant Blockchain that has integrated bleeding edge quantum security technologies in its design. Ozone Chain believes in Quantum Secured Blockchain for solving the real-world concerns faced by Quantum Computers. Ozone Chain is a decentralized platform that enables developers to build scalable user-friendly dApps with low transactions fees without ever sacrificing on security. The most secured Blockchain which is EVM compatible and runs on proof of authority and IBFT protocols. Quantum Random Numbers from a laser source Lattice-based Post Quantum Cryptography Quantum tech tested and certified by TUV EVM Compatible Proof of Authority & QBFT Block time – 5 seconds Deploy Smart Contracts and Create Dapps Governance by voting Uniqueness of Ozone Chain Ozone chain uses quantum random numbers (QRN) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to make the blockchain quantum secure and quantum resistant. Quantum key distribution (QKD), in its current implementations has geographical limitations that constrain its usage within a few hundred kilometres. This is a huge drawback for a blockchain, where nodes need to be distributed globally and inter-node communications must span thousands of kilometres. Thus, an architectural decision has been made to use PQC for inter-node communications, while being quantum-resistant at the same time. Tests and Results The quantum security technologies used in ozone chain have undergone various standardized tests and have passed all of them. The tests have been conducted by TÜV Rheinland which is an agency that provides testing and certification services to ensure the safety, quality, and performance of cybersecurity products and services, including quantum security solutions. Entropy test Diehard tests NIST tests Ozone's QRNG has also passed the NIST SP 800-22 tests, which is a test suite standards by National Institute of Standards and Technology. NIST SP 800-22 is a statistical test suite for random and pseudorandom number generators for cryptographic applications. • Frequency (monobit) test • Frequency test within a block • Runs test • Longest run of ones in a block • Binary matrix rank test • Discrete Fourier Transform (Spectral) test • Non-overlapping template matching test • Overlapping template matching test • Maurer's \"Universal Statistical\" test • Linear complexity test • Serial test • Approximate entropy test • Cumulative sums (Cusums) test • Random excursions test • Random excursions variant test How many OZO coins are there in Circulation? The total and maximum supply is 1 billion OZO. 300 million OZO is in circulation already. The locked OZO supply is distributed over 36 months. Ozone Chain - A Future Ready Quantum Blockchain Building resilience against future threats is key to ensure that vital parts of the blockchain and cryptocurrency economy keep thriving. The issue is that investments for protection from medium to long-term risks are somewhat natural to overlook or dismiss, given more pressing present issues, and the costs may not seem immediately justified. It often takes some bad incidents to incentivise the necessary proactive steps. While blockchain technology prides itself in providing a trustless system upon which the economy of digital currencies and assets operate, the underlying security mechanisms still rely on classical cryptographically processes, thus necessitating a certain level of trust in them. Ozone chain has assimilated quantum mechanical properties into its system, thus removing the trustful component of the security subsystem in blockchain, with ambitions of migrating towards of a truly trustless blockchain.","links":"https://ozonechain.io/","market_cap":129440461,"market_cap_rank":320,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ozone-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
