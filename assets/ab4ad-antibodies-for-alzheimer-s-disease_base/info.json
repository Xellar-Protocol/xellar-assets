{"name":"AB4AD (Antibodies for Alzheimer's Disease)","id":"ab4ad-antibodies-for-alzheimer-s-disease_base","symbol":"ab4ad","description":"Ab4AD (Antibodies for Alzheimer’s Disease) is a research initiative from Dr. Daniel Z. Bar (Tel Aviv University) that investigates the pathogen hypothesis of Alzheimer’s: common infections (notably herpes and P. gingivalis) appear to modulate AD risk. The team will analyze blood and saliva from dementia-free elderly individuals and compare them to AD patients and younger controls to identify protective antibodies. Instead of only targeting protein aggregation, Ab4AD focuses on why some exposed individuals stay dementia-free, using their natural antibody profiles as blueprints for protection. Funded and tracked through Molecule Catalyst, enabling visible milestones and community governance via IP Tokens (IPTs).","links":"https://molecule.xyz/ipts/ab4ad","market_cap":67788,"market_cap_rank":7695,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ab4ad-antibodies-for-alzheimer-s-disease_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x57414656ac535680367f519eec9f0d7ffe99e2d0","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x57414656ac535680367f519eec9f0d7ffe99e2d0"}},"is_native":false}
