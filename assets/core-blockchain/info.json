{"name":"Core Blockchain","id":"core-blockchain","symbol":"xcb","description":"• Ecosystem Development: Building a robust ecosystem of applications, services, and developer tools. • Layer 1 Blockchain: Ylem language enabling larger smart contract architectures. • Built using the Edwards Curve ED448, Goldilocks cryptography. • Accessible Development Platform: CBC20 Token Standard. • Interoperability: Enabling cross-chain transactions enhances liquidity and promotes collaboration between different ecosystems. • Modernized PoW: A True Decentralization focused on CPU mining. • Community Governance: Core DAO Network. • Environmental Sustainability: Low-energy Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism called PoDE (Proof of Distributed Efficiency). • Resilient Infrastructure. • Adoption and Partnerships. • A unique feature of Core Coin (XCB) is its interconnection with a peer-to-peer mesh network, Luna Mesh. This innovative approach aims to reduce dependence on the public internet, reinforcing the platform’s commitment to decentralization and user sovereignty. • The Mining Algorithm is RandomY • Verified transactions in +-42 seconds, 6 Blocks for a verified tx, 1 blocked mined every 7 seconds, 5 coins per block.","links":"https://coreblockchain.net/","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/core-blockchain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
