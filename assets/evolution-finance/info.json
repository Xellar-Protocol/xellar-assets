{"name":"Evolution Finance","id":"evolution-finance","symbol":"evn","description":"Evolution Finance is a self-funded project that will change the way users interact with DeFi locked liquidity and money markets. Evolution Finance is targeting DeFi lending of the top 50 ERC20 altcoins and ERC-wrapped native coins, with a fair token distribution model at launch. We believe a fair token distribution is key to building the community that a dominating DeFi platform needs. At launch 100% of EVN tokens will be made available through liquidity pools on Uniswap.","links":"https://www.evolution.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/evolution-finance/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x9af15d7b8776fa296019979e70a5be53c714a7ec"}}}
