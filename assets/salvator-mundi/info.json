{"name":"Salvator Mundi","id":"salvator-mundi","symbol":"mundi","description":"$MUNDI represents a paradigm shift in how cultural symbols are monetized in the digital age. By combining the memetic power of Salvator Mundi with the market dynamics of crypto, this project has the potential to redefine art’s role in the global digital economy. The painting's mystique is not rooted solely in its religious subject matter but in the story behind it: a missing masterpiece, debates over its history, and its emergence as a symbol of art’s commodification in the modern age. The Salvator Mundi became an idea greater than the artwork itself, a meme tied to exclusivity, cultural capital, and the rising financial power of Saudi Arabia. This memetic resonance forms the foundation of $MUNDI, a meme-coin that captures the intrigue and symbolic weight of the Salvator Mundi painting in the digital age.","links":"https://www.lostdavinci.com","market_cap":7321760,"market_cap_rank":2102,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/salvator-mundi/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"4BBjpGwLgGmUxtT82YFK9xMhcvyy3zgf3HpxTRip1YoU"}}}
