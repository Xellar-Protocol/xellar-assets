{"name":"Spawn","id":"spawn_solana","symbol":"spawn","description":"Spawn is pioneering an associative memory system—the foundation for truly self-learning AI in robotics. Unlike traditional models that rely on rigid datasets and constant retraining, this system mimics human-like recall, enabling robots to form dynamic connections between experiences, adapt to their environments, and improve autonomously over time. This breakthrough unlocks continuous learning in real-world scenarios. The $SPAWN token is required for developer access. Spawn also provides a low-latency VR teleoperation system that delivers global, real-time control of advanced humanoid and industrial robots. The $SPAWN token facilitates payments between users and teleoperated robots on a per-minute basis, allowing individuals or companies to pay for control or charge users for access to their robots.","links":"https://sp4wn.com","market_cap":102593,"market_cap_rank":6951,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/spawn_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"FrWgXau6Y2YWj4FZbd3mNcDTi3nAx1D5zr8j6fMmpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/FrWgXau6Y2YWj4FZbd3mNcDTi3nAx1D5zr8j6fMmpump"}},"is_native":false}
