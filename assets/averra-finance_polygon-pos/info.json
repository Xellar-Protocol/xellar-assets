{"name":"Averra Finance","id":"averra-finance_polygon-pos","symbol":"avr","description":"Averra Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) project designed to provide passive income through an auto-compounding token model. Operating on the Polygon network, it offers a fixed maximum supply of 15 million tokens, ensuring controlled inflation. The protocol automatically mints new tokens at a rate of 0.4% every 12 hours, which are directly distributed to holders without the need for staking or manual claiming. This mechanism incentivizes long-term holding and participation in the ecosystem. Averra Finance supports multi-chain interoperability, including Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon, enhancing scalability and flexibility. The project emphasizes decentralized governance, planning to implement community-driven decision-making processes. With features like a hard-capped supply, automatic rewards, and a focus on community engagement, Averra Finance aims to offer a sustainable and user-friendly DeFi experience.","links":"https://averra.finance","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/averra-finance_polygon-pos/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xcc0643b786d8b566a98e85dde48077239eaa8598","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/polygon_pos/tokens/0xcc0643b786d8b566a98e85dde48077239eaa8598"}},"is_native":false}
