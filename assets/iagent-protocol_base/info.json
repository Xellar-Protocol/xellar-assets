The iAgent protocol creates Agents that embody the user’s personal gaming strategies, styles, and creativity all rolled into one. Developed from the user’s game footage, an Agent is a trainable digital representation of the user’s gaming persona that they control and monetize. iAgent protocol proposes a comprehensive solution that combines AI, Blockchain, and Gaming into a single, decentralized platform. It utilizes a consumer grade GPU computing power through Decentralized GPU Infrastructure Network in short ComputeHub for training intelligent Agents, a MarketHub for trading Agents and GameHub where these Agents are rented or leased and compete against other gamers.","links":"https://www.iagentpro.com/","market_cap":58641,"market_cap_rank":7954,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/iagent-protocol/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x521ebb84ea82ee65154b68ecfe3a7292fb3779d6","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x521ebb84ea82ee65154b68ecfe3a7292fb3779d6"}},"is_native":false}
