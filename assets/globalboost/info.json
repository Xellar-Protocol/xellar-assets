It is a fork of Litecoin and has a 10% pre-mine. 50% of the pre-mined coins will be distributed to wounded soldiers on a tiered “Reach & Release” timescale with a total payout of $100+ million to charity. The other 50% of the pre-mine will be used to develop an advertising platform. There will be 1 billion GlobalBoost coins minted. A new block will be created every 30 seconds with a block reward of 95 coins. This block reward halves every 4 years.","links":"http://bsty.org","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/globalboost/logo.png"}
