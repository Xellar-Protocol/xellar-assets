{"name":"MoneyArk","id":"moneyark","symbol":"mark","description":"MoneyArk Reserve is a decentralized banking platform aimed at protecting and increasing wealth in the cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi) sectors. Inspired by Noah's Ark, it serves as a digital haven for the preservation and growth of financial value. The core feature of the platform is the Algorithm Vault, which autonomously trades to stabilize and increase the value of the $Mark token. Users can deposit USDC to earn long-term returns, and additional income can be gained through trading fee dividends by holding $Mark tokens. MoneyArk's code is immutable, offering a secure and decentralized tool for yield generation, particularly suitable for those who want to maximize their USDC deposit returns while minimizing the risks associated with other stablecoins. The platform caters to a variety of DeFi participants, including users who earn daily returns by depositing USDC in the Algorithm Vault and holders who enhance the value of their assets by owning $Mark tokens. Additionally, MoneyArk employs incentive measures such as trading fee dividends and the creation and maintenance of a Mark-USDC liquidity pool to attract $Mark holders.","links":"https://moneyark.io/","market_cap":11182.73,"market_cap_rank":7201,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/moneyark/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xaf1eeb83c364ad9ffeb5f97f223c1705d4810033"}}}
