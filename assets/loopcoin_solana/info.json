{"name":"Loopcoin","id":"loopcoin_solana","symbol":"lpc","description":"Loopcoin ($LPC) is a deflationary token with a unique reinvestment mechanism. A 0.25% fee on every buy and 0.25% fee on every sell is collected into a transparent treasury. The treasury uses these funds to buy back $LPC tokens from the open market and permanently burn them — reducing circulating supply over time. 50% of Tokens (500 million) are Locked via Smart Contract until 11/01/2025 and will vest very slowly thereafter.","links":"https://www.theloopcoin.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/loopcoin_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"EJtj4gsUNJsuhp2YuP96mq5Hfp2GYhP79nTyb9arpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/EJtj4gsUNJsuhp2YuP96mq5Hfp2GYhP79nTyb9arpump"}},"is_native":false}
