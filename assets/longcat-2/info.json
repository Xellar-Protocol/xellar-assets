{"name":"Longcat","id":"longcat-2","symbol":"shiro","description":"SHIRO (Longcat) is a community-driven meme token based on one of the earliest internet memes, Longcat (2004). The project aims to revive meme culture in crypto by giving tribute to a legendary figure that predates even Doge and Pepe. SHIRO has no presale, no VCs, and no taxes — it is fully owned by the community. With a focus on decentralization and grassroots participation, the project is actively building a social ecosystem through memes, Telegram raids, and Twitter campaigns. SHIRO is not just a token, but a cultural movement to remind crypto what memes truly are.","links":"https://shirolongcat.fun/","market_cap":142563,"market_cap_rank":6122,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/longcat-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"CLEjjvLaGoQjGxu1N3iVvjaCxDVtEZv4YJ3pSoAYpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/CLEjjvLaGoQjGxu1N3iVvjaCxDVtEZv4YJ3pSoAYpump"}}}
