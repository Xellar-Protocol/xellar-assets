{"name":"BEATER","id":"beater","symbol":"beatr","description":"BEATR is a token on the Avalanche blockchain that captures the spirit of every scraped-together, duct-taped chapter in our lives. It’s a meme token—but not just for laughs. BEATR celebrates the beater car: that rattling, wheezing ride you prayed would start each morning. The kind of vehicle held together by rust, zip ties, and hope. It’s unreliable, unsightly, and undeniably necessary—just like some of the choices we make in the crypto space. In a market obsessed with speed, polish, and flashy “Lambo” dreams, BEATR is a reminder that not everyone starts with a clean wallet or pristine portfolio. Sometimes, you limp through the bear market in a dented hatchback with three functioning gears—and that’s okay. BEATR leans into that chaos and honors the hustle. It’s the token you pick up when you’ve been rugged, rekt, and road-worn, but still show up for another day of degenerate trading. Built on Avalanche for its low fees and fast transactions (because no one driving a beater can afford high gas), BEATR is fueled by a community that’s been through it. It memes the madness and jokes about the journey, but under the hood is a project that values resilience, authenticity, and survival. Whether you’re cruising or broken down on the side of the road, BEATR is the token that rides with you. It might not get you far fast—but it’ll get you there eventually. Probably. Just check the oil.","links":"https://www.avaxbeater.com/","market_cap":124342,"market_cap_rank":6323,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/beater/logo.png","detail_platform":{"avalanche":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x870982d17cf51d3c304833924eac0ceec4183099","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/avax/tokens/0x870982d17cf51d3c304833924eac0ceec4183099"}}}
