{"name":"Stabull Finance","id":"stabull-finance_base","symbol":"stabul","description":"Stabull Finance is a decentralized exchange (DEX) focused exclusively on stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). Deployed across multiple blockchains, it offers low-slippage, low-fee swaps between listed stablecoins and RWAs on supported networks. Stabull uses a next-generation Automated Market Maker (AMM) powered by off-chain price oracles to closely track real-world FX and commodity prices. This oracle-based design improves price accuracy, enhances capital efficiency, and reduces peg pressure for issuers, while delivering better execution for traders. The platform currently supports a mix of USD and non-USD fiat-backed stablecoins, as well as tokenized precious metals, with additional assets added in curated batches. Liquidity providers earn a share of swap fees and may participate in Stabull’s Liquidity Mining Program to earn $STABUL tokens, which enable governance and reward allocation across pools.","links":"https://stabull.finance","market_cap":167117,"market_cap_rank":6193,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/stabull-finance/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6722f882cc3a1b1034893efa9764397c88897892"}},"is_native":false}
