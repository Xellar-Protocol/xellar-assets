{"name":"MicrovisionChain","id":"microvisionchain","symbol":"space","description":"What is the project about? MicroVisionChain (MVC) is a blockchain that solves the blockchain trilemma and is born for the Web3 Era. What makes your project unique? MVC is a UTXO-model public blockchain based on PoW consensus. It aims to ultimately achieve scaling with the high-concurrency feature of the UTXO model. Combined with Layer-1 high-performance smart contract and DID solution, MVC will become the perfect blockchain for massive Web3 applications to develop on. History of your project. MVC is not a new public chain that came out of thin air. Its underlying technology comes from the UTXO+POW model, which has been verified for over ten years. MVC Labs members include experts and scientists from all over the world. Some have years of research experience in big blocks and scaling solutions. MetaTXID, MetaID, and MetaContract are the world’s leading independent research results from cross-region research teams; Parts of the members are Bitcoin node engineers and infrastructure builders who are competent at data services and node building in practice. What’s next for your project? Become a pure layer1 blockchain capable of running large-scale Web3 applications. What can your token be used for? $SPACE is the native coin on MVC. It represents the available resources on the chain, which can be used for contract running gas, transactions, on-chain storage and many other functions. $SPACE can be used for a contract running gas, transactions, on-chain storage and many other functions (Usually 100MB resources can be used for about 1B times of transactions, execute 10K smart contracts, and store 100 photos).","links":"https://www.microvisionchain.com/","market_cap":23185912,"market_cap_rank":1012,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/microvisionchain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
