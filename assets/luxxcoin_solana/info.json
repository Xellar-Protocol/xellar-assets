{"name":"Luxxcoin","id":"luxxcoin_solana","symbol":"lux","description":"Luxxcoin is a Solana-based “MemeFi” project that blends meme culture with game-style, on-chain participation. The protocol runs public 60-day seasons scored by a transparent formula that emphasizes time-weighted holdings, holding streaks, efficient entries, and low churn. Each season ends with a snapshot at 12:00 UTC and distribution at 18:00 UTC on the same day. The LUX token (total supply 100B) underpins the ecosystem, with 45B LUX allocated across 45 seasons (~7.5 years). There is no presale or transfer tax. Governance and treasury operations are managed by multi-sig, and official links are published through one verified handle and the project website to reduce impersonation risk.","links":"https://www.luxxcoin.io/","market_cap":80833539,"market_cap_rank":483,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/luxxcoin_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"3bSGpKYPut6RXDxp41nvb2GM7eR4kEmJExFFHoYkW3w2","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/3bSGpKYPut6RXDxp41nvb2GM7eR4kEmJExFFHoYkW3w2"}},"is_native":false}
