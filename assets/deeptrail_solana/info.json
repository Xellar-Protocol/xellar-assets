{"name":"Deeptrail","id":"deeptrail_solana","symbol":"dptl","description":"Deeptrail is a Solana-based AI-powered analytics protocol focused on detecting on-chain anomalies, wallet behaviors, and market manipulation patterns in real time. The project combines a custom-built scanner engine with AI logic to provide forensic-grade insights for traders and analysts. Deeptrail offers a live terminal, a fully functional Chrome Extension, and an upcoming Telegram Mini App that allows token analysis and direct trading from chat. The $DPTL token acts as the access layer to unlock advanced features, roles, and signal utilities across the platform. Deeptrail is not a trading tool — it's a predictive infrastructure for those who move before the crowd. All key logic is verifiable on-chain and open to community feedback.","links":"https://www.deeptrailforge.com/","market_cap":2598.74,"market_cap_rank":12978,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/deeptrail_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"3EKXyESibGwt12Q4kxA9PwuJrfGt6rAX7AQ6dufKpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/3EKXyESibGwt12Q4kxA9PwuJrfGt6rAX7AQ6dufKpump"}},"is_native":false}
