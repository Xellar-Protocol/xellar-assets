This charming character, accompanied by the famous song “El Sapo Pepe” (over 800 million views), has been cherished by generations. With its catchy lyrics—\"It has no tail, and it’s colored green, it jumps round and around the yard\"—the song became a staple of childhood for many Argentinians. The creator behind this iconic character is Analía García. In 1988, El Sapo Pepe was introduced on Carlitos Balá’s show, where it played the role of a toad that gave gifts to children. García drew inspiration from the toads in her garden, reimagining them to challenge the negative stereotypes often associated with these creatures in children's stories. Her goal was to present a friendly, approachable toad that children could love. The accompanying song, with its playful rhythm and cheerful vibe, became an instant hit.","links":"https://www.pepethetoad.com/","market_cap":1289917,"market_cap_rank":3663,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/el-sapo-pepe/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x69e15ab0fd240de689d09e4851181a6667968008"}}}
