{"name":"Ethereum Yield","id":"ethereum-yield","symbol":"ethy","description":"Users are incentivised to stake Uniswap liquidity provider tokens. Fees from these tokens are farmed. A percentage of these fees goes toward the autonomous strategies like liquidating LP tokens, and performing an (`ETH-ETHY`) buy back (increasing the price). Any purchased ETHY tokens will be distributed to stakers/farmers ETHY implements a strong deflationary force on each token. Every time an ETHY token is transferred, a small fee is taken, which is returned to the farmers. This mechanism incentivises holding and farming. ETHY holders will be able to vote on proposalsâ€“ so long as they have staked liquidity in the pools. The community will decide everything from developer fees and site design to the exact farming options available.","links":"https://ethereumyield.farm/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ethereum-yield/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd1afbccc9a2c2187ea544363b986ea0ab6ef08b5"}}}
