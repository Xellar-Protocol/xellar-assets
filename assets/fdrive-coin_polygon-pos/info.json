{"name":"FDrive Coin","id":"fdrive-coin_polygon-pos","symbol":"fdc","description":"FooDriver is introduced as the world's first decentralized application (dApp) designed to revolutionize the shopping, selling, and delivery market. Built on the Polygon blockchain, the project leverages a smart contract to ensure 100% fulfillment of all obligations for its users—consumers, delivery personnel, and business owners—while operating with minimal human intervention. This innovative approach guarantees all participants are insured against losses. The dApp utilizes its native FooDriver token for all transactions, which can be instantly exchanged for local currency or traded on cryptocurrency exchanges, offering a significant benefit to tourists and business travelers. For consumers, it provides a seamless ordering experience with guaranteed quality and fast delivery, along with a robust refund system. Delivery personnel benefit from guaranteed pay, no application commissions, and the opportunity for main or supplementary income. Business and restaurant owners gain access to a highly motivated delivery network, drastically reduced commission fees (3-15% compared to the 25-35% charged by traditional delivery agencies worldwide), and advanced marketing tools like geo-push and personalized targeting to attract and retain customers. FooDriver aims to establish a dominant position in the Web 3.0 delivery space by creating a more efficient, transparent, and profitable ecosystem for everyone involved.","links":"https://foodriver.site/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/fdrive-coin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x40445993b0122456ec9e5c679f4f0485e1a5b474","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/polygon_pos/tokens/0x40445993b0122456ec9e5c679f4f0485e1a5b474"}},"is_native":false}
