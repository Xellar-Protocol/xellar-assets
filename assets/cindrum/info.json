{"name":"Cindrum","id":"cindrum","symbol":"cind","description":"The CIN in Cindrum stands for ‘consolidate in network,’ meaning a virtual world where reality is integrated. Cindrum is more than an augmented reality (AR) experience. Users, through their avatars, can express what they could in real life and even more in a virtual social networking environment. The virtual space of Cindrum will be closer to “another reality” for users. ​Overcoming the physical boundaries and limitations of reality, CINDRUM as a new paradigm is going to connotate a pioneer that brings a new wave of metaverse technology.","links":"https://www.cindrum.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cindrum/logo.png"}
