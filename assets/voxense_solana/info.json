{"name":"Voxense","id":"voxense_solana","symbol":"vox","description":"VOXENSE is a Spatial DePIN network that turns real-world sensor activity such as GPS, motion, ambient signals, and audio fingerprints into cryptographic Proof-of-Sensing on Solana. Instead of uploading raw data, devices generate local hashed and signed fingerprints, allowing the network to verify real environmental conditions without exposing personal information. VOXENSE enables a new Scan-to-Earn economy, where everyday devices can act as sensing nodes, earn rewards, and contribute to a decentralized reality layer. This verified sensor data powers applications in AI, robotics, spatial computing, and the upcoming VOXENSE mobile app and marketplace.","links":"https://www.voxense.network/","market_cap":3541.97,"market_cap_rank":12786,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/voxense_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"9ruvAhSYeRXqqAz1ffWyKzvPk4SJdLgtMWLXfz5Ppump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/9ruvAhSYeRXqqAz1ffWyKzvPk4SJdLgtMWLXfz5Ppump"}},"is_native":false}
