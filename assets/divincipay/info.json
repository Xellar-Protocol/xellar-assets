{"name":"DiVinciPay","id":"divincipay","symbol":"dvnci","description":"DiVinciPay is a non-custodial plugin designed specifically for WIX & Wordpress websites. Why do we spell DiVinciPay with a \"Di\" instead of \"Da\"? \"Di\" stands for \"Dependency Injection\", which is a programming technique used for the reusability of code to achieve speed, stability and security. DiVinciPay is a powerful tool that pairs with traditional payment systems, integrating seamlessly within WIX & Wordpress websites. DiVinciPay instantly upgrades a Web2 website to a high-powered, Web3 application.
