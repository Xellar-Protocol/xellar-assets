{"name":"Nippon Lagoon","id":"nippon-lagoon","symbol":"nlc","description":"NLC will be available on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Today, BSC is one of the famous blockchains together with Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon. BSC showed a strong and growing ecosystem considering its young age. Despite being a younger blockchain, BSC had a high of 2,105,367 addresses on June 7, 2021, which was more than double Ethereumâ€™s all-time high of 799,580 addresses on May 9, 2021. Faster confirmation times and cheap costs are key factors. The rising popularity of NFTs and their interoperability with popular crypto wallets like Trust Wallet and MetaMask might be contributing to BSC development.","links":"https://nlcproject.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nippon-lagoon/logo.png"}
