{"name":"Metal Blockchain","id":"metal-blockchain","symbol":"metal","description":"Metal blockchain ($METAL) is a layer zero blockchain that allows any chain to deploy and find consensus through the Snow protocols (introduced by Avalanche) allowing it to run on a highly efficient model of Proof-of-Stake (PoS), eliminating the need for Proof-of-Work (PoW). Metal Blockchain improves upon the initial work of Avalanche by adding a fourth subchain (A Chain) to offer a more resource efficient layer for payments and decentralized finance: Proton (based on EOSIO protocol, adding WASM).","links":"https://metalblockchain.org/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/metal-blockchain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x294559fa758c88d639fd085751e463fee7806eab"}}}
