Soon you’ll be able to make an ultra-HD scan of yourself and your real-world assets and move everything into the metaverse. Metahero brings to the market 3D scanning and modeling technology that generates ultra-realistic 3D avatars and virtual items to be used across games, VR, social media, and online fashion. The tech also allows for the creation of NFTs from real-world works of art and collectibles. We have partnered with the world leader in 3D scanning: Wolf Studio. Their cutting-edge technology was extensively tested and used by big industry names; Most recently, CD Projekt created characters for their hot new release, CyberPunk 2077. We’re merging this powerful tech with a marketplace and a novel deflationary token-based ecosystem to offer users, gamers, artists, and entrepreneurs direct access to virtual opportunities of the future.
