{"name":"Opal","id":"opal-3_ethereum","symbol":"opal","description":"(OPAL) is a next-generation decentralized exchange (DEX) on Ethereum, designed to bring privacy, fairness, and revenue-sharing to perpetual trading. Using AI-driven sealed order execution, Opal ensures trades remain hidden until settlement, protecting users from front-running, predatory bots, and unfair advantages—even from the exchange itself. 100% of platform revenue is distributed to OPAL holders in ETH, establishing real token utility and passive income. With a focus on scalability, verifiable on-chain proofs, and non-custodial ownership, Opal represents a fairer, more transparent model for DeFi trading.","links":"https://opaldex.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/opal-3_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x199e2cfaf8b4f2cc5423971ef3749d1c89cf815c","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x199e2cfaf8b4f2cc5423971ef3749d1c89cf815c"}},"is_native":false}
