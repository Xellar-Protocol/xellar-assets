{"name":"EchoMetrix","id":"echometrix_ethereum","symbol":"mtx","description":"EchoMetrix is a cross-chain analytics and rewards ecosystem that transforms reputation and influence into measurable, on-chain value. By combining wallet activity and social engagement (like tweets, mentions, and trends), EchoMetrix calculates a unique EchoScore for every user — a transparent reputation metric that powers rewards, rankings, and project discovery. The platform includes tools like: MetrixRadar (real-time trend tracker), Community Share (revenue distribution to contributors), Agent AI (trend-predictive automation), and MTXPad (token launch system with a bonding-curve-based graduation model called MTXFuel). At its core, EchoMetrix helps communities track what’s real, reward what matters, and build with credibility across Ethereum and beyond — all powered by the $MTX token.","links":"https://echometrixapp.com","market_cap":7761.34,"market_cap_rank":11649,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/echometrix_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa1ecd506d5b178d7220fe175013ffa43ccad9610","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xa1ecd506d5b178d7220fe175013ffa43ccad9610"}},"is_native":false}
