{"name":"LULU Market Luck","id":"lulu-market-luck","symbol":"luck","description":"LULU Market is a community-driven, fair-launched Web 3.0 game, that aims to build a healthy and sustainable blockchain application. It supports our natural economies by bridging the metaverse and the real world. Through play-to-earn gaming and NFT minting in LULU Market, players can participate in DAO governance, stake to earn dividends, and get real goods from LULU Market. It is a farming-style gamefi filled with fascinating functions that allow players to experience the real market trading mechanism in the metaverse. In LULU Market, players can plant, collect and trade for earnings, just like our real economics. Except, we brought it into the metaverse where players can have a 100% experience of possessing, purchasing, and trading raw materials they earn in games and contribute to the ecosystem but at the same time, players can trade their materials at the in-game market or exchange for REAL physical goods. There are and will be many more functions in LULU Market. Many of them will have players trading with each other. We are creating a game scene with high interaction between players, where they can negotiate, trade, hire, and lease with each other. Others will have them complete daily tasks, grow crops, and unlock other characters.","links":"https://www.lulu.market/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/lulu-market-luck/logo.png"}
