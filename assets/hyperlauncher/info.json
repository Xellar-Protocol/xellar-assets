{"name":"Hyperlauncher","id":"hyperlauncher","symbol":"launch","description":"Hyperlauncher is building autonomous AI founders- vertical agents designed to replace or augment traditional founding teams in blockchain companies. These agents are tokenized on HyperEVM, combining decentralized ownership with operational intelligence. In a typical startup, core functions like product development, marketing, operations, and community engagement are led by human founders and teams. Hyperlauncher reimagines these roles as part of an autonomous agent network, where specialized AI agents manage these functions. The goal is to streamline processes, improve efficiency, and achieve more consistent outcomes by removing human bottlenecks and leveraging data-driven decision-making. This approach shifts the concept of blockchain startups from being team-dependent to being agent-driven, offering a new perspective on how businesses can be built and scaled in a decentralized ecosystem.","links":"https://hyperlauncher.ai/","market_cap":2223484,"market_cap_rank":2783,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/hyperlauncher/logo.png","detail_platform":{"hyperliquid":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa82aa458b2c146e97733d0c05374aa0e"}}}
