The protocol has a native token called AAVE, which is also a governance token that lets the community decide the direction of the protocol in a collective manner. Lenders can earn interest by providing liquidity to the market, while borrowers can borrow by collateralizing their cryptoassets to take out loans from the liquidity pools.","links":"https://app.aave.com/?referral=93","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/aave/logo.png"}
