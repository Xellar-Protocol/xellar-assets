{"name":"Aegis YUSD","id":"aegis-yusd_ethereum","symbol":"yusd","description":"Aegis YUSD is a decentralized, Bitcoin-backed stablecoin designed to maintain a 1:1 peg to the US dollar while generating yield for its holders. YUSD is backed 1:1 by Bitcoin reserves held in custodial vaults and secured through smart contracts. The Aegis protocol employs a delta-neutral hedging strategy, where Bitcoin-margined perpetual contracts counterbalance BTC price fluctuations. This ensures that the value of YUSD remains stable at $1, independent of market volatility.","links":"https://app.aegis.im","market_cap":44192507,"market_cap_rank":696,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/aegis-yusd/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x4274cd7277c7bb0806bd5fe84b9adae466a8da0a","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x4274cd7277c7bb0806bd5fe84b9adae466a8da0a"}},"is_native":false}
