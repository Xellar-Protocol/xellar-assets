{"name":"zkTerm","id":"zkterm_solana","symbol":"zktr","description":"zkTerm Documentation A standardized terminal for modern zero-knowledge development. Designed to unify tools, streamline workflows, and simplify the creation of ZK-powered applications across chains and proof systems. The Problem: ZK Ecosystem Fragmentation The zero-knowledge ecosystem is powerful but fragmented. There are zkSNARKs, zkSTARKs, zkVMs, zkIDs, zkBridges, zkRollups, zkOracles, zkCompression and dozens more variants. Each technology uses different tooling, separate CLIs, incompatible workflows, and scattered documentation. Developers must learn multiple frameworks, switch between tools constantly, and struggle with integration challenges. Users face confusion navigating different interfaces for each ZK primitive. The fragmentation slows adoption and makes the powerful privacy guarantees of zero-knowledge proofs harder to access. The Solution: zkTerm zkTerm unifies the entire zero-knowledge ecosystem into a single command-line interface. One terminal. One workflow. One consistent experience for every ZK technology. Whether generating SNARK proofs, executing zkVM programs, creating zkID credentials, running zkRollup operations, or compressing state with zkCompression - everything happens through the same unified zk [command] interface. No more switching tools. No more incompatible workflows. No more fragmentation. Just one powerful terminal that brings the entire zero-knowledge universe to your fingertips. What's Built Today (Phase 1-2: Solana Only) Current Scope: zkTerm is production-ready on Solana Mainnet only. The \"universal terminal\" vision (Phases 3-6) is planned but not yet implemented. Think of this as \"zkTerm for Solana\" today, with a roadmap to become \"zkTerm for Everything.\" zkID Authentication - Privacy-preserving did:zk:xxx identity with Ed25519 proofs (Solana only) zkCompression - Light Protocol backend integration, 99.9% account creation savings on Solana Solana Wallet - BIP39 seed phrases with AES-256-GCM encryption (no Zcash yet) Privacy Mode - Display-only encrypted transfers (on-chain amounts still visible) XTerm.js Terminal - CLI with SSE streaming logs (zkAI assistant in development) The Vision zkTerm will become the universal interface for all zero-knowledge technologies. From generating circuits with Circom to executing programs in zkVMs like RISC Zero and SP1, from creating cross-chain proofs with zkBridge to running zkRollup operations, from zkOracle queries to zkML inference - all unified in one terminal. The goal is to eliminate fragmentation and make zero-knowledge proofs accessible to everyone, regardless of which specific ZK technology they need to use.","links":"https://zkterm.io/","market_cap":24183,"market_cap_rank":9417,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/zkterm/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"DTanHWf8jRg4cgiMfVYReU53J9Za2mGSm9cS3cahpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/DTanHWf8jRg4cgiMfVYReU53J9Za2mGSm9cS3cahpump"}},"is_native":false}
