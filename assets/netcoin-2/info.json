{"name":"Netcoin","id":"netcoin-2","symbol":"net","description":"Thanks to Anonymousspeech.org data dump in 2022, Bitcoin researches and sleuth have discovered that on August 17, 2008 netcoin.org was registered, a day prior to bitcoin.org, capturing the attention of the cryptocurrency community. Evidence suggests Satoshi Nakamoto may have initially considered \"Netcoin\" before launching Bitcoin. Netcoin ticker on Solana is a homage to Satoshi Nakamoto and Bitcoin lore in general. Keeping the memory alive and allowing to somewhat relive the early pioneering days of Bitcoin, through its original name: Netcoin. We are the current community takeover that has gone on for 94 days so far, with ticker having a history of almost 1 year and 4 months. Besides keeping Bitcoins lore alive through repeating the history, we are also creating a forum (Netcointalk) to match Bitcointalk. Multichain atomic swaps, P2P marketplace and a DAO are also planned into the growth of the ticker. Melding the old and the current while keeping the memory alive.","links":"https://netcoiners.org/","market_cap":142017,"market_cap_rank":6933,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/netcoin-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":5,"contract_address":"7nFYpHyhDgzg3ioU2JFko5kaVwm6bjkL4MtbUiVAiYbJ","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/7nFYpHyhDgzg3ioU2JFko5kaVwm6bjkL4MtbUiVAiYbJ"}}}
