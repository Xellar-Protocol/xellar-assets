{"name":"SWERVE Protocol","id":"swerve-protocol","symbol":"swerve","description":"The SWERVE protocol is a decentralised asset provider enabling users to access alternative non-USD stable coins through staking of collateral. The SWERVE protocol also is a decentralized on-chain liquidation engine system powering derivatives markets on trading and lending platforms on Solana. Right now, there are no major non-USD stable coins leading to a dependency on the dollar. SWERVE is enabling users to gain onchain exposure to other currencies like KRW, JPY, etc. This enables additional market pairs to enter the Serum ecosystem as a new base is introduced. The liquidation engine aspect of the protocol plays a key role in keeping a healthy Solana ecosystem. By managing liquidations and providing capital across several different derivatives and lending platforms, the overall usability and health of the platforms are substantially increased, which helps further advance the ecosystem.","links":"https://www.swervesolana.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/swerve-protocol/logo.png"}
