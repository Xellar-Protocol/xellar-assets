{"name":"MAG7.ssi","id":"mag7-ssi","symbol":"mag7.ssi","description":"The SoSoValue Index Protocol is a cutting-edge spot index solution designed to make crypto investments simple and secured. SSI Protocol leverages on-chain smart contracts to repackage multi-chain, multi-asset portfolios into Wrapped Tokens (SSI). These tokens represent a basket of underlying assets, enabling Wrapped Tokens to track the value fluctuations of the spots basket, effectively achieving the effects of passive index investing. MAG7.ssi carefully selected top 7 projects by market cap, with strong social consensus and ample liquidity. This product offers enhanced systematic beta returns from the crypto industry while providing high risk resistance. The initial 10% equal weighting allocation provides sufficient weight to second-tier leaders outside of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Assuming the emergence of more $100 billion market cap tokens over the next 4 years, this structure helps investors secure foundational returns from the crypto industry while also offering the opportunity to capture excess returns from the rise of new industry leaders. Monthly rebalance with a buffer setting ensures timely inclusion of emerging leaders while minimizing the transaction friction caused by frequent rebalancing.","links":"https://sosovalue.com/","market_cap":172592719,"market_cap_rank":361,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mag7-ssi/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"0x9e6a46f294bb67c20f1d1e7afb0bbef614403b55","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x9e6a46f294bb67c20f1d1e7afb0bbef614403b55"}}}
