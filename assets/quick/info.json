The DEX was launched in 2020 & provides DeFi features such as swaps, liquidity providing, farming, & staking. It's also home to the DragonFi ecosystem, a powerful DeFi product suite that includes a decentralized Perpetual Exchange (QuickPerps), Gaming Hub, and much more. $QUICK (OLD) is the existing version of QuickSwap's native token - a token split took place in 2022 that redenominated it to New $QUICK at a 1:1000 ratio. The Old $QUICK token does not have any utility on the DEX, so users can convert to New $QUICK via QuickSwap's converter & stake in the Dragon's Lair to earn yield, in addition to farming the token to earn rewards.","links":"https://quickswap.exchange/","market_cap":43331375,"market_cap_rank":997,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/quick/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6c28aef8977c9b773996d0e8376d2ee379446f2f"},"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x831753dd7087cac61ab5644b308642cc1c33dc13"}}}
