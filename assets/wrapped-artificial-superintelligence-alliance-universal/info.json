Fetch.ai (FET) is a decentralized machine learning network that aims to democratize access to artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Universal is a cross-chain asset protocol that enables users to trade and utilize wrapped assets (uAssets) across multiple blockchains. uAssets are 1:1 backed representations of native cryptocurrencies, such as XRP, DOGE, and SUI, held in secure custody. This allows users to access and transact with assets that are not natively available on their preferred chains, without relying on bridges or centralized exchanges. Universal provides seamless trading, liquidity provision, and lending opportunities for uAssets, ensuring deep liquidity and security through institutional-grade custody and real-time proof of reserves.","links":"https://www.universal.xyz/tokens/uFET","market_cap":527.51,"market_cap_rank":10424,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wrapped-artificial-superintelligence-alliance-universal/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xacbf16f82753f3d52a2c87e4eeda220c9a7a3762","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xacbf16f82753f3d52a2c87e4eeda220c9a7a3762"}}}
