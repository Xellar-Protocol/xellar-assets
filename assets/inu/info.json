{"name":"Inu.","id":"inu","symbol":"inu","description":"$INU is a 100% community-based and decentralized token on the ERC20 blockchain. INU's goals are to propel the crypto industry towards decentralization while providing fair market access to a decentralized economy that facilitates and encourages transactions. The contract is waived, preventing centralization. TECH: INUSWAP- This will be a decentralized swap with the following functions realized: token buying and selling, adding liquidity, pledge mining, spot pending order trading, and contract futures trading. INU DECENTRALIZED MARKETPLACE: This tech will allow users to create a decentralized storefront that can be used pseudo anonymously by simply using an ETH address. The tech will also use NFTs for receipts, order tracking, and inventory serial numbers. The NFT receipt will contain the encrypted shipping address and item inventory as well as the number of items ordered. PROJECT X: The completion of the INU DECENTRALIZED MARKETPLACE will then allow us to continue on to our top secret plans (to be revealed) of “PROJECT X”. PROJECT X will be underpinned by the idea that crypto projects that fail to create an economy in which people can transact will ultimately fail. PROJECT X will be used to make sure we are a long term project with indefinite sustainability that requires a continuous commitment to exploration.","links":"https://www.theinu.net/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/inu/logo.png"}
