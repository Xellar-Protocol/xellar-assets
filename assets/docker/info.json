{"name":"Docker","id":"docker","symbol":"dockerzxbt","description":"Docker is a Tokenized Treasury of Zora Creator Coins. Docker invests in a plethora of zora creator coins, all publicly available to see on the website. This treasury ties in directly to the $docker token, with profits made from the treasury automatically used to buyback $docker. This initiates the Docker flywheel, where trading fees made from $docker are then used to buy more creator coins.","links":"https://dockerxbt.com/","market_cap":2434027,"market_cap_rank":3092,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/docker/logo.png","detail_platform":{"zora-network":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x56f8ad6112c2db9f9848243531b277ce1c3be30c","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/zora-network/tokens/0x56f8ad6112c2db9f9848243531b277ce1c3be30c"},"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x56f8ad6112c2db9f9848243531b277ce1c3be30c","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x56f8ad6112c2db9f9848243531b277ce1c3be30c"}}}
