{"name":"Best Memecoin Ever","id":"best-memecoin-ever_solana","symbol":"cult","description":"In the high-stakes, fast-moving world of crypto—especially on platforms like Solana—emotions run high. The market is flooded with noise: hype cycles, FOMO (fear of missing out), FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt), pump-and-dumps, and meme mania. In this chaos, most people react impulsively. They chase green candles, panic on red, and act without conviction. This environment breeds instability—not just in the charts, but in the minds of the traders themselves. CULT is designed as an antidote to this chaos. It stands for something much deeper than just a token—it’s a philosophy, a mindset, and a standard. CULT represents discipline, focus, and stoic conviction in a space dominated by emotion and noise. It is a way of thinking that rejects the urge to act rashly and instead promotes self-control, strategy, and inner strength. At its core, CULT is a reminder: the ones who win are the ones who don’t flinch. In other words, victory in this game doesn’t go to the loudest or the fastest—it goes to the most focused. The ones who stay calm while others panic. The ones who think long-term while others think in 10-minute charts. The ones who know why they entered and don’t second-guess themselves at every tick up or down. One of CULT’s most direct goals is to end “jeetery” on Solana. “Jeetery” refers to the behavior of ‘jeets’—a slang term for traders who sell too early out of fear, greed, or impatience. Jeets are driven by short-term thinking and often undermine the projects and communities they’re a part of. They are, in many ways, the biggest barrier to sustainable growth in crypto ecosystems. CULT wants to put an end to this culture. Not just by calling it out—but by replacing it with something better: a standard. This standard is based on principles: conviction, commitment, and calm in the face of volatility. CULT is not just about what you hold in your wallet—it’s about what you hold in your mind. It’s a daily discipline, a refusal to bend to market emotions, and a choice to be part of something greater than quick flips. Ultimately, CULT is how you prove to yourself you’re not like the rest. It’s not about flexing or bragging—it’s about silently doing the work, sharpening your edge, and standing firm while the rest lose their grip. It’s about aligning with a higher level of thinking—because in a market full of noise, the quietest minds often win. CULT isn't for everyone. But if you're ready to elevate your mindset, it might be for you.","links":"https://bestmemecoinever.com/","market_cap":3916.05,"market_cap_rank":12688,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/best-memecoin-ever_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"93EpfRSroBwD5DmDBXkaCdLZy8nnShtrVCLMCXjxpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/93EpfRSroBwD5DmDBXkaCdLZy8nnShtrVCLMCXjxpump"}},"is_native":false}
