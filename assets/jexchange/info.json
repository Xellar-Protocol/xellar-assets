The goal is to provide a simple and intuitive platform to create tokens exchange offers by interacting with a smart contract to benefit from the high level of security of Elrond blockchain. Many new projects and their token appear almost everyday. We think it is important to provide a simple and secure way for users to exchange these tokens from peer to peer. Security is very important in these exchanges that require a third party to act as a warranty for integrity and to prevent fraud. JEX exchange claims to be a complement to the Maiar Exchange by proposing peer-to-peer swaps using a smart contract as a trustworthy third party.","links":"https://jexchange.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/jexchange/logo.png","detail_platform":{"elrond":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"erd1hmfwpvsqn8ktzw3dqd0ltpcyfyasgv8mr9w0qecnmpexyp280y8q47ca9d"}}}
