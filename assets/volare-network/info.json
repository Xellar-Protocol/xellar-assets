The Volare Network provides infrastructure to effectively manage the “use value” and “exchange value”, and to ultimately guarantee the value, of VOLR. Volare Network intends to create a constructive ecosystem that can consistently enhance the value of Volare within the network through the provision various services (“Volare Ecosystem”).","links":"https://volare.network/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/volare-network/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
