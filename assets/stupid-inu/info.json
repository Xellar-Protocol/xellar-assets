{"name":"STUPID INU","id":"stupid-inu","symbol":"stupid","description":"This is a meme coin called STUPID INU, symbol STUPID, launched 2 hours 15 minutes ago on August 12, 2025. The meme theme features a cartoonish, orange Shiba Inu dog with a dopey, half-smiling expression and red exclamation marks, evoking a \"stupid\" or clueless vibe on a yellow background. The launch followed a typical Solana meme coin pattern: starting with a migration or initial liquidity addition on Raydium (labeled \"MIGRATION LETS BONK\" in event logs), followed by rapid promotions including Dexscreener updates and boosts, Meteora pool creations, and calls from channels like MadApes, Crafty Gambles, and Maestros Gamble. Mint and freeze authorities were revoked shortly after launch, which is a positive sign for decentralization. It quickly trended on Dexscreener (reaching #3 or #4 in hourly trends), gained listings on platforms like Moontok, and saw smart money buys and high engagement on X.","links":"https://stupidinusol.xyz/","market_cap":433985,"market_cap_rank":5323,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/stupid-inu/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"w6iohhdC6zbq2DP1uwtmvXPJibbFroDnni1A222bonk","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/w6iohhdC6zbq2DP1uwtmvXPJibbFroDnni1A222bonk"}}}
