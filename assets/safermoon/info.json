{"name":"SAFERMOON","id":"safermoon","symbol":"safermoon","description":"SAFERmoon is an audited static rewards token that also lets you earn additional rewards via staking with no fees while continuing to collect reflection awards (and soon by adding liquidity). A 5% transaction fee is redistributed to existing holders, and another 5% transaction fee is used to create a SAFERMOON-BNB pair to generate liquidity on PancakeSwap. Devs have renounced all liquidity, and the contract functions are timelocked.","links":"https://safermoon.net","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/safermoon/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xa656f993bd14b2b59a28d1e610476ad18849b107"}}}
