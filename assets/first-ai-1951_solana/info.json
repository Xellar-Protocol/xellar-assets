It was the first computer to mimic brain-like learning, marking the beginning of neural network technology. This groundbreaking invention sparked revolutionary ideas about machines thinking like humans and laid the foundation for advanced AI models like ChatGPT and Grok. SNARC ignited the journey toward today’s intelligent AI systems, proving that what once seemed humanly impossible could become reality.","links":"https://x.com/i/communities/1849077301171851501","market_cap":5552.15,"market_cap_rank":12213,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/first-ai-1951_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"BD7jNnt6uYDp9rVRBTjJhkweGxYQppRe8CXLnAJspump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/BD7jNnt6uYDp9rVRBTjJhkweGxYQppRe8CXLnAJspump"}},"is_native":false}
