{"name":"Black Diamond","id":"black-diamond","symbol":"diamonds","description":"Black Diamond was started to support homeless veterans and as an answer for the demand for higher reflections among Safe tokens. Black Diamond is intended to be the safest Anti-Whale coin on the market while offering higher reflections than any other current token. Forked from a Safe token contract we have improved upon the Anti-Whale functions by cutting the max transaction amount in half. Black Diamond was created by Veteran and Active Duty U.S Servicemen. We have a charity wallet holding 1% of the total supply that will be donated to the National Coalition of Homeless Veterans when we hit predetermined milestones. 5% of profits from our Merch store also go to this cause Whitepaper: https://drive.google.com/file/d/15jY8Vetxtx1c-G0Rryv_i7aKuyRpCax0/view","links":"https://blackdiamond.gold/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/black-diamond/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":12,"contract_address":"0x37c4bcf0b8fc6f074be933af7fb9d1dde55f979c"}}}
