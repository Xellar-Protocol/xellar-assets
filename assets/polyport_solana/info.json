{"name":"PolyPort","id":"polyport_solana","symbol":"polyport","description":"PolyPort is the PumpFun of prediction markets - a fully permissionless, decentralized platform on Solana that lets anyone create a prediction market with zero upfront capital. Today’s major prediction markets are centralized and curated, limiting creativity, speed, and the true potential of the category. PolyPort flips this model by letting anyone launch a market, where both creators and liquidity providers earn fees from trading activity, creating a powerful self-incentivizing ecosystem. Liquidity has always been the biggest challenge in prediction markets, and PolyPort solves it with a breakthrough: any market can go live with just 3 SOL, and liquidity scales naturally as trading grows. Powered by a CPMM engine, the same model used by Uniswap but optimized for prediction markets, PolyPort offers instant on-chain odds, no order books, and no waiting. PolyPort's mission is simple: democratize prediction markets so anyone can create, trade, and provide liquidity.","links":"https://www.polyport.app/","market_cap":61721,"market_cap_rank":7851,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/polyport/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"2k5o37XM59vQRmnnVnJAEspqfEG9VfoFNTywH49Jpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/2k5o37XM59vQRmnnVnJAEspqfEG9VfoFNTywH49Jpump"}},"is_native":false}
