{"name":"Valhalla Index","id":"valhalla-index","symbol":"odin","description":"The Valhalla decentralized liquidity network (DLN) consists of 16 UniV2 liquidity pools with permanently locked liquidity. These burned liquidity pools present multi-legged arbitrage opportunities mediated by the ODIN token every time a paired asset moves in price, harvesting volatility as a burn mechanism for ODIN by forcing arbitrageurs to pay fees into the burned liquidity positions. The Valhalla DLN has also permanently locked a single-sided staking position in pValhalla which further reduces the circulating supply of ODIN through arbitrage activity between pTokens. Users can stake pValhalla to earn more Odin tokens.","links":"https://www.valhallaindex.com","market_cap":2518066,"market_cap_rank":3009,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/valhalla-index/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xdfc5964141c018485b4d017634660f85aa667714"}}}
