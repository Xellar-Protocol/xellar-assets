{"name":"Luckycoin","id":"luckycoin","symbol":"lky","description":"Luckycoin offers super lucky blocks where rewards can be x2, x5 and even x58. Luckycoin also has an accelerated difficulty adjustment algorithm. The difficulty will be adjusted much faster in the beginning, so if there is a high hash power jump, it will rise much faster than normal. The difficulty will be retargeted about every 4 hours.","links":"http://luckycoinfoundation.org/","market_cap":5042063,"market_cap_rank":2035,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/luckycoin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
