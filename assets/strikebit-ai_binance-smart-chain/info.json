{"name":"StrikeBit AI","id":"strikebit-ai_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"strike","description":"StrikeBit is building the Modular Agent Protocol (MAP) — a scalable framework for creating, customizing, and monetizing AI Agents. Unlike most platforms that offer generic chatbots or automation, StrikeBit enables developers to build modular, upgradeable agents that can be co-owned. What sets StrikeBit apart is its role as both a competitor and enabler in the agent space. While platforms like Virtuals focus on launching LLM-based agents, StrikeBit provides the toolkit to make those agents smarter, interoperable, and co-ownable. Our flagship services allow users to build subagents, creating layered, task-specific agent systems — a key feature of our modular design. This positions StrikeBit as the foundation for scalable, intelligent agent ecosystems.","links":"https://www.strikebit.io/","market_cap":1523546,"market_cap_rank":3251,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/strikebit-ai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x2aa89a0113bcbbcdc5812c6df794e2d9650fc1af","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x2aa89a0113bcbbcdc5812c6df794e2d9650fc1af"}},"is_native":false}
