{"name":"Definet","id":"definet","symbol":"net","description":"What is the project about? Assisting DeFi space users through novel paths with unique and innovative tools What makes your project unique? DefiNet was created to assist DeFi users in every way possible through innovative tools with the goal of allowing these users to analyze the DeFi market from perspectives they never imagined, providing them with new value data to improve their performance. History of your project. Definet has been developed since mid 2022, making sure that the launchpad works the right way. At this time, many of our team members have left but as well others joined, with the enough experience in crypto to make this project successful. Whatâ€™s next for your project? The Definet dApp will be at the centre of a complete ecosystem, in which holders of the token will both get access to a variety of useful tools AND get a direct share in the ecosystem's profits. The current focus of the dApp revolves around volume indicators, which is a great place to start when you are evaluating the current market conditions. However, there's always more than volume to a good or bad day/project. We will keep expanding our dApp and the information it provides in frequent, ongoing updates in our aim to become the most used dApp for a quick, realtime overview of the quality of the current markets. What can your token be used for? Our token gives access to our products and to become an early bird to our launchpad.","links":"https://www.definet-platform.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/definet/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x77a9b858aa8417fd318ecee01c1d6d9fef31a71f"}}}
