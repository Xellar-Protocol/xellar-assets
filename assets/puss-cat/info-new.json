{"name":"Puss Cat","id":"puss-cat","symbol":"puca","description":"$PUCA is a token that derives its value from internet, memes, trends, or jokes. Unlike traditional cryptocurriences like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are often backed by technology or utility, $PUCA is drived by community interest and sentiment. Itâ€™s created as a playful experiment to engage with the Solana community that are more cat-persons. It can be highly volatile and is used for speculative trading rather than as a serious investment.","links":"https://pusscatcoin.com/index.html","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/puss-cat/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"3rWUivXsgzqmgijmShk2bsRTHBaWSLe4CQaY2xsP8hQ9"}}}
