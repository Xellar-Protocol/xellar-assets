{"name":"Milk Money","id":"milk-money_solana","symbol":"mm","description":"Milk Money token functions as a liquidity engine designed to support emerging and high-potential projects. Unlike passive meme coins or static stores of value, it is actively deployed into Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker (DLMM) strategies through a proprietary, custom-built bot. Treasury capital is strategically allocated across DLMM pools selected for their strong fundamentals, rapidly growing communities, early-stage potential with asymmetric upside, and opportunities to capture sustainable trading fees. Deployment is managed through a set of proven strategies, including gap fill for complete price coverage with minimal inefficiency, one-sided provision for DCA-style directional exposure, market cap and price range positioning for capital-efficient alignment with project growth phases, and trailing stop with risk management for automated rebalancing and exit conditions. By adapting dynamically to evolving market conditions, these strategies ensure that the treasury remains efficient, growth-oriented, and protected against downside risk.","links":"https://jup.ag/studio/Ax8PSfCXxmxb8C8kYTzN5CPpTe6PyeZfFf8rrXNCjupx","market_cap":283134,"market_cap_rank":5402,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/milk-money/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"Ax8PSfCXxmxb8C8kYTzN5CPpTe6PyeZfFf8rrXNCjupx","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/Ax8PSfCXxmxb8C8kYTzN5CPpTe6PyeZfFf8rrXNCjupx"}},"is_native":false}
