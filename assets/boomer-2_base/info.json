{"name":"Boomer","id":"boomer-2_base","symbol":"boomer","description":"Boomer Where the lawn is trimmed, the beer is cold, and the thermostat stays exactly where I set it. He's not here for your hashtags, your TikToks, or your oat milk lattes. He’s got cargo shorts with more storage than your iCloud, sandals that never go out of style, and enough opinions to fill a podcast nobody asked for. He lives in the smoke of backyard BBQs, the smell of gasoline in garage workshops, and the pride of saying “we got by just fine without smartphones.” He embodies the ultimate dad energy — unsolicited life advice, outdated hot takes, and the unshakable belief that experience beats everything, even when he's dead wrong. Tokenomics Ticker: $BOOMER Total Supply: 1 Billion No Tax Dad energy isn’t about age — it’s a mindset. The minute you say “this music is just noise,” Boomer Wojak is already within you.","links":"https://boomertoken.xyz/","market_cap":118383,"market_cap_rank":6718,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/boomer-2_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x9495729f1ec6d9c919eb6ad10ae8a26a4f7e15d7","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x9495729f1ec6d9c919eb6ad10ae8a26a4f7e15d7"}},"is_native":false}
