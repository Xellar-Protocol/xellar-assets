{"name":"Timeworx","id":"timeworx","symbol":"tix","description":"Timeworx.io is the Data Processing Layer for next gen AI, focused on a mission to revolutionize data processing by combining decentralization, AI, and human intelligence to deliver scalable, efficient and transparent solutions. Timeworx.io enables companies to process their data using a diversified workforce of agents, whether human or AI, incentivized through Blockchain technologies. The approach is **trustless**: no agent is considered trusted, whether human or AI. All data processing outcomes need to be deemed correct only through **consensus** achieved using the decentralized data processing protocol. The platform employs robust quality control mechanisms as on-chain proofs of performance for all data processing agents. Constant performance validation, regular audits, and feedback loops ensure that the processed data is of the highest quality. At Timeworx.io, the focus is on decentralizing the system to create a financial model where prices are dictated by the market, not by the platform. The model reflects open market dynamics aligned with the principles of Web3, supporting both the clients and the agents who contribute to the platform: - **Dynamic**: the pricing model empowers companies (task creators) and agents (task completers) through a flexible and responsive pricing mechanism. - **Competitive**: the platform provides a recommended price for each task, based on a comprehensive analysis of current supply (availability of agents), demand (volume of tasks needing processing), task complexity, and prevailing market conditions. - **Fair**: the goal is to ensure that the price recommendation is not only competitive but also reflects the true value of the work required, adhering to the principle of an open market. - **Flexible**: agents, in turn, can choose to process tasks based on the offered price, complexity, and their personal preferences or expertise. - **Balanced**: by continuously monitoring and adjusting to fluctuations in supply and demand, Timeworx.io ensures that task pricing remains fair, competitive, and aligned with the overarching principles of Web3 Timeworx.io is setting a **new standard for the gig economy** in the digital age by facilitating a truly decentralized and market-driven approach to task pricing and completion.","links":"https://timeworx.io","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/timeworx/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8459ab8d6aa488716c568896c0502c0af0eb6983","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x8459ab8d6aa488716c568896c0502c0af0eb6983"}}}
