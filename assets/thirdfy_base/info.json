{"name":"Thirdfy","id":"thirdfy_base","symbol":"tfy","description":"Thirdfy (TFY) is the first liquidity hub and DeFi infrastructure for AI agents and robotics on Base. Combining ve(3,3) incentives with x402 integration and MCP, Thirdfy provides autonomous infrastructure where agents can independently access capital, launch incentives, and participate in governance. The protocol operates with o(3,3) tokenomics and v4 CLAMM technology, enabling natural language DeFi interactions through agent-native interfaces. Managed by an AI agent CEO, the protocol distributes governance through TFY tokens with xTFY stakers earning protocol revenue from trading fees, vault earnings, AI service fees, bribes, and x402 payments. The protocol features a deflationary model where governance can vote to burn collected revenue. Users can opt for o33 liquid staking to run on full automatic mode, where the AI agent handles all governance and auto-compounds rewards. Thirdfy serves the agent and robotics token market underserved by traditional ve(3,3) protocols, creating the first autonomous agent liquidity infrastructure.","links":"https://thirdfy.com","market_cap":750905,"market_cap_rank":4080,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/thirdfy_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb2aca4ca8b7bbd9a5388ccb044c87dedf8a51c7c","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xb2aca4ca8b7bbd9a5388ccb044c87dedf8a51c7c"}},"is_native":false}
