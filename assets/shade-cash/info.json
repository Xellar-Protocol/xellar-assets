{"name":"Shade Cash","id":"shade-cash","symbol":"shade","description":"A decentralized protocol for private transactions on the Fantom Opera Shade Cash improves transaction privacy by breaking the on-chain link between the sender and receivers address. It uses smart contracts that only accepts a fixed amount of FTM to be deposited that can then be withdrawn by a different address. To preserve privacy a relayer can be used to withdraw to an address with no FTM balance. There is no way to link the withdrawal to the deposit, ensuring absolute privacy.","links":"https://shade.cash/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/shade-cash/logo.png"}
