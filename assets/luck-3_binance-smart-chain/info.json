{"name":"Luckify","id":"luck-3_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"luck","description":"Luckify is a decentralized gaming infrastructure protocol designed to deliver verifiable on-chain randomness for gaming and digital asset applications. It addresses the lack of transparency in traditional random number generation by combining Chainlink’s Verifiable Random Function (VRF) with price-based entropy from the LUCK/BNB pair. This hybrid approach creates a tamper-resistant, auditable randomness engine anchored to on-chain data. Luckify’s smart contracts request random numbers through Chainlink VRF, with results returned alongside cryptographic proofs. These results can be further modified using token price data, enhancing entropy while maintaining transparency. All processes occur on-chain, allowing public verification of outcomes. The protocol’s roadmap includes multiple phases. The initial version applies Chainlink VRF with token-based entropy. Future versions plan to introduce community-based randomness supported by staked LUCK tokens and evolve into a mesh network of randomness nodes governed by a DAO. The native LUCK token supports fee payments, staking, validation of randomness, and governance participation. Its fixed supply is allocated across growth initiatives, ecosystem rewards, and reserves, with vesting schedules designed to encourage long-term participation. Use cases for Luckify include provably fair casino games, PvP games with random outcomes, loot boxes, NFT mint randomness, prize draws, and integrations through SDKs and APIs. By enabling transparent and verifiable randomness, Luckify aims to support fairer and more secure digital ecosystems.","links":"https://www.luckify.co","market_cap":7957986,"market_cap_rank":1737,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/luck-3_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x5bc247a5fc7dc148b682787c58f6f764ce27581b","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x5bc247a5fc7dc148b682787c58f6f764ce27581b"}},"is_native":false}
