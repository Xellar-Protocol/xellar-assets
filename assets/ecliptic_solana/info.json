{"name":"Ecliptic","id":"ecliptic_solana","symbol":"ecliptic","description":"Ecliptic is a high-performance decentralized perpetuals exchange built as a custom zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup on Solana. The project focuses on enabling ultra-fast, low-cost trading while maintaining full verifiability of every core system action. All operations—such as order execution, order cancellation, funding calculations, and liquidations—are proven using ZK proofs and verified directly on Solana. This design allows users to trade with the speed and efficiency typical of high-frequency market infrastructure while retaining the security and transparency of on-chain settlement. Ecliptic aims to provide a trust-minimized environment in which all state transitions are publicly auditable, bridging the gap between centralized-exchange performance and decentralized-exchange integrity.","links":"https://ecliptic-perps.com","market_cap":4081.33,"market_cap_rank":12627,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ecliptic/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"68dLqMSU3bkooGwH5J244aoXXwTgFohwVnWUeEApump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/68dLqMSU3bkooGwH5J244aoXXwTgFohwVnWUeEApump"}},"is_native":false}
