{"name":"Enviro","id":"enviro","symbol":"enviro","description":"Bitcoin and other proof-of-work cryptocurrencies require large amounts of energy, due to the computations needed for mining.

It's time to use the blockchain for good.","links":"https://envirobep.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/enviro/logo.png"}
