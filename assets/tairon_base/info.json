It provides developers with a unified way to discover, test, and integrate Model Context Protocol (MCP) compatible servers across Web3 and traditional applications. Tairon solves connectivity for LLMs, securely exposing blockchain data to intelligent systems. - For developers, it removes manually integrating protocol endpoints. - For LLMs and autonomous systems, it provides a machine-readable map of callable functionality across the decentralized stack. - For protocols, it ensures their data and tooling can be easily exposed, tested, and consumed by the next generation of applications. Tairon standardizes MCP servers for AI. The result is a unified, verifiable, and interoperable data fabric that brings every on-chain data source into the reach of intelligence.","links":"https://tairon.ai","market_cap":21228,"market_cap_rank":9669,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/tairon_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x9d5c1c400dc828a3409f9c209b83ff51a65d2a0e","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x9d5c1c400dc828a3409f9c209b83ff51a65d2a0e"}},"is_native":false}
