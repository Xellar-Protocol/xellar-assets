{"name":"GNOME","id":"gnome","symbol":"$gnome","description":"We believe you should own your own genome, the DNA blueprint of what makes you who you are, so we built GenomesDAO. GenomesDAO is a private and secure DNA data bank that puts you back in control of your genome utilising AMD SVS-ES Vault and blockchain technology. By addressing privacy, security and ownership concerns of DNA testing and sharing, we are building the worldâ€™s largest user-owned genomic data bank to secure the future of personalised medicine. $GNOME is the GenomesDAO governance token. Holders can influence decisions concerning the project such as proposing or deciding on new feature proposals and even changing the governance system itself.","links":"https://genomes.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gnome/logo.png"}
