GenomesDAO is a private and secure DNA data bank that puts you back in control of your genome utilising AMD SVS-ES Vault and blockchain technology. By addressing privacy, security and ownership concerns of DNA testing and sharing, we are building the worldâ€™s largest user-owned genomic data bank to secure the future of personalised medicine. $GNOME is the GenomesDAO governance token. Holders can influence decisions concerning the project such as proposing or deciding on new feature proposals and even changing the governance system itself.","links":"https://genomes.io","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gnome/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6e8a8726639d12935b3219892155520bdc57366b"},"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x7698ac5d15bb3ba7185adcbff32a80ebd9d0709b"}}}
