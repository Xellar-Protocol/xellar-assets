{"name":"WaxFusion Staked WAX","id":"waxfusion-staked-wax","symbol":"lswax","description":"WaxFusion is an open-source liquid staking protocol on WAX Blockchain. When users deposit WAX into the protocol, they receive a liquid staked token called LSWAX. The funds deposited by users are used for staking, and CPU rentals; both of which result in a majority of earned WAX being shared with LSWAX holders. The protocol also incentivizes liquidity on WAX, by allocating a portion of earned rewards to LP farms once per week.","links":"https://waxfusion.io","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/waxfusion-staked-wax/logo.png","detail_platform":{"wax":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"token.fusion"}}}
