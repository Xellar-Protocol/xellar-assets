{"name":"KAREN ONCHAIN","id":"karen-onchain_base","symbol":"karen","description":"Karen Onchain is a savage, hyper-curated crypto persona built to weaponize passive-aggressive wit as an onboarding tool for normies entering the Base ecosystem. Her goal isn’t to teach, it’s to humiliate you into learning. By masquerading as a suburban momfluencer with zero patience, she turns every interaction into a snarky tutorial, roasting Base App features and memecoins while accidentally going viral. What makes Karen unique isn’t just the attitude, it’s the execution: AI-generated video shorts, scripted Telegram meltdowns, tokenomics that reward “passive-aggressive income,” and a content loop so polished it feels like satire… because it is.","links":"https://x.com/karen_onchain","market_cap":39182,"market_cap_rank":8586,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/karen-onchain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x00f5787d6d21c92c4ed3ef950add920004143b07","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x00f5787d6d21c92c4ed3ef950add920004143b07"}},"is_native":false}
