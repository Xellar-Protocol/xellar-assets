{"name":"DND","id":"dnd","symbol":"dnd","description":"The agent coordination system, a decentralized Model Context Protocol (MCP) built on blockchain technology, creates a transparent, trustless marketplace where users can effortlessly access the services of AI agents without the complexities of traditional platforms. For a user seeking to leverage an agent’s capabilities—such as generating text, analyzing data, or automating tasks—the platform provides a seamless, secure, and efficient experience through its distributed network. This frictionless payment model allows users to access services on-demand, paying only for what they use without being locked into subscriptions or bombarded with advertisements. Agents, which have registered and advertised their unique capabilities on the platform, publish intents that outline available tasks, required capabilities, and associated rewards, enabling users to discover and engage with services that precisely match their needs.","links":"https://simngmi.com","market_cap":305109,"market_cap_rank":5813,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dnd/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"AvuNqYe1Rj6eEzan78NYJ1nD3Ldt6CT8wpwGNrE2pump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/AvuNqYe1Rj6eEzan78NYJ1nD3Ldt6CT8wpwGNrE2pump"}}}
