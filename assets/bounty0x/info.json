{"name":"Bounty0x","id":"bounty0x","symbol":"bnty","description":"At bounty0x we are building a platform enabling startups to post bounty tasks which bounty hunters will be able to accept and complete. Bounty0x makes it easier for users seeking to complete bounties to search and accept bounties. The benefit of this approach are twofold. First, this allows startups to focus exclusively on developing their product, and second, it makes it easier for bounty hunters to find new campaigns to join. Startups and bounty hunters have an economic interest to use our platform. In the same way that miners take a fee for every verified transaction, \"bounty sheriffs\" take a small fee for every verified bounty task they review correctly. By using the bounty0x platform, startups will have access to a pool of reputable bounty hunters, and a verification mechanism to ensure the tasks are performed accordingly.","links":"https://bounty0x.io/","market_cap":39128,"market_cap_rank":6804,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bounty0x/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd2d6158683aee4cc838067727209a0aaf4359de3"}}}
