{"name":"Spectre","id":"spectre-2","symbol":"spctr","description":"Spectre – The Coin of Power. Spectre is a cryptocurrency project designed to embody the unseen forces of power that influence and shape global politics. Spectre was launched to empower individuals that have been marginalized by traditional political systems. Spectre offers a solution. Spectre unites those who are tired of seeing power concentrated in the hands of a few. Spectre is a symbol of power and transformation and operates behind the scenes, controlling the outcomes as opposed to merely participating in them. Spectre thrives on the unpredictability of elections, political discourse, and social movements. Spectre is the shadow pulling the strings, creating an opportunity for the people. At its core, Spectre is powered by a diverse community and provides a platform where its users can harness the chaos of political landscapes, turning every political moment into fuel for the coin, and an opportunity for all users. Spectre thrives worldwide without any political, governmental, institutional, or ideological limitations. Whether it is in the USA, Europe, or beyond, Spectre aligns itself with the idea that power is the only constant in a shifting political world. Spectre’s decentralized framework allows users to participate in global discourse, engage in political commentary, and shape narratives without been tied to one political brand. Instead, Spectre capitalizes on the broader movements and fluctuations that arise from political unrest. One of the primary use cases of Spectre is its role in amplifying political commentary through community engagement. Spectre is an alliance of everyday people, influencers, activists, and those disillusioned with the current systems of governance. Spectre brings them all together under a common purpose: to create real change. During election seasons, Spectre’s platform feeds off the turmoil and chaos inherent in political battles, transforming every crisis into an opportunity for the broader community to grow stronger with each new challenge. Spectre doesn’t choose sides; it profits from the entire political landscape, benefiting from every twist and turn, regardless of the “victor”. Despite its shadowy nature, Spectre is a force for good. It seeks to return power to the people, to those who have been left behind by traditional systems of control. Designed to be untouchable and resilient, Spectre is guided by the forces that have shaped history, but it uses that power to create a more just, and equitable future.","links":"https://spectre.quest","market_cap":38404,"market_cap_rank":6950,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/spectre-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xb29e475b69f843046a757747943c00dce8a3d982"}}}
