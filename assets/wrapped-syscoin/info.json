{"name":"Wrapped Syscoin","id":"wrapped-syscoin","symbol":"wsys","description":"This is a wrapped version of Syscoin to be traded on all non-native Dexes. Syscoin is a long established crypto-currency that has been in circulation since 2014. It is a dual-chain, with a 90% core compliant Bitcoin fork running along side our NEVM, which is a full Geth node EVM. Both sides are merge-mined with Bitcoin's PoW for security and we implement chain-locks on our Masternode layer to fully inherit this security and add finality ~15sec after each block. This design is deliberate so as to be the base layer for the oncoming ZKP evolution. Syscoin is a rollup-centric modular chain where all scalability will happen on it's upper layers and the base will be used for settlement.","links":"https://syscoin.org/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wrapped-syscoin/logo.png"}
