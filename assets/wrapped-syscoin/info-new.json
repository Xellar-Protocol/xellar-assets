{"name":"Wrapped Syscoin","id":"wrapped-syscoin","symbol":"wsys","description":"This is a wrapped version of Syscoin to be traded on all non-native Dexes. Syscoin is a long established crypto-currency that has been in circulation since 2014. It is a dual-chain, with a 90% core compliant Bitcoin fork running along side our NEVM, which is a full Geth node EVM. Both sides are merge-mined with Bitcoin's PoW for security and we implement chain-locks on our Masternode layer to fully inherit this security and add finality ~15sec after each block. This design is deliberate so as to be the base layer for the oncoming ZKP evolution. Syscoin is a rollup-centric modular chain where all scalability will happen on it's upper layers and the base will be used for settlement.","links":"https://syscoin.org/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wrapped-syscoin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x747b1223b23e53070c54df355fac2e198aa54708"},"energi":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x2a7ed4a3e15f036d86a28271bee580d8682a1eea"},"rollux":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006"},"syscoin":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd3e822f3ef011ca5f17d82c956d952d8d7c3a1bb"}}}
