{"name":"USP Yield Optimized Stablecoin","id":"usp-yield-optimized-stablecoin_ethereum","symbol":"usp","description":"The Piku ecosystem encompasses essential components required to cultivate the ideal yield-optimized stablecoin, ranging from transparent yield backings to a DAO led decision-making process. Below is an introductory overview of Piku's products. The USP token is classified as a yield-optimized stablecoin that uniquely combines the stability of a traditional stablecoin with the growth potential of yield-generating assets. Governed by PikuDAO, USP is initially fully backed by USD Stables at 1:1 ratio, ensuring a stable launch value of $1.00 USD. PikuDAO then diversifies and enhances this backing with a carefully selected basket of on-chain and off-chain assets that generate yield. As these additional assets contribute yield, they inherently increase the underlying value of USP, increasing its value beyond the initial peg while reflecting the generated yield directly within the token's value. USP is a savings tool with a simple access.","links":"https://www.piku.co/","market_cap":5463623,"market_cap_rank":1995,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/usp-yield-optimized-stablecoin_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x098697ba3fee4ea76294c5d6a466a4e3b3e95fe6","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x098697ba3fee4ea76294c5d6a466a4e3b3e95fe6"}},"is_native":false}
