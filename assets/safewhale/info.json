The protocol is carefully designed to ⁃ automatically grow and lock sustainable liquidity for the AMM ⁃ reward passive holders ⁃ reward active users with farming and play-to-earn (P2E) GameFi ⁃ exponentially reduce available supply (burn address deep hole) ⁃ create an ever rising price floor ⁃ generate sufficient token reserve for farming and gaming while remaining inflation neutral ⁃ support both BEP-20 and BEP-721 farming ⁃ offer real use cases for NFT holders (e.g. enter games at a discount or earn more rewards)","links":"https://safewhale.games/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/safewhale/logo.png"}
