{"name":"Reserve","id":"reserve-2","symbol":"rsrv","description":"$RSRV is a cryptocurrency that acts as the central fuel of the Reserve ecosystem, a digital environment focused on managing economic transactions and currency reserves in a sustainable way. Users can buy \"banks\" or digital wallets, each with different costs and reward rates (APR). The money used to purchase these banks is burned or removed from circulation, helping manage the currency's value. The system operates in four phases to react to market changes and ensure stability. For instance, more $RSRV is created (printed) or less is created based on the currency's value, helping manage economic balance. When the market is tough, the system has protective measures like halting currency creation or initiating a 'Monetary Reset' to maintain stability and confidence in the $RSRV currency. Different types of banks (Retail, Commercial, Investment) allow for diverse investment levels and rewards, ensuring a wide array of participation and investment in the $RSRV ecosystem.","links":"https://www.reserveth.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/reserve-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xcc2d17dfa245dc2aa3705fc75d2f7df3fe6440c7"}}}
