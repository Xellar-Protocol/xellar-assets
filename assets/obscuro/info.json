{"name":"Obscuro","id":"obscuro","symbol":"obx","description":"What is the project about? Obscuro is a layer 2 on Ethereum. It's like Arbitrum and Optimism in that it massively scales Ethereum, yet uniquely Obscuro is also encrypted. This allows for smart contracts to have both private and public states. What makes your project unique? - We're the only encrypted layer 2 platform for Ethereum. - We've added encryption without disrupting the user or developer experience. Both are 100% identical to that of Ethereum. History of your project. Our whitepaper was published in November 2021 and then work began in earnest to develop the platform. We successfully raised two funding rounds for the project and built a solid team. Whatâ€™s next for your project? Right now we're focused on launching testnet. We hope to have it live by the end of August and then we'll begin to work towards a mainnet launch by the end of the year or early 2024. What can your token be used for? Given we're a layer 2, Ether will be used for gas. OBX will act as a governance token and be used for staking. Additionally, value add services such as more performant RPC services and access to institutional-grade dashboards will need to be paid for in OBX. Further down the line, we may introduce a dual gas model if it makes sense.","links":"https://www.obscu.ro","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/obscuro/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
