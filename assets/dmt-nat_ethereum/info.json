{"name":"DMT-NAT","id":"dmt-nat_ethereum","symbol":"nat","description":"$NAT is a Bitcoin-native token derived directly from Bitcoin’s block data, making it inseparable from the network itself. Launched through a fair mint with no pre-mines or insider allocations, it aligns with Bitcoin’s ethos of openness and decentralization. Today, $NAT is earned by Bitcoin miners as a second subsidy alongside block rewards, creating an additional incentive layer designed to strengthen Bitcoin’s long-term sustainability and security budget. By embedding value creation into the chain, $NAT reframes the question: how much is Bitcoin’s security worth?","links":"https://natgmi.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dmt-nat_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":0,"contract_address":"0x249130f5e2dd4cf278180c0df8273f3592ad1247","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x249130f5e2dd4cf278180c0df8273f3592ad1247"}},"is_native":false}
