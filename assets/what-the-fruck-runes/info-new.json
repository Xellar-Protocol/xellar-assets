{"name":"WHAT•THE•FRUCK (Runes)","id":"what-the-fruck-runes","symbol":"wtf","description":"FrucksBTC is an Ordinals project launched on May 29th, 2024. The project aimed to enter the ordinal realm with its unique character silhouette and nonchalant marketing attitude. The project has now traded over 80 BTC worth of volume and recently launched a Rune called $WTF, WHAT•THE•FRUCK. WHAT•THE•FRUCK was distributed through a bespoke social game that included an interactive social media system along with a custom made mini game on the Frucks website. Users were able to earn $WTF token allocation by being active on social media and playing a quick minigame daily. Post launch, the project is leaning into being one of the many Runes ecosystem ambassadors and doing everything to make that a reality.","links":"https://fruck.it/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/what-the-fruck-runes/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ordinals":{"decimal_place":0,"contract_address":"845116:449"}}}
