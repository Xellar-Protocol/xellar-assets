{"name":"0xShadow","id":"0xshadow_ethereum","symbol":"0xs","description":"0xShadow was conceived as a modular suite of advanced privacy tools built for the decentralized web. The mission was clear from the start: give users complete control over their digital identity through tools that enable anonymity, burner credentials, and secure interaction. While the public remained unaware, we worked in silence—designing the brand, planning the roadmap, and building each tool with precision. Every step was calculated to ensure a seamless, stealth-first experience. From day one, 0xShadow set out to redefine what online privacy means in a Web3 world.","links":"https://0xshadow.online/","market_cap":36397,"market_cap_rank":8699,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/0xshadow_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x6748cde4ebabdba761e67172415d72b499d1d75b","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x6748cde4ebabdba761e67172415d72b499d1d75b"}},"is_native":false}
