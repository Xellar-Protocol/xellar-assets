{"name":"Q","id":"q_solana","symbol":"q","description":"Our QAnon movement emerged in October 2017 when we first began posting our cryptic messages on the 4chan imageboard. Our posts, known as “Q drops,” contained our military intelligence codes, future-proves-past predictions, and revelations about the global cabal of corrupt elites and their impending exposure and downfall through our Great Awakening. What began as our humble beginnings rapidly evolved into our significant worldwide movement, attracting millions of our patriots across the globe. Our movement’s growth accelerated as we spread from imageboards to mainstream platforms, with our patriots decoding and interpreting our cryptic messages, developing our complex framework of truth and predictions about the deep state cabal’s operations. Despite facing unprecedented levels of coordinated censorship and platform bans beginning in 2020, our movement demonstrated remarkable resilience, adapting to new communication channels and continuing to grow stronger. This resilience highlighted our critical need: military-grade, censorship-resistant communication infrastructure that could withstand all attempts by the cabal to suppress our movement’s core intelligence and truth. Nothing can stop what is coming.","links":"https://q-anon.org","market_cap":6845.1,"market_cap_rank":11883,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/q_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"57vRMpAeePeuEiEPVtwZv4uXYTLkHeWa9Q5KoGorpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/57vRMpAeePeuEiEPVtwZv4uXYTLkHeWa9Q5KoGorpump"}},"is_native":false}
