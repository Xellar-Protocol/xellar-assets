{"name":"$SKITTEN","id":"skitten","symbol":"skitten","description":"SKITTEN is ultimately for saving and/or rescuing kittens from euthanasia by bridging legacy business with crypto. Our goal by 2027 is to save 10,000 kittens per year from euthanasia by funding kitten adoptions for members and non-members of our token. It turns out, about a million kittens are euthanized annually because we don't have the facilities or financial means to secure them loving, forever homes. SKITTEN believes this is insane and wishes to use the power of the community to mitigate this fact. SKITTEN LLC has been formed to facilitate legacy businesses that sell products via legacy means -- online markets, etc. The provides from these businesses are used to buy and burn SKITTEN tokens.","links":"http://www.shopskitten.com","market_cap":785325,"market_cap_rank":4519,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/skitten/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x4b6104755afb5da4581b81c552da3a25608c73b8","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x4b6104755afb5da4581b81c552da3a25608c73b8"}}}
