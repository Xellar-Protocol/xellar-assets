CRE8’s mission is to empower service-based industries through secure, scalable tokenization, unlocking liquidity and global reach for service providers by turning their time and skills into digital assets. The core belief at CRE8 is that the future of work is decentralized and on-chain, enabling trustless transactions, instant payments, and borderless access to opportunities.","links":"https://cre8finance.app/","market_cap":11846.76,"market_cap_rank":10676,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cre8/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"FgGykoPuNBE24GNj7JaMTZmiBzgb25sQUvhcnRPLpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/FgGykoPuNBE24GNj7JaMTZmiBzgb25sQUvhcnRPLpump"}}}
