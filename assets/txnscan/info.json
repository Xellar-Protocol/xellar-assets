{"name":"TXNScan","id":"txnscan","symbol":"txn","description":"As blockchain technology matures, the sheer volume and complexity of on-chain data continue to expand at breakneck speed. Traditional explorers, while indispensable tools for early adopters and developers, often present information in raw technical formats that are inaccessible to the average user. A typical blockchain transaction can be a labyrinth of hexadecimal input data, multiple token transfers, contract calls, and opaque technical indicators. This complexity discourages newcomers, forces professionals to waste time on manual interpretation, and restricts the blockchain’s full potential to a narrow, highly technical audience. TXNScan seeks to change this dynamic by placing advanced artificial intelligence (AI), intuitive interfaces, and intelligent narratives at the core of blockchain exploration. Rather than forcing users to decode complex contract interactions by themselves, TXNScan interprets data, offering clear human-readable explanations, contextual insights, and interactive visual representations. It transforms raw blockchain data into comprehensible stories and actionable intelligence, making the technology accessible to everyone—from curious newcomers to veteran developers and institutional analysts.","links":"https://txnscan.com/","market_cap":10355.55,"market_cap_rank":10843,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/txnscan/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x247e3866f743cce280433b865a669c9361421ecc","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x247e3866f743cce280433b865a669c9361421ecc"}}}
