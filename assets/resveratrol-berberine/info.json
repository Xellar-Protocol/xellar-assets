{"name":"Resveratrol & Berberine","id":"resveratrol-berberine","symbol":"trol","description":"$TROL is a cryptoasset designed to fund real-world longevity research and supplement development. The project focuses on the combined potential of two well-known compounds, Resveratrol and Berberine, to promote healthspan and possibly extend human lifespan. Resveratrol, a compound found in red grapes and red wine, is commonly referred to as the “longevity molecule.” It has been studied for its potential role in cellular repair, anti-inflammatory processes, and age-related decline. Berberine, extracted from plants such as barberries, is known for its ability to support metabolic function, including blood sugar regulation and lipid metabolism. Both compounds are widely sold as over-the-counter supplements, with limited human trials confirming their long-term efficacy. $TROL aims to address this research gap by directing crypto trading fees toward controlled scientific studies. The experiments are conducted via Pump Science, a decentralized platform that enables rapid fundraising, streaming of live experiments, and acceleration of supplement trials in both animals and humans.","links":"https://pump.science/experiments/TROL","market_cap":139323,"market_cap_rank":6963,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/resveratrol-berberine/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"FDXJWqqhdrKh6TmpVKGVmHk9qyLrizzVfYd6SB7drug","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/FDXJWqqhdrKh6TmpVKGVmHk9qyLrizzVfYd6SB7drug"}}}
