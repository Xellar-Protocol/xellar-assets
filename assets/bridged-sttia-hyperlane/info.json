{"name":"Bridged stTIA (Hyperlane)","id":"bridged-sttia-hyperlane","symbol":"sttia","description":"Stride is a multichain liquid staking appchain for Celestia and the Cosmos Ecosystem. Stride allows users to stake any IBC-compatible tokens, and receive stTokens in return, which are redeemable for the original token. By staking their tokens using Stride, users will be able to earn staking rewards, while also retaining liquidity in the form of stTokens, which will allow them to take advantage of DeFi and pursue further yield. Stride has also natively integrated the Hyperlane interoperability protocol, which allows movement of stTokens across the interchain and throughout the Celestia ecosystem.","links":"https://www.stride.zone/","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bridged-sttia-hyperlane/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0x48a612a6da945205a221e94bb9f40b0550cd2c4e"}}}
