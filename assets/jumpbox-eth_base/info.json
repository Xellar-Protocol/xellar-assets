{"name":"JUMPBOX.ETH","id":"jumpbox-eth_base","symbol":"jumpbox.eth","description":"$JUMPBOX.ETH is a community-governed development token that revolutionizes how Web3 projects are prioritized and built. Operating as a fully decentralized DAO on Base, it empowers token holders to directly influence development decisions through transparent, on-chain governance. The primary purpose of $JUMPBOX.ETH is to democratize development priorities by giving the community complete control over what gets built. Rather than top-down decision making, token holders collectively vote on projects, features, and initiatives that should receive development focus and resources. $JUMPBOX.ETH operates on the Base network with a total supply of 100,000,000,000 tokens distributed 100% publicly via liquidity pools with no team allocation. This fair launch model ensures complete decentralization from day one, with no private sales or reserved allocations. All tokens are distributed publicly through market mechanisms. The token operates as a direct democracy where token holders vote on development priorities and project proposals, the community decides resource allocation and technical standards, and democratic participation occurs through token-weighted voting rights. The DAO follows a structured governance process of proposal submission, community discussion, voting phase, approved project implementation, and progress tracking. Key features include community-driven development where all major development decisions are made through DAO governance, ensuring projects align with community needs and priorities. Token holders can stake $JUMPBOX.ETH through Rebase.finance to earn yield while participating in governance. The project features purpose-built governance contracts optimized for the Base network with modular architecture and security-focused design. Beyond governance, the DAO may vote to expand token utility for service payments, access control, or ecosystem rewards. Primary use cases involve project governance where holders vote on what development projects should be prioritized, resource allocation decisions about how development time and treasury funds are distributed, quality control through community review and approval of completed projects, and ecosystem participation through staking rewards and potential future utilities as determined by the DAO. Built on Base for low transaction costs and fast finality, $JUMPBOX.ETH features custom governance smart contracts with security measures, integration capabilities with modern Web3 development tools, modular design allowing for future upgrades and enhancements, and cross-chain compatibility potential for ecosystem expansion. The project emphasizes transparent, community-driven development where token holders have real influence over outcomes. Educational resources, open discussions, and regular progress reporting ensure informed participation in the governance process. $JUMPBOX.ETH represents a new paradigm in Web3 development governance, where the community truly controls the direction and priorities of technological advancement through decentralized decision-making.","links":"https://jumpbox.tech","market_cap":6968.68,"market_cap_rank":11847,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/jumpbox-eth_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x5b9957a7459347163881d19a87f6dc13291c2b07","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x5b9957a7459347163881d19a87f6dc13291c2b07"}},"is_native":false}
