{"name":"Dante","id":"dante","symbol":"dgpu","description":"DanteGPU is a decentralized platform that enables AI agents to efficiently utilize distributed GPU resources through the Solana blockchain. DanteGPU democratizes GPU access by eliminating central control, making high-performance computing available to everyone. With a decentralized infrastructure, GPU providers can offer their unused resources directly to AI developers and researchers, ensuring fair and efficient access to computing power. DanteGPU consists of two core marketplaces: an AI Agent Marketplace and a GPU Renting Marketplace. What makes DanteGPU unique is the integration of its own AI agent, Dantian AI, which optimizes usage by recommending the best AI agent-GPU matches. Users are free to manually choose GPUs, but the system provides optimized recommendations for better performance. Dante Token is a fully decentralized coin issued on the Solana blockchain. It was launched via pump.fun, ensuring an open-market and fair distribution. While the token is market-driven, it will also serve as a utility token within the DanteGPU ecosystem. Users can pay with either dGPU or Stablecoins, but using Dante Token will come with benefits such as discounts and incentives.","links":"https://dantegpu.com/","market_cap":94257,"market_cap_rank":7539,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dante/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"7xUV6YR3rZMfExPqZiovQSUxpnHxr2KJJqFg1bFrpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/7xUV6YR3rZMfExPqZiovQSUxpnHxr2KJJqFg1bFrpump"}}}
