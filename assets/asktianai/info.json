{"name":"AskTianAI","id":"asktianai","symbol":"tian","description":"AskTian is a decentralized AI oracle protocol that provides personalized spiritual guidance by fusing ancient metaphysical systems with AI reasoning. It draws from over 70 traditions — including BaZi, I Ching, Zi Wei Dou Shu, Qi Men Dun Jia, and Tarot — to generate context-aware divinations for individuals across identity, health, relationships, and destiny. Launched on the Base blockchain on 21 April 2025, AskTian introduces “Soul Signatures” — soul-bound tokens (SBTs) encoding each user’s cosmic blueprint. Powered by $TIAN, the project offers an interactive spiritual journey shaped through quests, karma, and seasonal rituals. The platform launched through a transparent, fair mechanism on Virtuals Protocol with no VC or insider allocations, establishing itself as the foundational oracle infrastructure for soul-based dApps.","links":"https://asktian.com/","market_cap":224293,"market_cap_rank":6273,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/asktianai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x795abcb2a9901f6ec510e18d40de08b84628c354","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x795abcb2a9901f6ec510e18d40de08b84628c354"}}}
