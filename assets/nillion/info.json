The network uses PETs (Privacy-Enhancing Technologies) to enable computation and storage on data while maintaining privacy, making possible use cases like private personalized AI, encrypted databases, data marketplace, and privacy-preserving applications. $NIL is the native utility token of the network that is used for: Network fees for blind computation and payments across the Coordination Layer and Petnet Staking to secure the network Governance participation the onchain governance module $NIL enables access to Nillion modules and services such as: DB: an encrypted database with data split up across multiple nodes. Calculations can still be performed on data while in encrypted form AI: AI-focused privacy technologies that include: AI Virtual Machine (AIVM) &ndash; a secure AI inference platform co-developed with Meta for private inference Nada-AI &ndash; a library for nilVM, offering an interface for running small AI models nilTEE & uses Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to run faster private inference where speed is important VM: VM with libraries that simplify program development for AI devs by letting them use Python and Javascript to write web3 programs","links":"https://nillion.com/","market_cap":57996495,"market_cap_rank":730,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nillion/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
