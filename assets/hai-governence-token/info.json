{"name":"Hai DAMO","id":"hai-governence-token","symbol":"damo","description":"HAI DAMO is a DAO-operated Asset Management Organization. More plainly, a DAO that specifically governs the management of assets. In this case specifically, it is the management of the composition of decentralized investment vehicles. The crypto asset class is still in its infancy, lacking many of the complex financial instruments that typically define more mature asset groups. Consequently, crypto investments are subject to extreme volatility and are thus unattractive to risk-averse investors. Their entrance into the crypto asset class will create an inflow of trillions of dollars, which makes for a sizable bounty for whoever can provide a vehicle to these investors. By providing decentralized investment vehicles to less risk-tolerant players, HAI DAMO has the potential to claim a piece of the trillion-dollar bounty while legitimizing crypto assets across the entire ecosystem.","links":"https://www.haidamo.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/hai-governence-token/logo.png"}
