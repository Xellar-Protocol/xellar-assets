Holders qualify for weekly raffles by trading at least 75% of their holdings each cycle (Monday–Sunday). Wallets are split into tiers, and winners are randomly selected with prize pools funded directly from Pump.fun’s dynamic creator fees. This system drives trading volume, rewards active participants, and gamifies the experience — giving traders both a chance to profit from market activity and to win additional rewards. Trade. Hold.
