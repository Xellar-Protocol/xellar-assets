{"name":"Auxilium","id":"auxilium","symbol":"aux","description":"Auxilium is based on the Ethereum code-base and is the first such currency to have launched with PoA (Proof of Authority) and the unique AID (Auxilium Interest Distribution) platform, rather than PoW or PoS. We decided that as we’re all about conservation, we’d need to write a PoA implementation with AID platform into our code-base to back up our environmental and philanthropical position and standing. As is the case with Ethereum, we have smart contracts, tokens and the ability for a developer to write dapps for use on the Auxilium blockchain.","links":"https://auxilium.global/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/auxilium/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
