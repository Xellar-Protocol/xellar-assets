{"name":"SAIKO•HAMSTER","id":"saiko-hamster","symbol":"$saiko","description":"Saiko is a coin inspired by a cute, yet slightly psycho hamster on a mission to shake up the Bitcoin social layer. Small in size, big on ambition—Saiko’s here to bring a little chaos and a lot of change to the crypto world. Saiko is more than just another meme-inspired crypto token; it’s a project that blends fun, innovation, and community-driven content into a new frontier on Bitcoin’s Runes protocol. The project revolves around Saiko, a cute yet slightly psycho anime hamster, who symbolizes the playful yet disruptive nature of the token. While it has origins in the meme coin meta, Saiko aims to build something more substantial by merging memes, creativity, and technology into a cohesive experience for users and creators alike.","links":"https://saikohamster.com/","market_cap":7373822,"market_cap_rank":1636,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/saiko-hamster/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ordinals":{"decimal_place":0,"contract_address":"846400:165"}}}
