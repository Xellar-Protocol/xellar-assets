{"name":"NORUGGIES","id":"noruggies_solana","symbol":"noruggies","description":"NoRuggies ($NORUGGIES) is a meme-driven blockchain ecosystem built around a core mission of increasing transparency and protection for early-stage token launches. The project combines cultural elements of meme communities with an infrastructure layer designed to reduce the frequency and impact of rug pulls. Its primary product is a Solana-based launchpad integrated directly inside Telegram. This launchpad allows developers to create new tokens while locking collateral into an on-chain bundle before deployment. If malicious activity or a liquidity rug is detected, smart contracts automatically liquidate the collateral and distribute refunds to affected holders. NoRuggies aims to transform speculative environments into safer, more accountable spaces by creating a self-correcting economic system where transparency is built into the launch process. The ecosystem also includes staking rewards, NFT-based membership tiers, a reputation scoring system for developers, and a public “Wall of Rugs” ledger that documents failed or malicious launches.","links":"https://noruggies.com/","market_cap":29655,"market_cap_rank":9049,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/noruggies/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"BwcamVymEARNdx2chNraY9CpJgKHUQk9Uj7m51tLpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/BwcamVymEARNdx2chNraY9CpJgKHUQk9Uj7m51tLpump"}},"is_native":false}
