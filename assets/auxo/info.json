{"name":"Auxo","id":"auxo","symbol":"auxo","description":"# About $AUXO $AUXO is an ERC-20 Token deployed on the Ethereum Network that represents shares of the Auxo DAO treasury. The AUXO token has a strictly controlled policy of expansion, it is designed to be non-dilutive versus the net asset value (NAV) of the treasury and there is no mechanism of inflation. The AUXO token is fully distributed to it’s token holders, aside from 20% of supply held by the DAO as protocol-owned-liquidity used in market making. ## Net Asset Value The Net Asset Value for AUXO is calculated as total assets held by the protocol divided by the total AUXO supply, in math terms: NAV = Assets / Total_Auxo_Supply ### Assets are comprised of: - Liquid assets held in the treasury - Illiquid assets held in the treasury - ETH side of AUXO-ETH pairs where the treasury is providing liquidity The valuation of the assets will follow a 7 day TWAP. The price of liquid assets will be recorded for TWAP computation every day at market open. — The price of illiquid assets will vary based on the nature of the liquid asset itself. In case of escrowed tokens such as esGMX, their price will be assumed to be the same as their liquid equivalents (i.e. GMX).) It is only possible to mint new tokens with governance approval, specifically via an inflow of new capital into the treasury at NAV value through a mechanism known as bonding. This feature ensures that previous holders are not diluted from newcomers joining the DAO.","links":"https://www.auxo.fi","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/auxo/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xff030228a046f640143dab19be00009606c89b1d"}}}
