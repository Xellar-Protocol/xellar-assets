{"name":"ENERGY","id":"energy","symbol":"nrgy","description":"Wind Finance is a blazingly fast and innovative DaaS on the Avalanche network, passive income up to 2,044% APR, NFTs, sustainability in your pocket. To be completely honest we plan to make a clean and safe fork of Universe. You can create your wind turbines today and get lifetime rewards from it. A \"node token\" is a token where people who create \"nodes\" lock their tokens in it forever. In return, they get perpetual yield through virtual (DaaS, DeFi-as-a-service) or real nodes (NaaS, Node-as-a-Service). The generated yield mostly varies from 1%-10% per day, Wind finance offers minimum 1.74% per day per wind turbine at the moment. The goal is to bring passive income to its holders through various means (grouped staking and farming mostly but not limited to) to help sustain the rate of emission, it allows holders to generate income through various protocols without having to deal with it. No network fees, swapping, bridging, staking or bonding are required. Wind finance calls it \"Wind turbines\" as they are very different on the technical side. However, it's conceptually similar to a DaaS.","links":"https://wind-finance.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/energy/logo.png"}
