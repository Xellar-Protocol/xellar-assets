{"name":"GIZA","id":"giza_arbitrum-one","symbol":"giza","description":"Giza Protocol powers agent-driven financial markets that transcend human cognitive limitations. Unlike basic automation, Giza's autonomous agents continuously analyze cross-protocol conditions, execute complex strategies, and adapt to market changes while maintaining complete user sovereignty. The protocol transforms DeFi through three key innovations: a semantic abstraction layer that standardizes protocol interactions, an agent authorization framework for granular permission management, and a decentralized execution network secured by GIZA token staking. Already processing millions in volume through thousands of active agents, Giza represents the evolution of finance where human intent and algorithmic intelligence converge to unlock unprecedented accessibility, customizability and capital efficiency.","links":"https://www.gizatech.xyz","market_cap":8228942,"market_cap_rank":1709,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/giza_arbitrum-one/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa4eaec0b1d564061a4951816fd5b1ba8cfbc425c","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/arbitrum/tokens/0xa4eaec0b1d564061a4951816fd5b1ba8cfbc425c"}},"is_native":false}
