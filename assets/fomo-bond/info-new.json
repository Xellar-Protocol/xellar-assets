We aim to provide a service which enables anyone to deploy a contract (with liquidity) on the ERC20 network, without having to worry about what might be, at times, extreme gas fee costs, thus hurting the chain's activity and potential overall.","links":"https://home.fomo.bond/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/fomo-bond/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x921d07059cb0640997251b577735a1bef90c408f"}}}
