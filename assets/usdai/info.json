{"name":"USDai","id":"usdai","symbol":"usdai","description":"USD.AI is a yield-bearing synthetic dollar backed by loans against AI hardware, compute, and DePIN assets. Targeting 15–25% APR, it functions like a high-yield bond index tied to income-generating infrastructure equipment, paired with additional mechanisms that allow arbitrageurs to bring back USDai back to a peg. USD.AI bridges the gap between amortizing AI hard assets and the financing needed to scale such productive infrastructure. Meanwhile, DePIN projects can achieve >300% growth using debt, driving reinvestment and scalability in their network.","links":"https://usd.ai","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/usdai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0a1a1a107e45b7ced86833863f482bc5f4ed82ef","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/arbitrum/tokens/0x0a1a1a107e45b7ced86833863f482bc5f4ed82ef"}}}
