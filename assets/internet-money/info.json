{"name":"Internet Money (ETH)","id":"internet-money","symbol":"im","description":"Internet Money (IM) was created to serve as a form of peer to peer \"digital cash\". The contract is simple: you can buy, sell, send and burn IM. Internet Money has no admin keys, no taxes, no reflections and is deflationary. Cryptocurrency was created to be a decentralized way to interact with money. We aim to take continual steps towards the decentralization of every facet of the Internet Money ecosystem; because we believe this is the way money should be: No centralized entities. No controlling forces. Power in the hands of the people.","links":"https://internetmoney.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/internet-money/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0a58153a0cd1cfaea94ce1f7fdc5d7e679eca936"}}}
