{"name":"Yadom Hongthai","id":"yadom-hongthai","symbol":"yadom","description":"$YADOM is a meme coin inspired by \"Hong Thai\" (หงษ์ไทย), a traditional Thai herbal inhaler widely recognized for its distinctive aroma and refreshing effect. Commonly used across Thailand and Southeast Asia, it has been a culturally significant item for decades. The $YADOM token reflects the humorous and nostalgic value of this everyday product. As a meme coin, it does not aim to provide financial utility or advanced blockchain functionality. Instead, it serves as a community-driven digital symbol celebrating Thai culture, local identity, and internet humor. With occasional appearances alongside global celebrities such as Lisa of BLACKPINK and Central Cee, the inhaler has become a quirky cultural icon—making $YADOM a playful tribute to its legacy in a modern, decentralized format.","links":"https://pump.fun/coin/8fLJCxZiMDd4e5wsXAGWEDdX7q2UgdW7EKeQU7jypump","market_cap":60254,"market_cap_rank":7316,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/yadom-hongthai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"8fLJCxZiMDd4e5wsXAGWEDdX7q2UgdW7EKeQU7jypump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/8fLJCxZiMDd4e5wsXAGWEDdX7q2UgdW7EKeQU7jypump"}}}
