{"name":"Gold Park","id":"gold-park_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"gpt","description":"What Is Gold Park? Gold Park is a blockchain initiative launched on 14/11/2024. It focuses on reshaping digital asset trading by blending advanced AI technology, security features, and user-friendly interfaces. The project’s core objective is to enhance liquidity, reduce trading costs, and offer reliable swaps across multiple ecosystems. Its approach aims to engage both novices and seasoned traders, providing an environment that supports efficient transactions and transparent processes. The team behind Gold Park conducted a lengthy development phase that involved thorough testing of various smart contract solutions. During this period, developers refined features and integrated AI-driven components to streamline digital trading. After unveiling its whitepaper and website, Gold Park built momentum through social media outreach and a growing community. These collective efforts helped establish a project roadmap focused on steady enhancements. Looking ahead, Gold Park intends to expand by listing its native token, GPT, on decentralized exchanges and forging partnerships in decentralized finance (DeFi). Planned milestones include governance mechanisms that allow token holders to influence the ecosystem’s direction, cross-chain solutions to improve interoperability, and collaborations with gaming or payment platforms. The team also plans to launch an in-house exchange to broaden the project’s scope and utility. By sharing consistent updates, Gold Park aims to maintain community engagement and continuously evolve. What Is the GPT Token? GPT is the utility token that powers the Gold Park ecosystem. It combines AI-driven algorithms, secure smart contracts, and an intuitive interface to optimize trading and everyday transactions. One key feature is its liquidity pool optimization, designed to reduce slippage and enable swift on-chain swaps for diverse trading groups. GPT’s architecture supports a streamlined user experience, targeting reduced gas fees and improved transaction times. Beyond traditional trading functions, GPT serves multiple use cases. It integrates with gaming ecosystems and e-commerce platforms, allowing holders to utilize the token for in-game purchases and online transactions. Additionally, GPT supports staking mechanisms that reward participants for securing the network. As Gold Park expands, new functionalities—such as governance features—are expected to further involve the community in decision-making processes, thereby fostering a more participatory environment. GPT’s adaptability makes it viable for users seeking a versatile digital asset. Besides facilitating smooth swaps, it underpins a variety of activities, including digital payments, utility bill settlements, and even physical gold exchanges. This broad applicability positions GPT as a flexible medium of exchange, aligned with Gold Park’s vision to accommodate both everyday needs and specialized use cases. How Many GPT Are in Circulation? Gold Park introduced GPT with an initial circulation of 9,000,000,000 tokens. This figure reflects the total amount available at launch on 14/11/2024. Distribution strategies and community incentives, such as staking rewards, are expected to impact how tokens move within the ecosystem over time. While the project’s whitepaper outlines the foundational allocation, additional details about lock-up periods or token burns may be revealed in future updates. The development team emphasizes transparency by regularly sharing progress through official channels and community discussions. As Gold Park’s roadmap advances, GPT’s role as a medium for payments, staking, and governance could broaden, potentially driving changes in the token’s distribution. By ensuring ongoing communication and incorporating community feedback, Gold Park seeks to maintain a sustainable supply model that underpins continued network growth.","links":"https://goldparktoken.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gold-park/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"0x35ae9accf59d646b181e816fdb86811671919d74","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x35ae9accf59d646b181e816fdb86811671919d74"}},"is_native":false}
