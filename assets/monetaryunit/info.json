The release of MonetaryUnit is staggered into 10 different stages. Each “stage” lasts about 18.5 days, and is made up of 40,000 “blocks”. Each block is released every 40 seconds, and a block is the reward for mining the MonetaryUnit network. The block reward changes at every stage, so that the number of coins released per day will change every 18.5 days up until stage 10. At stage 10, the number of coins released per day will always be 86,500 coins per day, or 40 MUE per block. MUE is a coin that has a fair launch with a block reward schedule that increases as time goes on. Here is the block reward schedule: 0.025 MUE reward for first 40,000 blocks (54 MUE/day) 1 MUE reward for next 40,000 blocks (2160 MUE/day) 2 MUE reward for next 40,000 blocks (4320 MUE/day) 4 MUE reward for next 40,000 blocks (8640 MUE/day) 8 MUE reward for next 40,000 blocks (17280 MUE/day) 10 MUE reward for next 40,000 blocks (21600 MUE/day) 20 MUE reward for next 40,000 blocks (43200 MUE/day) 30 MUE reward for next 40,000 blocks (64800 MUE/day) 40 MUE reward thereafter (86400 MUE/day)","links":"http://www.monetaryunit.org/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/monetaryunit/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
