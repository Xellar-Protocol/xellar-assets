{"name":"sGYD","id":"sgyd","symbol":"sgyd","description":"Gyroscope sets out to create stablecoin superliquidity. Gyroscope does so via its dual-offering of concentrated liquidity AMMs and a meta-stablecoin. Both products are designed to absorb complexity: - GYD is a meta-stablecoin that allows its holders to get one-stop-access to a diversified basket of stablecoins and advanced onchain risk controls. Yield earned by deploying GYD reserve assets is distributed to GYD stakers, via the sGYD ERC-4626 implementation. Reserve asset yield can also be streamed to GYD pools. - E-CLPs are CL AMMs - built on Balancer - that concentrate liquidity. As E-CLP price-bounds are defined on a per-pool level, LPs effectively subscribe to a portfolio-strategy, but take on no operational burden. E-CLPs are highly customizable and support yield-bearing assets and Aave deposit-receipt tokens. By using rate providers that factor out yield from asset prices it is possible to avoid drifting out of range. E-CLPs thus yield high capital efficiency, control over desired liquidity shapes, and a seamless LP experience. E-CLPs are also integrated into all major order routers.","links":"https://gyro.finance/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/sgyd/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xea50f402653c41cadbafd1f788341db7b7f37816"},"optimistic-ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xea50f402653c41cadbafd1f788341db7b7f37816"},"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xea50f402653c41cadbafd1f788341db7b7f37816"},"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xea50f402653c41cadbafd1f788341db7b7f37816"},"avalanche":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xea50f402653c41cadbafd1f788341db7b7f37816"}}}
