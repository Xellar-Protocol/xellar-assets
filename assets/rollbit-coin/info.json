{"name":"Rollbit Coin","id":"rollbit-coin","symbol":"rlb","description":"The Rollbit token (RLB) will be launched as an integral part of the upcoming Rollbit lottery. There will be no ICO for this token. Instead, Rollbit will airdrop RLB for free. Airdrops have been used throughout the history of cryptocurrencies to bootstrap growth, incentivise community development, and reward early adopters. The RLB token will live on the Solana chain, since it is more cost effective because of the current state of the Ethereum gas market. The major benefit of choosing Solana is that simple value transfers are very cheap and a lot faster compared to other Layer 1 blockchains","links":"https://rollbit.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/rollbit-coin/logo.png"}
