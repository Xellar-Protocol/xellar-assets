{"name":"ANARCHY","id":"anarchy-2_solana","symbol":"anarchy","description":"The project, Anarchy, is a community-driven cryptocurrency and social experiment that challenges the corrupt and manipulative elements of the crypto space. Unlike many projects that rely on a central developer or team, Anarchy was designed with trust and decentralization in mind. Its founder, Kendu Miazaki, intentionally stepped away after laying a strong foundation, burning 55% of the supply and locking liquidity to allow the community to take full control of the project. This bold experiment fosters organic, community-led growth while promoting fairness, freedom, and transparency.","links":"https://anarchyonsol.com/","market_cap":49282,"market_cap_rank":8245,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/anarchy-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"GYPxyPtu6g1NmnEPPkTcCdSZz7ZMs6A1S3wTjnLdpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/GYPxyPtu6g1NmnEPPkTcCdSZz7ZMs6A1S3wTjnLdpump"}},"is_native":false}
