{"name":"Vetter Skylabs","id":"vetter-skylabs","symbol":"vsl","description":"Skylabs is powered by its native BEP-20 token (VSL) and houses two independently functioning launchpad platforms — Launchpad and Vsale. Stakers of VSL get allocations in Launchpad projects and royalties from shared revenue generated from the VSL buy-sell tax and launchpads. Stakers receive 100% of the VSL buy tax and 33.33% of the sell tax, as well as 20% of revenue generated from both Launchpads. Only VSL stakers can participate in top-tier projects launching off Skylabs Launchpad. Vsale follows the standard “open launch” model giving developers a hub to launch projects to the public while locking liquidity. The founding team consists of Robyn Linn, Mike Klinger and Jeremy James. All with years of experience in cryptocurrency projects.","links":"https://vetter.ai/skylabs/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/vetter-skylabs/logo.png"}
