{"name":"Warpcore","id":"warpcore","symbol":"core","description":"Warpcore is a deflation and crosschain rewards engine on Base. It regulates value and protects against crosschain arbitrage. Algorithm Benefits Risk Mitigation: Linking Warpcore to Lightspeed provides a robust framework that minimizes typical cross-chain transaction risks. Deflation and Rewards: Warpcore not only powers the system but also reduces the supply of Lightspeed over time while rewarding users. Feeless Rewards Zero Tax on Native Token Swaps: Swapping Lightspeed with native tokens like ETH incurs no tax, promoting ease of use and liquidity. Tax on Direct Token Swaps: When swapping directly between Lightspeed and Warpcore, a tax applies. This mechanism is designed considering that the vast majority of transactions (99%) involve native tokens.","links":"https://lightspeed.foundation","market_cap":276011,"market_cap_rank":5146,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/warpcore/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe8e286b378254c4913c0c6964361636384b9d018"}}}
