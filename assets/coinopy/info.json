{"name":"Coinopy","id":"coinopy","symbol":"coy","description":"What is the project about? We are launching the Coinopy (COY) token to transform our established crypto education platform into a more immersive and participatory experience. The COY token will serve as a utility token that enables access to premium content, governance voting, discounts & rewards, and staking features to better engage our community of learners. What makes your project unique? Tokenizing Education: We are among the first to tokenize crypto education by aligning incentives through premium content access, governance, rewards etc. This makes the learning process more participatory. Community-Driven: Education is no longer a one-way street. Our learners can actively shape the platform and content through the COY token's governance protocols. Addressing Knowledge Gaps: By incentivizing premium content creation, we ensure our community has access to high-quality resources to address knowledge gaps. Belief in Web3 Values: The COY token embodies core Web3 values like decentralization, transparency, community ownership through its utility design and governance integration. Real-World Utility: Beyond speculative value, COY unlocks real-world utilities like content access, discounts, rewards and staking, giving it tangible use cases. Innovation in Legacy Field: We are innovating in the legacy field of education by integrating blockchain technology through tokenized incentives and governance. History of your project. Our project started with the goal of making crypto education accessible and enlightening for everyone. We launched Coinopy.com as an educational platform for both newbies and veterans in the crypto space. Over the years, Coinopy has established itself as a go-to destination for crypto insights, updates, and analysis. We have consistently created high-quality, comprehensive educational resources. However, as the market evolved, we realized passive content consumption wasn't enough. Users demanded more participation, engagement, and incentives from their educational experience. This led us to conceptualize the COY token as the next leap in Coinopy's journey. COY represents our innovation to make crypto education immersive, interactive, and community-driven through tokenized utilities and governance protocols. The COY token marks the beginning of a new chapter for Coinopy, one where we can truly gamify and incentivize learning through an educative token model. It will help us elevate our content quality, personalization, and overall user experience to the next level. Whatâ€™s next for your project? We have an exciting roadmap planned for the COY token and Coinopy platform: In the short term, we will focus on launching COY, implementing staking, unlocking premium content, and collaborating with partners to expand the token's utility. We also plan to introduce governance capabilities, allowing the community to vote on platform developments and educational content topics. Longer term, we aim to augment COY's utility by enabling discounts, cross-chain integrations, global outreach and more. We will constantly research new technologies and features to enhance the educational experience aligned with community feedback. Hosting AMAs, events and community engagement initiatives will be a persistent focus area to keep users involved. As Coinopy grows, so will COY's utility and real-world integrations. We envision COY becoming deeply embedded in the crypto education experience. While the roadmap provides direction, we are nimble to pivot based on market insights and community sentiment. Our goal is to organically grow while keeping education front and center. What can your token be used for? Our COY token unlocks a variety of real-world utilities and use cases within the Coinopy ecosystem: Access Premium Content: COY holders get exclusive access to our highest quality educational resources. Community Governance: COY allows holders to actively participate in shaping platform developments and content topics through voting mechanisms. Rewards & Discounts: Users can earn COY as rewards for community engagement. COY can also be used for discounts on Coinopy products/services. Staking: Earn staking rewards when holding COY over time, incentivizing long-term commitment. Participation Incentives: Performing actions like referrals, content contributions, surveys etc. will be rewarded with COY. Vibrant Community: Governance protocols and incentives promote high community participation and knowledge sharing. Future Integrations: As we scale, COY could be integrated with future products, services, and even games on our platform!","links":"https://coinopy.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/coinopy/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa4eb86b4e914ff1a4297032ec7de27b7b3512a08"}}}
