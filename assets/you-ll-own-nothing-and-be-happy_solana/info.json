The project reframes the phrase through satire and education, highlighting how a speculative scenario evolved into a meme, a conspiracy theory, and a symbol of real anxieties about ownership, digital rights, and consumer debt. The site functions as an accessible cultural explainer while the token expresses that narrative in crypto-native form.","links":"https://www.ownnothing.xyz","market_cap":1866957,"market_cap_rank":3034,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/you-ll-own-nothing-and-be-happy_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"F7pB3ZdfBnyFw2LRHydWEn9BmhEa5XihXLjhySFRpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/F7pB3ZdfBnyFw2LRHydWEn9BmhEa5XihXLjhySFRpump"}},"is_native":false}
