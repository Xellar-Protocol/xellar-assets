{"name":"XAU9999","id":"xau9999","symbol":"xau","description":"XAU-9999 is an Ethereum-based meme token that satirizes gold-backed digital assets by offering a symbolic, valueless version of “digital gold” with no physical backing or real-world utility. It is created solely for entertainment, community participation, and cultural parody, reflecting internet-native humor and crypto’s obsession with wealth, status, and digital ownership. The token has no financial utility and exists purely as a social and cultural artifact.","links":"https://xau9999.xyz/","market_cap":20436,"market_cap_rank":9913,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/xau9999/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x999903502c1c7fea3591fb17315544c6bdde7699","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x999903502c1c7fea3591fb17315544c6bdde7699"}}}
