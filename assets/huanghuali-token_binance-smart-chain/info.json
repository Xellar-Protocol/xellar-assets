{"name":"Huanghuali Token","id":"huanghuali-token_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"hlt","description":"Holy Token represents Hainan huanghuali, one of the rarest tree species, historically a royal tribute. Due to overlogging, it's nearly extinct, with two ancient trees priced over $2.5 million in the world's largest huanghuali park. This project supports rural revitalization by transforming traditional agriculture into a digital economy, ensuring traceability and value through blockchain technology. The HLT token (Holy Token) links each HLT directly to 1 gram of Hainan Huanghuali wood, creating a direct connection between the physical asset and the digital token. This unique value-mapping mechanism gives HLT tokens a tangible rarity and asset backing, ensuring value stability and investment security.","links":"https://www.holytoken.net","market_cap":108137,"market_cap_rank":6862,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/huanghuali-token_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":2,"contract_address":"0xe52a736828c782c2a4a345bbe8052aed010fc82d","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xe52a736828c782c2a4a345bbe8052aed010fc82d"}},"is_native":false}
