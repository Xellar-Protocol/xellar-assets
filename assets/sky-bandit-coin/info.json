{"name":"Sky Bandit Coin","id":"sky-bandit-coin","symbol":"sbc","description":"Sky Bandit is a fantasy hero-like parkour fighting game. Players operate the hero to face the enemies who are constantly raiding in the air. They can attack the enemy by moving left and right, collect loot, strengthen abilities, develop characters, improve game operations, and challenge more changes. The market is targeting the combination of \"Hyper-Casual\" and \"Mid-core\" players. In addition to the fast game process (session) and operation skills of casual games, it also introduces the collection and numerical development of moderate games. We hope to become the first Hyper-Casual RPG game in Taiwan that combines Hyper-Casual to develop RPG.
