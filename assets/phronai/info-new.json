{"name":"PhronAI","id":"phronai","symbol":"phron","description":"The First Layer 1/Layer 0 EVM Chain with Proof-of-Learning AI Consensus Mechanism. Phron AI (Layer 1) aims to revolutionize blockchain by integrating advanced AI into the consensus. PhronZero (Layer 0) empowers users to create dynamic, not static, Layer 1 blockchains. Current blockchains can't adapt to changing conditions, causing inefficiencies and security risks. Additionally, creating a Layer 1 blockchain is expensive and out of reach for everyday users. The new Proof-of-Learning Consensus Mechanism designed by PhronAI, called Sophia, offers dynamic and adaptive performance by constantly adjusting to the network environment. PhronZero enables users to roll out their own Layer 1 blockchain in minutes using AI tools. Additionally, users can monetize their AI solutions for Layer 1, making blockchain technology more accessible and profitable.","links":"https://phron.ai/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/phronai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
