You will be able to see what games are trending, view leaderboards, publish reviews, gain access to the most advanced GameFi alpha and interact with other members in real-time - all whilst being rewarded with the native $MCADE token for your own input into the community We want to put games back into the hands of gamers, and that is why $MCADE token holders will be able to vote on which developer-submitted games will receive funding via our Metagrants scheme. Web3 technology is revolutionising how the world functions and Metacade will revolutionise how a traditional community gaming hub is operated and owned.","links":"https://metacade.co","market_cap":7848718,"market_cap_rank":1744,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/metacade_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc48823ec67720a04a9dfd8c7d109b2c3d6622094","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xc48823ec67720a04a9dfd8c7d109b2c3d6622094"}},"is_native":false}
