{"name":"MemeFi","id":"memefi-2","symbol":"memefi","description":"MemeFi is a Web3 Social Tech game that stacks a complex social economy layer on top of PvP & PvE gameplay. In simple words, we make gaming more interesting by introducing keys that players trade to increase their rewards. Keys are acess tokens to a share of rewards from a specific player. Owning a key allows users capitalize on yield from players' gameplay activity, increasing their return. MemeFi is not just a game, but a living, breathing world with its peculiar laws and history. It's a chaotic universe full of perils and mysteries that exist in a crazy environment of eternal war between meme clans and memes themselves. MemeFi dwellers are hungry for gold and glory, rampanging through the meme lands and plundering riches, should they stumble upon them. While the deranged chaos has become a bit less apparent after the First Furious War, MemeFi is still not a place to trifle with.","links":"https://www.memefi.club/","market_cap":70241039,"market_cap_rank":759,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/memefi-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"sui":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x506a6fc25f1c7d52ceb06ea44a3114c9380f8e2029b4356019822f248b49e411::memefi::MEMEFI"}}}
