{"name":"LIFE","id":"life-2","symbol":"life","description":"Levels Protocol is the first evolutionary token protocol on Solana, redefining digital assets by enabling tokens to grow and evolve autonomously through smart contract-driven milestones. As market cap increases, tokens transform in real-time - updating their names, symbols, and metadata on-chain to reflect the shared achievements and progress of their communities. This seamless evolution, powered entirely by Solana’s decentralized infrastructure, happens without manual intervention, making each token a living representation of belief and momentum. Through the Levels Launchpad dApp, anyone can create their own evolving tokens, turning every price milestone into a gamified celebration of growth and success, where the journey itself becomes part of the reward.","links":"https://www.levelsprotocol.gg/","market_cap":5200.21,"market_cap_rank":10135,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/life-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"1FPs2RTXvLzW9r9MgRYfGgNJt4wcDUc3FpMeRpQLVLS","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/1FPs2RTXvLzW9r9MgRYfGgNJt4wcDUc3FpMeRpQLVLS"}}}
