{"name":"Imperial Obelisk [OLD]","id":"imperial-obelisk","symbol":"imp","description":"Imperial Obelisk is aiming to create an immersive resource gathering, world exploring and crafting experience game. We'll achieve this by taking on elements of games such as Minecraft, Decentraland and Terraria and combining them to create the ultimate indie adventure experience powered by NFTs. We've just finished the hiring process for a few developers and have a musician on board. Another idea we are following through is giving historical context to art pieces made by a community and then minting them as NFTs.","links":"https://imperialobelisk.net/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/imperial-obelisk/logo.png"}
