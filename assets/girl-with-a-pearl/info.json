{"name":"Girl with a Pearl","id":"girl-with-a-pearl","symbol":"pearl","description":"Girl With A Pearl Earring (PEARL) Date created: 1665 Johannes Vermeer's \"Girl with a Pearl Earring\" isn't just a painting-it's an emblem of cultural sophistication and artistic ingenuity. Departing from the confines of traditional portraiture, it delves into the realm of the 'tronie, a canvas where imagination reigns supreme. Here, we encounter a mesmerizing portrayal of a girl draped in exotic allure, her features adorned with an opulent turban and an audaciously large pearl. Vermeer's mastery of light is nothing short of transformative, casting an enchanting glow that delicately caresses the contours of the girl's face, illuminating her lips with a tantalizing radiance. And let's not forget the pearl-its luminosity serves as a beacon of Vermeer's unparalleled skill and vision. This masterpiece isn't just a stroke of artistic brilliance; it's a coveted treasure, valued not only for its aesthetic appeal but also for its rarity and monetary worth, fetching millions on the market. Now, naturally, its worth is beyond measure; the Mauritshuis would never even consider parting with it. In fact, the last Vermeer sold publicly, back in 2004, fetched $30 million, but it pales in comparison to the exquisite beauty of \"Girl with a Pearl Earring.\" It stands as a testament to Vermeer's enduring legacy and the enduring allure of artistic excellence. And now, it is on the Solana Blockchain.","links":"https://pearlcto.com","market_cap":65361,"market_cap_rank":8094,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/girl-with-a-pearl/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"9n1A8UtMXnnNdV1JJTc1sxhH47S4dVbcBgHqg96vdqQx","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/9n1A8UtMXnnNdV1JJTc1sxhH47S4dVbcBgHqg96vdqQx"}}}
