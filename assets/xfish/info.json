{"name":"Xfish","id":"xfish","symbol":"xfish","description":"What is XFish? In the bustling coastal town of Xfish Haven, where the scent of salt and the hum of fishing boats filled the air, lived a determined young fisherman named TK. With a weathered fishing boat handed down from his father, TK spent his days casting nets and lines, navigating the unpredictable seas to bring in a bountiful catch. Fishing wasn't just a pastime for him; it was a way of life, a means to earn a living in Xfish Haven. One day, as TK sold his latest haul at the bustling market, he stumbled upon a weathered map in an old fisherman's shop. The map depicted unexplored seas, marked with mysterious islands and promising treasures beyond imagination. Intrigued by the possibilities, TK decided to set sail and explore these uncharted waters, turning his humble fishing boat into an adventurous vessel. As he ventured into the unknown, TK encountered fierce storms, cunning pirates, and colossal sea monsters that tested his mettle. Yet, with each challenge overcome, he gained valuable experience and treasures that turned his fishing expeditions into legendary sea quests. The map became a guide to hidden realms, leading TK to discover ancient artifacts and rare marine life that fetched handsome prices in the market. Word of TK's exploits reached other ambitious fishermen in Xfish Haven, and soon, a group of like-minded adventurers joined him. They formed the Ocean Explorers Guild, pooling their resources to face the perils of the seas together. As their fleet grew, so did their ability to tackle larger challenges.","links":"https://xfishes.xyz/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/xfish/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x86d80fbb0701dd500767b7bc3af72d002eb5de77"}}}
