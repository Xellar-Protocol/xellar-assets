{"name":"Maia","id":"maia","symbol":"maia","description":"MAIA is the first decentralized reserve currency in Metis Andromeda. Different strategies will be applied in order to incentivize treasury growth, starting by the selective expansion of the bonds available, as well as, APY management and partnerships with other DAOs. Other strategies to be discussed within the DAO involve the current Curve Wars, options and farming. No $MAIA tokens will be allocated to team, early investors, marketing partnerships and if any wish to have exposure they will have to buy in after liquidity is added, furthermore this promotes alignment between the parts.","links":"https://maiadao.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/maia/logo.png","detail_platform":{"metis-andromeda":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x72c232d56542ba082592dee7c77b1c6cfa758bcd"}}}
