{"name":"Wombex","id":"wombex","symbol":"wmx","description":"Wombex is a yield aggregation and veToken accumulation protocol built on top of Wombat Exchange. The protocol operation is based on the rules of Wombat veToken model: Wombat offers base APY (offered to anyone supplying liquidity without any additional conditions) and boosted APY (depends on the user’s veWOM position) To create a veWOM position, the user needs to lock WOM for a certain amount of time (from 7 days to 4 years, longer lock-up corresponds to bigger number of veWOM received after locking) Based on the user’s veWOM position vs veWOM position of others, the boosted APY is calculated. In general terms — more WOM locked for a longer time leads to bigger veWOM position and, finally — a bigger APY for the user. Wombex’s primary purpose is to provide a WOM boost to LPs as a service and allow Liquidity Providers to earn high APY without the necessity to buy and stake WOM.","links":"https://wombex.finance/","market_cap":13667.69,"market_cap_rank":4957,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wombex/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa75d9ca2a0a1d547409d82e1b06618ec284a2ced"},"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x5190f06eacefa2c552dc6bd5e763b81c73293293"}}}
