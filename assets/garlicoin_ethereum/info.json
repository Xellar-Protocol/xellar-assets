Garlicoin formed on a few simple fundamentals - cheap and fast transactions, low barrier to entry and total focus on the community. These fundamentals have been put into practice, resulting in Garlicoin being a triumphant success: 40 second block times allow for blazingly fast confirmations, our ASIC resistant proof-of-work algorithm means anyone with a GPU can contribute to mining, and many important decisions have been made by the rapidly growing Garlicoin community.","links":"https://garlicoin.io/","market_cap":424835,"market_cap_rank":4819,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/garlicoin_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"0x58f7345b5295e43aa454911571f13be186655be9","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x58f7345b5295e43aa454911571f13be186655be9"}},"is_native":false}
