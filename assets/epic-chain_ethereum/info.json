{"name":"Epic Chain","id":"epic-chain_ethereum","symbol":"epic","description":"Epic is building a scalable infrastructure stack for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), unifying asset classes such as real estate, credit, commodities, and collectibles. It empowers individuals and institutions with a compliant and composable ecosystem to stake, trade, and spend RWAs seamlessly across borders. The EPIC token functions as a dual-network asset. It was launched as an ERC-20 on Ethereum and is structured to integrate with the XRP Ledger’s EVM-compatible sidechain. This positions Epic as a bridge between XRP and global RWA markets, reinforcing its mission to become the premier RWA product within the XRP economy. Active in more than 150 countries, Epic is developing an RWA superstructure that extends across consumer goods and capital markets. Its flagship consumer product, Fanable, generates over 1.2 million dollars annually in on-chain fees and is emerging as a leader in the consumer RWA sector. By leveraging the speed, scalability, and global reach of the XRP Ledger, Epic is positioned to deliver cutting-edge decentralized finance solutions that are interoperable, secure, and widely accessible.","links":"https://www.epicchain.io/","market_cap":18141268,"market_cap_rank":1172,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/epic-chain_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x94314a14df63779c99c0764a30e0cd22fa78fc0e","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x94314a14df63779c99c0764a30e0cd22fa78fc0e"}},"is_native":false}
