{"name":"PAWSWAP","id":"pawswap","symbol":"paw","description":"$PAW is an ERC-20 token with a total supply of 1 quadrillion. Born on the Ethereum blockchain, $PAW is more than just a token; it's a thriving and vibrant part of the dynamic PawChain community. As $PAW continues to grow, it powers the PawChain ecosystem, enabling transactions and facilitating community governance. Our future goals for $PAW are both ambitious and promising. The token will evolve from its current status as an ERC-20 token to a truly cross-chain asset. $PAW is set to be at the heart of our Layer-2 solution, PawChain, linking all our utilities together. It will fuel our decentralized exchange, PawSwap, driving swaps and staking options. $PAW will also be central to our planned DeFi eCommerce marketplace, Payment Cards, Wallet Hardware and much more, enabling transactions in a seamless digital and physical world. With our Layer-3 solution, we aim to connect all chains together, driving a truly interconnected ecosystem. Thus, $PAW isn't just a token - it's a key piece in the puzzle of a decentralized future.","links":"https://www.pawchain.net","market_cap":6791081,"market_cap_rank":1647,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pawswap/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xdc63269ea166b70d4780b3a11f5c825c2b761b01"}}}
