{"name":"Unite","id":"unite-2_base","symbol":"unite","description":"Unite is a protocol that powers the tokenization of gamers, enabling them to create and accrue value through their time, achievements, contributions, and influence in the gaming world. Through the protocol, a gamer’s identity and gameplay become tokenized assets — value gamers truly own, instant liquidity and usable in the real world. For developers and partners, Unite unlocks new ways to incentivize engagement, grow communities, and share in the value they co-create. By tokenizing the gamer and aligning the interests of all stakeholders, Unite is shaping a gamer-driven economy where all participants benefit from the value they help create.","links":"https://unite.io","market_cap":336353,"market_cap_rank":5137,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/unite-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa6c6ea2e0140849be02a3a34780cf61b766916c5","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xa6c6ea2e0140849be02a3a34780cf61b766916c5"}},"is_native":false}
