{"name":"Elon's Marvin","id":"elons-marvin","symbol":"marvin","description":"Elon’s Marvin token was founded on October 11, 2021. Elon’s Marvin is a brand new token powered by the Binance Smart Chain, and inspired by Elon Musk’s real life Havanese dog, Marvin, that he often talks about on Twitter, including this tweet on October 10, 2021: “I love ALW! Couldn’t agree more. My dog Marvin is Havanese too, although I’m *his* emotional support human.” Reflections 2% of each sale will be put into a wallet which will distribute Marvin rewards to holders. The more you hold the more you receive. Liquidity 4% of every transaction will be added to liquidity. This helps keep the floor price of the token high and lessens the effects of big sells. Protecting you and the token from whale manipulation. Marketing The 2% marketing fee of each transaction ensures the capability of having funds to pay for marketing, listings, donations etc. If needed the Marketing wallet can also burn tokens for an increase in value or add liquidity to pancakeswap.","links":"https://www.elonsmarvin.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/elons-marvin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x54017fda0ff8f380ccef600147a66d2e262d6b17"},"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x81c159f7abaa9139227aff62959b86b4141f6eb2"}}}
