{"name":"BLACK HOLE","id":"black-hole-2_base","symbol":"blkh","description":"Black Hole Protocol is a decentralized, self-custodial privacy architecture deployed on the Base network. It addresses the inherent lack of transaction privacy on public blockchains by combining Account Abstraction (ERC-4337) with Zero-Knowledge proofs (ZK-SNARKs). The protocol functions as a cryptographic firewall between a user's identity and their assets. Unlike traditional interaction models where a single Externally Owned Account (EOA) exposes a user's entire history and net worth, Black Hole utilizes a \"Shielded Pool\" for ingress and a novel \"Balance Sharding\" mechanism for storage. This architecture allows users to interact with DeFi applications and execute payments without leaking metadata or exposing their total holdings.","links":"https://blkh.io/","market_cap":342841,"market_cap_rank":5094,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/black-hole-2_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd63f21e7f4205d59c5b486273c42e261d5cd4d1d","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xd63f21e7f4205d59c5b486273c42e261d5cd4d1d"}},"is_native":false}
