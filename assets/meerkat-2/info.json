{"name":"Meerkat","id":"meerkat-2","symbol":"merk","description":"Meerkat is an AI-powered meme ecosystem designed to enable users to create, automate, and monetize meme-driven economies. At its core is The Burrow, a platform where users can launch Meme AI Agents—AI-driven tokens that autonomously generate memes, engage communities, and sustain their own economies through automated bonding curve liquidity. The ecosystem is powered by $MERK, the native utility token used for staking, governance, and ecosystem interactions. Users can stake $MERK to earn rewards, access AI tools, and interact with miniapps and games. Meerkat also features the Meerkat Wallet, a multi-chain Web3 wallet supporting 20+ networks and over 1M tokens, ensuring seamless asset management and participation in the AI-driven meme economy.","links":"https://www.meerkat.wtf/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/meerkat-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
