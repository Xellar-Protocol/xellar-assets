{"name":"Skate","id":"skate_solana","symbol":"skate","description":"Skate is a multi-VM infrastructure project that lets any decentralized application run seamlessly across multiple blockchains—both EVM and alternative VMs. It also provides native access to VM-specific applications on other chains, so EVM apps can operate directly within SVM or MOVE environments . Skate's core product is the Skate AMM, enabling a multi-VM, single-liquidity-curve across all chains.","links":"https://www.skatechain.org/","market_cap":1304226,"market_cap_rank":3433,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/skate_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"9v6BKHg8WWKBPTGqLFQz87RxyaHHDygx8SnZEbBFmns2","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/9v6BKHg8WWKBPTGqLFQz87RxyaHHDygx8SnZEbBFmns2"}},"is_native":false}
