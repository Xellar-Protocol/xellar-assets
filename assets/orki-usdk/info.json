{"name":"Orki USDK","id":"orki-usdk","symbol":"usdk","description":"Orki Finance is a decentralized stablecoin protocol native to Swellchain, a restaking-focused Layer 2 built on the OP Superchain. The protocol is an exclusive fork of Liquity V2, enabling users to mint USDK—a USD-pegged stablecoin—by depositing yield-bearing collateral such as liquid staking tokens (LSTs) and liquid restaked tokens (LRTs). Orki Finance is designed to provide capital efficiency, risk diversification, and seamless integration with the broader Superchain ecosystem, offering users a permissionless and non-custodial way to access stable liquidity while retaining exposure to staking rewards.","links":"https://www.orki.finance/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/orki-usdk/logo.png","detail_platform":{"swellchain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0000baa0b1678229863c0a941c1056b83a1955f5","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/swellchain/tokens/0x0000baa0b1678229863c0a941c1056b83a1955f5"}}}
