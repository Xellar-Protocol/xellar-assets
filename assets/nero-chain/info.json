{"name":"NERO Chain","id":"nero-chain","symbol":"nero","description":"NERO is an application-first blockchain that introduces programmable blockspace pricing and Paymasters, allowing developers to set their own tokens as gas and control fee logic. Instead of fees flowing to the chain, revenue is shared with apps. This creates stronger incentive alignment, reduces CAC, and increases token demand - turning dApps into self-sustaining businesses. NERO enables dApps in SocialFi, GameFi, and RWA to build long-term business models using their own tokens as gas. With innovations like consignment blockspace and custom Paymaster APIs, NERO makes blockchain fees programmable and value-sharing automatic. This empowers developers to price priority, control UX, and retain the value they generate - no need to build their own infrastructure.","links":"http://www.nerochain.io/","market_cap":6648983,"market_cap_rank":2127,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nero-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
