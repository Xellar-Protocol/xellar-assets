{"name":"Strike","id":"strike-2","symbol":"strike","description":"Strike Finance introduces options, forwards, and perpetual futures trading directly on the Cardano blockchain. Currently, centralized exchanges account for more than 98% of derivatives trading in crypto assets. Derivatives trading on Cardano are nearly non-existent before the advent of Strike Finance. This scarcity is not due to a lack of demand for on-chain trading, but rather the absence of a derivatives protocol. Options, forwards, and perpetual futures trading offer traders a wider range of tools to capitalize on the volatile crypto market. Strike Finance streamlines this process by providing a beginner-friendly trading experience. Our platform empowers individuals with advanced financial instruments while maintaining the security and transparency inherent to blockchain technology.","links":"https://strikefinance.org/","market_cap":4261617,"market_cap_rank":2519,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/strike-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"cardano":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"f13ac4d66b3ee19a6aa0f2a22298737bd907cc95121662fc971b5275"}}}
