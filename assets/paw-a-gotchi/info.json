{"name":"Paw-a-Gotchi","id":"paw-a-gotchi","symbol":"pag","description":"Paw-a-Gotchi is a digital pet raising simulator being developed in Unreal Engine 5 with integrated crypto utility features that allows players to adopt and raise a pet, eventually entering it into competitions against other playersâ€™ pets to earn real rewards. The idea of Paw-a-Gotchi was born out of an attempt to combine the late 90s sensation Tamagotchi, the power of Unreal Engine 5, and the decentralized nature of blockchain as grounds for fair competition between a strong community. As a team we dreamed of a game that will provide the chill experience of raising a Tamagotchi style pet in a calm neighborhood while retaining the exciting nature of competing against other community members for real rewards in the world of crypto. Adding Unreal Engine to the mix allowed us to pepper this formula with fun and creative auxiliary activities to break the monotony of repetitive gameplay, not to mention cutting edge visuals.","links":"https://pawagotchi.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/paw-a-gotchi/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x32a5fc22e20903e78171977359b500060b7316bf"}}}
