CHOPBOT allows holders to gamble on an easily used telegram bot 24 hours a day. Trading the coin has a 3% buy and sells tax in order to help burn the supply, provide liquidity for the token, and pay for marketing without the team having to sell any tokens. $CHOP launched on 15 August 2023. It was a fair launch allowing the open public to purchase from the ground floor. The team is currently working on new games for the telegram bot as well as a revenue share to provide more value to holders.","links":"https://chopbot.xyz/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/chopbot/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"0x875154c31b8858fdda9c7ccbed7ec15dc95943ae"}}}
