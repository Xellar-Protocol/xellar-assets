{"name":"Electron (ARC-20)","id":"electron-arc-20","symbol":"electron","description":"Electron is a pioneering token in the ARC20 ecosystem, notable for being the first to implement high-difficulty Proof of Work (PoW) mining. This advanced mining approach demands greater computational capacity, ensuring a fairer distribution of the token and making it less prone to centralization, aligning with Bitcoin's principles of decentralization. In addition to this unique mining structure, Electron is directly backed by Bitcoin, adding a distinctive layer of security and value. This backing means that each unit of Electron maintains a value closely tied to the price of Bitcoin. Linked to BTC, Electron functions as a type of \"colored Bitcoin\", giving users a way to own Bitcoin in a token format with enhanced capabilities. This is possible thanks to the ARC20 protocol, which allows Electron to integrate both the robustness of the Bitcoin blockchain and new functionalities, such as smart contracts and cross-chain interoperability. Electron's value also reflects Bitcoin’s price behavior: when Bitcoin appreciates, each Electron’s value increases as well, giving users a way to gain exposure to Bitcoin through this enhanced digital asset. This kind of backing ensures transparency and trust for users, positioning Electron as a bridge between the world of digital assets and advanced ARC20 applications, such as smart contracts, future DeFi projects, and other developments built on Bitcoin. Electron represents a secure and improved extension of Bitcoin’s value within the ARC20 ecosystem. Its innovative structure provides a unique opportunity to explore the next generation of digital assets within Bitcoin’s secure framework, strengthening both ARC20’s infrastructure and the user experience within this emerging technology","links":"https://electronarc20.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/electron-arc-20/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":"536737aadfaffa17233bca342be2571e14916f6a29003ff4766d515283e68e90i0"}}}
