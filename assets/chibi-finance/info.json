{"name":"Chibi Finance","id":"chibi-finance","symbol":"chibi","description":"Chibi Finance is born out of the team's wish that things would be more convenient within DeFi in order to encourage mass adoption by retail. The team has seen many successful examples where non-crypto people are brought into crypto without knowing crypto, the most notable recent example would be Pudgy Penguins. Chibi Finance currently offers a Yield Farming Optimizer, initiated on the Arbitrum Chain. We provide DeFi users with auto-compounded yields at optimal intervals via pooling gas costs through our smart contracts. Users will also receive CHIBI tokens when they stake in our vaults. These CHIBI emissions are a form of reward for our early users! Through the use of CHIBI native emissions on our vaults, we can guarantee the best APY rates from our vaults for farms across the ecosystem.","links":"https://chibi.finance","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/chibi-finance/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb3180df05e46f9fcdd589a2023470a9007df01ca"}}}
