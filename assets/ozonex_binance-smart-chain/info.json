{"name":"OzoneX","id":"ozonex_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"ozone","description":"OzoneX is a blockchain-based platform that issues OZONE, a BEP-20 utility token designed to provide digital economic exposure to Indonesian nickel market dynamics while remaining a non-security utility token. The platform connects token holders to an ecosystem of services—staking, governance, and access to data and analytics—related to nickel supply chains and RWA (real world assets) monitoring. OzoneX does not entitle holders to profit-sharing from mining operations or ownership of physical assets; instead, the token’s primary functions are payment for platform services, governance participation, and staking within a pre-determined emission schedule. The project emphasizes transparency through on-chain token allocations, public smart contract code, and audited proof-of-reserve reporting for partnering mining operations.","links":"https://docs.ozonehub.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ozonex/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xefe12eb89bae92f57b0e7ba3c4dfeee9627ee12a"}},"is_native":false}
