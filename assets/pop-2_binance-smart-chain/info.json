{"name":"Zypher Network","id":"pop-2_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"pop","description":"Zypher Network is a decentralized protocol building the trust infrastructure for the AI agent economy. As AI agents increasingly manage financial flows, compliance processes, customer support, and automated operations, Zypher tackles the core challenge: agent execution today is opaque, unverifiable, and vulnerable to manipulation. By applying advanced cryptographic schemes and a modular blockchain stack, Zypher enables transparent, tamper-resistant verification for autonomous agentic systems—much like SSL transformed the web into a secure environment. At its core, Zypher introduces Proof of Prompt (PoP), a cryptographic protocol that links an input prompt to its resulting output in a verifiable way. Through proxy signing, encryption, and distributed validation, PoP ensures that agent instructions and responses remain intact, traceable, and auditable without revealing sensitive data. Zypher extends this foundation into a full product suite, including the AI Security Browser, which gives users real-time trust ratings for AI agents, and a RESTful API & SDK that allow developers to embed integrity verification and performance scoring directly into their applications. The network is powered by Zytron, an AI-optimized execution layer built on BNB Chain. Zytron supports high-throughput agent workloads with heterogeneous compute resources and leverages a Proof of Verifiable Work mechanism to coordinate validation tasks across a decentralized prover community. This design enables scalable, low-latency proof generation suitable for millions of daily verifications. For end users, Zypher makes AI safety participatory. Its Proof Mining system allows the community to validate agent outputs, detect anomalies, and contribute ratings across twelve safety and usability dimensions. Participants earn tokens and NFTs for their contributions, creating an incentive layer similar to a decentralized “TrustPilot for AI Agents.” By combining enterprise-grade auditing with community feedback, Zypher offers both developers and consumers a transparent way to evaluate and trust AI services.","links":"https://zypher.network/","market_cap":940713,"market_cap_rank":3819,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pop-2_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa3cfb853339b77f385b994799b015cb04b208fe6","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xa3cfb853339b77f385b994799b015cb04b208fe6"}},"is_native":false}
