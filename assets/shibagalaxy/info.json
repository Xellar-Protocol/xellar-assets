{"name":"ShibaGalaxy","id":"shibagalaxy","symbol":"shibgx","description":"ShibaGalaxy one of the simplest Play-To-Earn NFT games. You just need a Shiba Chest to receive a random shiba for participating in ShibaGalaxy. You will fight against the fiery bears to defend the ShibaGalaxy. Eventually, the winner will receive SHIBGX. You have to own at least 1 Shiba to fight against the angry bears and get rewarded. As of now, only a limited number of Shiba chests are available for sale. If all Shiba chests are sold out, you have to purchase Shibas from the marketplace by making payment using SHIBGX tokens only. If the enemy is strong, the reward will be even higher. But players should choose their opponent wisely. Because when you have more victories you will accumulate more reward points too. If your track record is good and you have more wins than losses, you will get SHIBGX tokens as reward for participating in the game.","links":"https://shibagalaxy.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/shibagalaxy/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x7420d2bc1f8efb491d67ee860df1d35fe49ffb8c"}}}
