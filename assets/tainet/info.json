{"name":"TaiNet","id":"tainet","symbol":"tai","description":"Introducing yTAO: The First Native TAO Compatible, Yield-Optimized-By-AI, Liquid Staking Token (LST) For The Bittensor Ecosystem With its launch in March 2023, Bittensor single-handedly revolutionized both the AI and blockchain markets with its decentralized marketplace for machine learning. By creating a peer-to-peer market for machine intelligence, it provided a platform for AI developers to get access to an incentivized network of machine learning models. At the heart of its innovative model lies the TAO token, which represents the contributions that individual developers have made to the network and the quality of their models. TAO effectively serves as a representation of the collective intelligence and insights contained within the network. However, the TAO token currently faces two major hurdles in unlocking its full value. Firstly, to earn yield on their TAO tokens, holders must stake them, which locks them up, making them inaccessible for deploying in further yield-bearing activities. Meanwhile, the process of staking involves delegating your TAO to subnet validators. Determining the optimal subnet validator to delegate to on an ongoing basis is an active process with many complex variables, meaning most stakers are receiving suboptimal yields.","links":"https://tainet.finance/","market_cap":352613,"market_cap_rank":4878,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/tainet/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x5becd80848e096d065f27c3b1498553c705c77ed"}}}
