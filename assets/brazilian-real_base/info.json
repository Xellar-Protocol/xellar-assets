{"name":"Brazilian real","id":"brazilian-real_base","symbol":"wbrl","description":"wBRL is a fully collateralized stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the Brazilian real (BRL). Issued and governed by a Ripio subsidiary, it brings BRL on-chain so Brazilians and global users can transact, save, and build on decentralized networks in their local currency. Backed by Ripio’s since-2013 track record in LATAM, wBRL enables faster, cheaper BRL transfers, FX and remittance flows, DeFi trading and lending, and seamless on/off-ramps and payments without leaving the BRL unit of account.","links":"https://ripio.com/es/criptos/stablecoins-locales","market_cap":100142,"market_cap_rank":7003,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/brazilian-real/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd76f5faf6888e24d9f04bf92a0c8b921fe4390e0","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xd76f5faf6888e24d9f04bf92a0c8b921fe4390e0"}},"is_native":false}
