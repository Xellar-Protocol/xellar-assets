{"name":"ZChains","id":"zchains","symbol":"zcd","description":"ZChains is a Layer 1 blockchain, running on the PoS consensus mechanism. Being EVM compatible, ZChains supports communication with multiple blockchain networks, enabling transfers of both ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, by utilising the centralised bridge solution. ZChains aims to onboard all kinds of decentralised applications (dApps) that wish to expand beyond their blockchains to build on ZChains, creating limitless possibilities. ZChains is powered by its underlying native token, ZCD. Naturally, ZCD is used for utility purposes such as paying gas fees, staking and block rewards. ZCD is also an asset crypto, or as stores of value much like ETH. ZCD can be traded on major decentralised (DEX) and centralised (CEX) crypto exchanges.","links":"https://www.zchains.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/zchains/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
