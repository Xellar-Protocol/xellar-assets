{"name":"The Dragon Gate","id":"the-dragon-gate","symbol":"koi","description":"The Dragon Gate is a fully decentralized token and community that follows a humble vision. The KOI contract is renounced and LP is burnt giving power to the community within a perfectly decentralized ecosystem of courage, perseverance and honesty. Legend says the carp come together every year to try and swim against the current and up the waterfall where the legendary dragon gate exists. This legend is the basis of our community, vision and values. We are all in it together, fairly. Only the humble and courageous will make it to the Dragon Gate.","links":"https://thedragongate.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/the-dragon-gate/logo.png"}
