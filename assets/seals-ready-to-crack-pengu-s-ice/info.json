{"name":"Seals-Ready to Crack Pengu's Ice","id":"seals-ready-to-crack-pengu-s-ice","symbol":"seals","description":"\"Seals-Ready to Crack Pengu's Ice\" is a project that leverages the natural rivalry between seals and penguins, symbolizing our dominance and strength in the Solana ecosystem. Just as seals are natural predators of penguins, we aim to outperform and overshadow Pengu and its followers in the digital realm. This project is not just about creating another NFT; it's about establishing a new world order where $Seals lead, using strategic marketing and mass production to increase our visibility and influence.","links":"https://seals.army/","market_cap":19365.59,"market_cap_rank":10001,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/seals-ready-to-crack-pengu-s-ice/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"BKQwzUrcibzZsm1Sm9TVgzxA9G7bAYszCaGJcALMpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/BKQwzUrcibzZsm1Sm9TVgzxA9G7bAYszCaGJcALMpump"}}}
