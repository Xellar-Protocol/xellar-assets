{"name":"Chachamaru","id":"chachamaru","symbol":"chacha","description":"The Chacha Coin project, launched by the X user @pekotaro930 on April 30, 2025, is a cryptocurrency initiative inspired by their Shiba Inu dog named Chacha. Featuring whimsical artwork of Chacha with balloons on a hill, the project is intended purely for entertainment purposes, with @pekotaro930 explicitly stating that the coin holds no monetary value. As a self-described cryptocurrency novice, @pekotaro930 created Chacha Coin to engage their community, which includes over 100,000 followers and significant social media engagement, such as 1 million likes on a recent video. The token operates on a blockchain with the contract address 9Wkcek2EZFmJf5L2XmC5rfnNVBrdndbMe6yW8fbfbonk and has garnered community interest, with supporters forming a growing online presence and advocating for its visibility on platforms like decentralized exchanges (DEX). Despite its playful origins, some community members see potential in its narrative as a lighthearted, dog-themed cryptocurrency.","links":"https://x.com/i/communities/1917612694011801828","market_cap":83275,"market_cap_rank":7725,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/chachamaru/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"9Wkcek2EZFmJf5L2XmC5rfnNVBrdndbMe6yW8fbfbonk","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/9Wkcek2EZFmJf5L2XmC5rfnNVBrdndbMe6yW8fbfbonk"}}}
