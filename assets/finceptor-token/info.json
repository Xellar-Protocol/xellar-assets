{"name":"Finceptor","id":"finceptor-token","symbol":"finc","description":"Finceptor is a DeFi liquidity protocol with a launchpad plug-in, enabling unlaunched and publicly traded tokens to build protocol-owned liquidity – solving DeFi 1.0’s mercenary liquidity problem. Liquidity Mining, providing token incentives to retail liquidity providers (LP), is highly expensive, unsustainable, mercenary, and rented. DeFi needs better liquidity management. We’re building a suite of first-in-the-market liquidity products enabling projects to bootstrap and grow their protocol-owned liquidity – liquidity vaults and bonds. Moreover, we also have our own launchpad plug-in strategically placed to attract top Web3 projects and help them grow their liquidity. - Liquidity Vault is an on-chain initial liquidity bootstrapping tool to build protocol-owned liquidity for unlaunched tokens. - Bond is a structured protocol-owned liquidity growth and token liquidation tool for publicly traded tokens. - Launchpad for a strategic token launch and sales arm.","links":"https://finceptor.app","market_cap":1168255,"market_cap_rank":3019,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/finceptor-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa856098dcbc1b2b3a9c96c35c32bc4f71e49aed2"}}}
