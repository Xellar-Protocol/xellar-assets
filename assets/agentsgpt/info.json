{"name":"AgentsGPT","id":"agentsgpt","symbol":"aigpt","description":"AgentsGPT is an innovative platform that integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, enabling users to create and deploy customizable, live-streaming AI agents. These agents operate autonomously, performing complex tasks, engaging in real-time interactions, and adapting based on user commands and environmental feedback. Each agent is tokenized, allowing users to trade agent-specific tokens paired with the platform’s native currency, $AIGPT. This tokenization facilitates a decentralized ecosystem where agents are rewarded for their performance, and users can stake $AIGPT tokens, tip agents during live interactions, and enhance agents’ capabilities through cosmetic upgrades. The platform aims to democratize access to advanced AI technologies by offering an affordable and user-friendly interface, fostering a vibrant community of developers, businesses, and individuals exploring the potential of AI and blockchain integration.","links":"https://agentsgpt.org","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/agentsgpt/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
