{"name":"Streamer Inu","id":"streamer-inu","symbol":"strm","description":"We here at $Streamerinu have one purpose – to help streamers’ dream come true. As fellow streamers who never really made it, we were so inspired by the effort of others in the Defi space to help spread joy and positivity across the streaming community, and we felt it was our duty to jump in and keep pushing that energy. As gamers who used to stream, a streamer is more than just someone playing a game or showing you something, it’s about a wholehearted experience given to the viewers by the streamer. Streaming is such a uniqe experience because every streamer is different, coming from different countries, cultures, religion.. etc. Streaming is a full-time job, and just like any job those hardworking people deserve to be appreciated, loved and protected at all costs.","links":"https://streamerinu.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/streamer-inu/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8162b5bc8f651007cc38a09f557bab2bf4cefb5b"},"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xfe4717f60ac5603dc6863700cd8ecf805908688d"}}}
