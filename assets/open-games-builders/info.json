{"name":"Open Games Builders","id":"open-games-builders","symbol":"ogb","description":"Open Games Builders (OGB) emerges as a groundbreaking platform poised to revolutionize the gaming-NFT landscape. At its core, OGB is a decentralized ecosystem that transcends the traditional boundaries of gaming, offering users a paradigm-shifting experience in the realm of digital asset ownership. The platform acts as a bridge between the gaming and blockchain worlds, fusing the excitement of gaming with the transformative potential of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). OGB envisions a gaming ecosystem where players are not just participants but active contributors, co-creators, and owners of in-game assets. Unlike traditional gaming platforms where the value of in-game items is confined within closed environments, OGB introduces the concept of true ownership through NFTs. Every in-game asset, whether it's a rare weapon, a unique character skin, or any valuable item, becomes a tradable, real-world asset on the blockchain.","links":"https://www.opengamesbuilders.com","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/open-games-builders/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x84a3c21335ac84dcaddfb45e7be6b21bed34183d"}}}
