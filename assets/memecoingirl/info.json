Created by an individual, not a foundation, all tokens were added to the liquidity pool upon creation, and then burned, with ownership renounced. This ensures that the project operates in a truly decentralized manner, without any central authority or control. MemeCoinGirl's purpose is to foster a community-driven culture around meme coins, promoting a decentralized environment where all participants grow together. The total supply of $MIKO tokens is 100 billion, with no reserved tokens for foundations or team members, emphasizing a community-first approach.","links":"https://memegirlmiko.xyz/","market_cap":125638,"market_cap_rank":5913,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/memecoingirl/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x4e09ac09eb332f4dd167b8bfb90c7f247f7350ac"}}}
