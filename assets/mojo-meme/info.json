{"name":"Mojo Meme","id":"mojo-meme","symbol":"mojo","description":"Once upon a time in the crypto world, there was Mojo, with a knack for sniffing out the next 1000x meme coin. While his wealth grew, so did the jealously of those around him, until one day, he was thrown off a cliff and left for dead. With his face taking most of the impact, his nose became huge and his life became miserable, he lost his Mojo - he was angry, lifeless. Nothing seemed to be going right anymore. Those years were tough, but he didnâ€™t give up. He opened his computer, reignited his business, started working out, and his nose began to shrink. Slowly but surely, he was on track to getting his MOJO back!","links":"https://www.mojomeme.xyz/","market_cap":14961.55,"market_cap_rank":7490,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mojo-meme/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe729b15de141944abcea3cceb8e4407ce0dafa08"}}}
