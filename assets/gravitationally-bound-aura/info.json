{"name":"Gravitationally Bound AURA","id":"gravitationally-bound-aura","symbol":"graviaura","description":"graviAURA is a semi-liquid locked AURA token designed to support its own liquidity on the Balancer AMM. graviAURA held in a Balancer liquidity pool will vote for emissions to the pool it is in, while graviAURA held outside of LP will vote to collect bribes which are auto-compounded in Badger vaults. graviAURA can be minted and redeemed against AURA in the Badger dapp at https://app.badger.com/vault/aura-graviaura. USE CASES - AURA HOLDERS can deposit their AURA into graviAURA and earn yield from auto-harvested bribes as the ecosystem develops. - DAOs can include graviAURA in Balancer pools for set-and-forget liquidity incentive for their pool since graviAURA automatically votes for Balancer pools it is included in. LOCKING AURA deposited into graviAURA is locked in Aura governance for periods of 16 weeks before unlocking for a period of one week. During these periods where there is unlocked AURA there is the ability to withdraw from the vault. While tokens are not immediately available, in any 16 week period the vault can be completely withdrawn. SECURITY graviAURA has been audited by Code4ena and is built on Badger's Vaults 1.5 architecture which has been audited by Quantstamp.
