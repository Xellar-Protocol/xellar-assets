{"name":"Stargate Bridged USDC (Fuse)","id":"stargate-bridged-usdc-fuse","symbol":"usdc.e","description":"This is a Stargate bridged USDC.e version on Fuse network. Circle announced the launch of USD Coin (USDC) on Avalanche , which is the native USDC token on the Avalanche blockchain (specifically, Avalanche C-Chain). Circle customers are able to mint native USDC on Avalanche from the Circle Account and Circle APIs. Similar to other native USDC tokens on other blockchains, you can deposit USDC on Avalanche back into a Circle Account and off-ramp to fiat currency seamlessly. USDC.e on Avalanche is a \"bridged form of USDC on Ethereum\" that was bridged from the Ethereum blockchain via the Avalanche Bridge. For this reason, USDC.e is not the same as native USDC. Circle products do not support USDC.e. You cannot send USDC.e to a Circle deposit address. To elaborate, it is not possible to use USDC.e in the Circle APIs, nor deposit USDC.e into a Circle Account and off-ramp back to fiat currency. To off-ramp back to fiat currency with USDC.e, you would need to \"unbridge\" the USDC.e back to the Ethereum blockchain via the Avalanche Bridge. After the \"unbridging\", you would end up with native USDC on Ethereum. At that point, you would be able to deposit the USDC on Ethereum into your Circle Account and off-ramp to fiat currency. You could also deposit the USDC on Ethereum into your Circle Account and withdraw the corresponding amount of USDC on Avalanche to an Avalanche external address.","links":"https://fuse.io/","market_cap":110729,"market_cap_rank":7305,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/stargate-bridged-usdc-fuse/logo.png","detail_platform":{"fuse":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0xc6bc407706b7140ee8eef2f86f9504651b63e7f9","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/fuse/tokens/0xc6bc407706b7140ee8eef2f86f9504651b63e7f9"}}}
