{"name":"Rogue","id":"rogue_arbitrum-one","symbol":"rogue","description":"Rogue Trader is a provably-fair & peer-to-peer DeFi betting platform that runs on its own lightning-fast blockchain, Rogue Chain, all powered by the Rogue token which is the native gas token of the chain. Players enjoy zero house edge on our games, pay zero fees on winnings and there are zero spreads. All winning bets are paid out instantly on-chain into the player's own self-custodial wallet from the game smart contract. All bets are placed in ROGUE tokens against the peer-to-peer house bankroll smart contract which anyone can deposit ROGUE into to act as the house. All game results are provably-fair and posted on-chain in real-time. Players can bet manually on the Rogue Index or they can deposit ROGUE into any one of 30 RogueBots, our autonomous and self-custodial betting bots that bet 24/7 with user funds on the Rogue Index. Each RogueBot is actually a liquidity pool smart contract, ensuring that players can withdraw their funds from the bot at any time.","links":"https://roguetrader.io","market_cap":868581,"market_cap_rank":3910,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/rogue/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x88b8d272b9f1bab7d7896f5f88f8825ce14b05bd","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/arbitrum/tokens/0x88b8d272b9f1bab7d7896f5f88f8825ce14b05bd"}},"is_native":false}
