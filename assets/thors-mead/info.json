{"name":"Thors Mead","id":"thors-mead","symbol":"mead","description":"Asgard is a decentralized reserve currency protocol available on the Avalanche Network. Based on the VOLT token. Each VOLT token is backed by a basket of assets (e.g., DAI, VOLT-DAI LP Tokens) in the Treasury (Odin's Vault) giving it an intrinsic value that it cannot fall below. Asgard also introduces economic and game-theoretic dynamics into the market through forging (Staking) and pledging (Minting). Our goal is to build a policy-controlled currency system, native on the Avalanche Network, that is based on the VOLT token! In the long term, we believe this system can be used to optimize for stability and consistency so that VOLT can function as a relatively stable global unit-of-account and medium-of-exchange currency.","links":"https://asgarddao.fi","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/thors-mead/logo.png"}
