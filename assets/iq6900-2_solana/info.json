{"name":"IQ Labs","id":"iq6900-2_solana","symbol":"iq","description":"IQ Labs (Ticker: IQ) created a new way to put data on the blockchain that’s 2,000× cheaper than existing methods without compression, which sets it apart from all other methods. This new method is called code-in. This means uploading data to the blockchain is now affordable. People can send and receive more complex data fully on-chain, turning the blockchain into a real internet layer. Most so-called Web3 dapps don’t really use blockchain much because gas fees for data are too expensive. As a result, they didn’t build rich on-chain features. But the true Web3 should go beyond just buying and selling assets. With the code-in method, it's possible to build pure on-chain systems: file uploads, chat, databases, online boards, and assets: the internet as you know it — but now on-chain. All our team members come from the IQ Community. The IQ Community is made up of people who love the code-in system and are working together to create new technology and applications on top of it.","links":"https://iqlabs.dev/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/iq6900-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"3uXACfojUrya7VH51jVC1DCHq3uzK4A7g469Q954LABS","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/3uXACfojUrya7VH51jVC1DCHq3uzK4A7g469Q954LABS"}},"is_native":false}
