{"name":"moSOLID","id":"mosolid","symbol":"mosolid","description":"moSOLID is a tokenized, liquid representation of veSOLID -- Solidly base-layer's veNFT. Longer Description: A tokenized version of veSOLID, moSOLID, is returned to the user at a 1:1 rate. MONOLITH automatically converts rebased SOLID into moSOLID proportional to the users staked amount. If a user deposits SOLID into MONOLITH, that SOLID is locked into the MONOLITH veNFT as veSOLID, in exchange-- the user receives proportional moSOLID. moSOLID can be staked into the platform to receive a basket of rewards from the protocol's fees. Rather than staking moSOLID, users can also choose to contribute to the Solidly liquidity pool moSOLID/wETH.","links":"https://alpha.mono.farm","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mosolid/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x848578e351d25b6ec0d486e42677891521c3d743"}}}
