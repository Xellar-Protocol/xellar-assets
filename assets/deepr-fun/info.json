{"name":"Deepr.fun","id":"deepr-fun","symbol":"deepr","description":"A progressive liquidity launchpad. The platform's core feature is a proprietary smart contract system named \"Progressive Liquidity.\" This mechanic launches tokens in sequential stages, or tranches. Following an initial sale, the capital raised is automatically paired with a portion of the project's tokens to form a liquidity pool on a decentralized exchange. As subsequent tranches are purchased by users, the paid capital and the corresponding tokens are automatically and instantly added to this pool. The stated goal of this model is to systematically increase liquidity depth over time, aiming to reduce price volatility and facilitate a fairer token distribution for new assets. The system also incorporates features designed to mitigate the impact of bot activity during launches. The native utility token of the platform is $DEEPR. The platform generates revenue from fees on token launches, with a percentage distributed to the project creators and the remainder allocated to the platform's treasury. Holders of the $DEEPR token are eligible to receive airdrops from select projects that launch on the platform. The $DEEPR token was initiated via a fair launch mechanism, with its initial supply airdropped to community members.","links":"https://deepr.fun/","market_cap":173963,"market_cap_rank":6658,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/deepr-fun/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x086d596d7062b3cdddaaa3714d656508668028fd","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x086d596d7062b3cdddaaa3714d656508668028fd"}}}
