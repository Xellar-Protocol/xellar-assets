{"name":"BoxBet","id":"boxbet","symbol":"bxbt","description":"BoxBet, a decentralized betting bot on Telegram, blends elements from Unibot and stake.com to create a unique, community-driven sports betting space. Central to its design is the BXBT token, functioning as a governance tool while maintaining a deflationary nature through a buy-and-burn approach. Specifically, 30% of projected revenue is dedicated to monthly buy-backs and burns of $BXBT, reinforcing user influence and the project's sustainable growth. Currently in live beta, BoxBet prioritizes user engagement and collective evolution in its development journey.","links":"https://boxbet.io/","market_cap":7088360,"market_cap_rank":2135,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/boxbet/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x33f289d91286535c47270c8479f6776fb3adeb3e"}}}
