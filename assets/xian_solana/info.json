{"name":"Xian","id":"xian_solana","symbol":"xian","description":"Xian is a general-purpose Layer-1 blockchain whose virtual machine runs unmodified Python 3 instead of a domain-specific smart-contract language. Developers deploy contracts with standard Python tooling and libraries, cutting onboarding time from weeks to hours. The native token, $XIAN, secures the network through delegated proof-of-stake, pays execution gas, and participates in a built-in economic loop: 1 % of every contract execution is automatically burned while 68 % of dApp fees are distributed to the contract’s developer, incentivising rapid ecosystem growth and creating continuous deflationary pressure on the circulating supply. Open-source code, a Chrome wallet, a one-click bridge, and SDKs for Python and TypeScript are already live, allowing builders to launch games and DeFi protocols without learning a new language.","links":"https://xian.org","market_cap":42295,"market_cap_rank":8472,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/xian_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"GnaXkbmMV1zGK6bRCQnM9Jd6Jv2Hjw5b2PFVBaKEE5At","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/GnaXkbmMV1zGK6bRCQnM9Jd6Jv2Hjw5b2PFVBaKEE5At"}},"is_native":false}
