{"name":"Evmos","id":"evmos","symbol":"evmos","description":"Evmos is the one of the first Ethereum Virtual Machine-based blockchains in the Cosmos ecosystem and enables developers to launch apps that run smart contracts across any number of EVM and Cosmos-based blockchains. It makes that process as simple and seamless as possible by allowing developers to continue creating apps in Solidity and Vyper like theyâ€™re accustomed to in the Ethereum ecosystem. Evmos opens a new frontier for blockchain applications, expanding the functionality of the EVM by enabling cross-chain applications that tap the liquidity and user bases of multiple blockchain ecosystems to provide more unified experiences.","links":"http://evmos.org/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/evmos/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""},"evmos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd4949664cd82660aae99bedc034a0dea8a0bd517"},"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x93581991f68dbae1ea105233b67f7fa0d6bdee7b"}}}
