{"name":"Evmos","id":"evmos","symbol":"evmos","description":"Evmos is the one of the first Ethereum Virtual Machine-based blockchains in the Cosmos ecosystem and enables developers to launch apps that run smart contracts across any number of EVM and Cosmos-based blockchains. It makes that process as simple and seamless as possible by allowing developers to continue creating apps in Solidity and Vyper like theyâ€™re accustomed to in the Ethereum ecosystem. Evmos opens a new frontier for blockchain applications, expanding the functionality of the EVM by enabling cross-chain applications that tap the liquidity and user bases of multiple blockchain ecosystems to provide more unified experiences.","links":"http://evmos.org/","market_cap":15883336,"market_cap_rank":1556,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/evmos/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
