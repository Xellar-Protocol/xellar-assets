{"name":"Dingo","id":"dingo_solana","symbol":"dingo","description":"Dingo is the first meme coin purchased by Boop.Fun founder Dingaling. Dingo is the first organic cult community slowly growing to be the top meme project launched on Boop.Fun. Launched on Boop.Fun, Dingo lore runs deep and are sometimes referred as Walaku. For example, in some Central Desert communities, the walaku is a key figure in creation narratives, symbolizing survival, adaptability, and connection to the land. It may represent ancestral spirits or serve as a clan emblem, linking people to their ancestors. This lore hits deep with the Dingo project due to the mystery of the dev along with the mysterious support of the Boop.Fun founder.","links":"https://dingoonsolana.com/","market_cap":6528.54,"market_cap_rank":11974,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dingo/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"14jazxRjHyaYsGoFk1u3CZSmgswYginbtTK8Z9PAboop","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/14jazxRjHyaYsGoFk1u3CZSmgswYginbtTK8Z9PAboop"}},"is_native":false}
