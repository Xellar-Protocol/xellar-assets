{"name":"DAI on PulseChain","id":"dai-on-pulsechain","symbol":"dai","description":"DAI on PulseChain is the copied version of DAI on Ethereum, which was part of the worlds largest free airdrop at PulseChain's inception. DAI on PulseChain, or \"pDAI,\" is a speculative future stablecoin which started with zero value and could grow to reach parity with its Ethereum counterpart at $1.00 USD. Copied or \"forked\" contracts from Ethereum on the PulseChain network are experimental. This project seeks to be the first third-party forked token to operate like its original version on the Ethereum network.","links":"https://pulsechaindai.com","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dai-on-pulsechain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"pulsechain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f"}}}
