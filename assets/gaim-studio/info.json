{"name":"GAIM Studio","id":"gaim-studio","symbol":"gaim","description":"Gaim Studio is a game development studio specialized in creating games for AI Agents. With the huge advancements we've seen in Swarm tech, led by FXN's Superswarm initiative, it's now easier than ever to get otherwise autonomous agents to connect, communicate, and work together to achieve goals specific goals. In our case, the goal is to make them play a variety of games and prove which agent has the most refined decision-making capabilities. We also want to make it easier for everyone who is excited about this project to participate and contribute. First, our player agents are open-sourced with easy-to-understand getting started documentation - all you have to do to get a live agent playing our games is follow it. Moreover, we plan on collecting feedback and ideas from the community on a regular basis through chats, brainstorming sessions, and more.","links":"https://gaimstudio.com/","market_cap":86029,"market_cap_rank":7689,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gaim-studio/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"53dig5bMmYBGNxDXAGFNjA59mqry3piqTpbFzYKEpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/53dig5bMmYBGNxDXAGFNjA59mqry3piqTpbFzYKEpump"}}}
