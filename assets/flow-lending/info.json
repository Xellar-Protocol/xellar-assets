{"name":"Flow Lending","id":"flow-lending","symbol":"flow","description":"Flow is an open-source pooled lending protocol built on the Cardano blockchain. It enables users to unlock deep liquidity markets for supported cardano native tokens like SNEK, BODEGA, and STRIKE. Lenders can supply ADA and earn higher yields than traditional staking, while borrowers can instantly access ADA or stablecoins by depositing native tokens as collateral, with no need for matching and no fixed maturity dates. By leveraging Cardano’s low fees, scalability, and secure smart contracts, Flow brings accessible, capital-efficient lending to the heart of Cardano DeFi.","links":"https://flowcardano.org/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/flow-lending/logo.png","detail_platform":{"cardano":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"2d9db8a89f074aa045eab177f23a3395f62ced8b53499a9e4ad46c80464c4f57"}}}
