{"name":"XPowermine.com APOW","id":"xpowermine-com-apow-2_avalanche","symbol":"apow","description":"The APower APOW token is an integral component of the XPower project: They are earned by staking XPower's XPOW tokens, hence representing *aged* XPower rewards. The tokenomics of APOW include a targeted perpetual emission rate, designed to ensure a steady and gradually decreasing inflation rate over time. The token supply dynamics of APOW tokens aim for a perpetual emission model, with a targeted issuance rate of approximately *one token per minute* (i.e. about 525'960 tokens per year). This emission rate results in a decreasing inflation rate over successive years, fostering sustainability and long-term viability. However, the actual supply growth may vary due to the stochastic nature of claiming frequencies. Additionally, the APOW token is intertwined with the XPower NFTs, offering participants the opportunity to stake these NFTs for rewards in the form of APOW tokens. The interest rates for staked NFTs are adaptive, ensuring equitable rewards distribution across different NFT levels. In conclusion, APOW tokens play a vital role in the XPower project, incentivizing participation through staking and contributing to the sustainability and growth of the ecosystem within the Avalanche blockchain.","links":"https://www.xpowermine.com/home","market_cap":306293,"market_cap_rank":5290,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/xpowermine-com-apow-2_avalanche/logo.png","detail_platform":{"avalanche":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf3dd4e0a1db7c5dcbf3b225698cb6a916aeb24d9","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/avax/tokens/0xf3dd4e0a1db7c5dcbf3b225698cb6a916aeb24d9"}},"is_native":false}
