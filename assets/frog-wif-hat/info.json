{"name":"Frog Wif Hat","id":"frog-wif-hat","symbol":"fwif","description":"Le Frog Wif Hat, the epitomé of French meme culture… Fair Launching into a world where it's normal to put hats on animals, Frog With Hat dons a Beret, a staple of French culture. Frog With Hat not only looks fashionable, but also embodies core French values. Always seen with a baguette, often appearing grumpy or drunk, frequently chain-smoking, whilst displaying a deep disdain for those who aren't French, especially Americans. Frog Wif Hat will be a multi-chain token, initially launching on ETH before bridging over to Solana during the second phase of the roadmap. The bridge will leverage portalbridge.com, using a wormhole, a leading cross-chain platform with over $1b TVL (Total Locked Value) currently. Bridging to SOL enables mass adoption, opening the token up to the 2nd biggest meme community.","links":"https://frogwifhattoken.com/en","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/frog-wif-hat/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd298fe9fa71ad553e35997b19af19fb435038521"}}}
