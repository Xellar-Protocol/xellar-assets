{"name":"Speedcash","id":"speedcash","symbol":"scs","description":"Scash is a peer-to-peer decentralized Proof of Stake Velocity digital currency with an initial Proof of Work mining distribution period lasting up to 476,918 coins mined. After the initial mining distribution period is over, the network will transition into an energy efficient Proof of Stake Velocity algorithm which will reward balance holders on the network a 8% staking annual interest. Scash is based on the revolutionary Blockchain concept but has added some very simple and clever layers of communication and a sophisticated off-blockchain coin mixing system making it impossible for 3rd parties to trace transactions between Scash wallets.","links":"http://scash.ml ","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/speedcash/logo.png"}
