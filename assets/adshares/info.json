{"name":"Adshares","id":"adshares","symbol":"ads","description":"Adshares is a Web3 protocol for monetization space in the Metaverse. Adserver platforms allow users to rent space inside Metaverse, blockchain games, NFT exhibitions and websites. Starting in 2017, the team delivered a protocol that is now highly scalable. Adshares is an umbrella project, maintaining a decentralized network. The idea behind the ADS protocol is to give the network to the community with DAO-style governance. In Adshares, anyone can make their own Adserver by implementing open-source blockchain tools in more and more areas. This breakthrough concept allows $ADS holders to take profit from monetization of the protocol. Crypto projects can advertise using a 100% decentralized marketplace. Coins are deflationary due to the native burning and dividend mechanisms. $ADS has its own ultra-fast dPoS blockchain, being also cross-chain to Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and Polygon.","links":"https://adshares.net/","market_cap":16091479,"market_cap_rank":1475,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/adshares/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":11,"contract_address":"0xcfcecfe2bd2fed07a9145222e8a7ad9cf1ccd22a","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xcfcecfe2bd2fed07a9145222e8a7ad9cf1ccd22a"},"base":{"decimal_place":11,"contract_address":"0xb20a4bd059f5914a2f8b9c18881c637f79efb7df","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xb20a4bd059f5914a2f8b9c18881c637f79efb7df"},"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":11,"contract_address":"0x598e49f01befeb1753737934a5b11fea9119c796","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/polygon_pos/tokens/0x598e49f01befeb1753737934a5b11fea9119c796"},"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":11,"contract_address":"0xcfcecfe2bd2fed07a9145222e8a7ad9cf1ccd22a","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xcfcecfe2bd2fed07a9145222e8a7ad9cf1ccd22a"}}}
