{"name":"soup.game","id":"soup-game","symbol":"soup","description":"SOUP is always disappearing. But since scarcity drives value, this can be a beneficial paradigm! To model this, SOUP was created as a deflationary token that disappears at an approximate rate of 2.5% every day. To combat SOUP disappearing, on our website, users can play the SOUP GAME, in which they can stake LP tokens in the Liquidity Pot, stake SOUP tokens in the Single Sided Soup (SSS), or freeze tokens in the Freezer. The Liquidity pot and the SSS come with hearty APRs, while the freezer prevents deflation entirely.","links":"https://soup.game","market_cap":104879,"market_cap_rank":6562,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/soup-game/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x28cfe98c33b8a8bb5f5ac5068a95d9db6bee5ffd","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x28cfe98c33b8a8bb5f5ac5068a95d9db6bee5ffd"}}}
