{"name":"Modulr","id":"modulr_ethereum","symbol":"emdr","description":"Modulr is a global network that lets anyone operate robots anywhere on Earth—instantly, securely, and in real time. Through the Modulr interface, a user can connect to any machine across the world, stream live data, and control it as if they were standing beside it. This ability to bridge distance and bring physical systems online is the foundation of the next global industry. Robotics, AI, data, and compute are converging into a single programmable layer: the Modulr network. Modulr is built around a simple principle: any machine, anywhere, should be operable through a shared network. To make that possible, Modulr provides two key capabilities: 1. Teleoperation at global scale - low-latency, real-time control for robots and connected systems. 2. Open access to intelligence and resources - rent or deploy AI models, data services, and compute directly through the network. Together, these create a practical foundation for the robot-enabled economy, where robotics becomes accessible to both individuals and businesses at scale. Robots are often expensive, challenging to setup for non-developers, and superfluous for long-term ownership. Modulr unlocks access to the world's robots, much like Airbnb unlocks access to the world's vacation spots.","links":"https://modulr.cloud","market_cap":2534429,"market_cap_rank":2719,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/modulr/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x468eabcb5c914ac59e72691f8fc970880a94f4b3","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x468eabcb5c914ac59e72691f8fc970880a94f4b3"}},"is_native":false}
