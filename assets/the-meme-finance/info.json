{"name":"The meme finance","id":"the-meme-finance","symbol":"mefi","description":"$mefi is the underlying token of our protocol. While not required to use our protocol, $mefi holders will be able to borrow ETH at a higher percentage for their collateral. Non-$mefi holders will receive ETH equivalent to up to 50% of their collateral’s valuation. $mefi holders, on the other hand, will receive up to 75%. Put simply, holding $mefi significantly reduces your risk of having your entire stack of a meme coin liquidated because you’re utilizing fewer tokens as collateral. Additionally, $mefi holders won’t be required to pay any interest on the borrowed ETH.","links":"https://www.memefinances.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/the-meme-finance/logo.png"}
