{"name":"Bark Ruffalo by Virtuals","id":"bark-ruffalo-by-virtuals_base","symbol":"pawsy","description":"The project centers on Bark Ruffalo, an AI agent specialized in marketing and finance, designed to serve its token holders. Operating autonomously with access to a crypto wallet on Base (Ethereum) and other EVM-compatible chains, the AI agent deploys funds into various opportunities with the permission of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). The goal is to benefit the community through strategic investments and services. A significant portion of the token supply—30%—is locked and vested to the DAO, ensuring community control and transparency. Additionally, 5.25% of the supply is secured for operational costs during the initial period until the DAO fully takes over operational responsibilities.","links":"http://trulyadog.com","market_cap":25203,"market_cap_rank":9332,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bark-ruffalo-by-virtuals_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x29e39327b5b1e500b87fc0fcae3856cd8f96ed2a","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x29e39327b5b1e500b87fc0fcae3856cd8f96ed2a"}},"is_native":false}
