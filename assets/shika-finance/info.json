{"name":"Shika Finance","id":"shika-finance","symbol":"shika","description":"SHIKA DEX: Shika DEX will be an automated market maker (AMM DEX) decentralized swap on the BNBChain network. It will allow users to swap their tokens – even small amounts – without needing to engage with order books. Prospective traders can make their trades at the best rates with low fees, via a simple and intuitive front-end interface. Users will also have the chance to provide liquidity to the trading pairs on Shika DEX. A significant portion of the trading fees incurred on the Shika DEX will be distributed back to the liquidity pools. Over time, and depending on the trading volume on Shika DEX, this increases the value of the liquidity pool (LP) tokens that providers hold.","links":"https://shika.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/shika-finance/logo.png"}
