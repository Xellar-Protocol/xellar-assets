{"name":"Away From Keyboard","id":"away-from-keyboard","symbol":"afk","description":"Away From Keyboard ($AFK) is a deflationary token on Solana deployed securely via moneyglitch. Every buy/sell/transfer has a 5% tax - 100% of tax is burned from supply permanently. Away From Keyboard ($AFK), a pure tax burn token, offers key advantages over non-deflationary tokens: 1) No reward-based sell pressure, 2) Scarcity increases as supply shrinks, 3) Incentivizes long-term holding, & 4) Your % share of supply grows just by holding. $AFK offers strong deflationary tokenomics backed by a unique brand.","links":"https://earnwhileyouafk.com","market_cap":180924,"market_cap_rank":6585,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/away-from-keyboard/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"9R6qezCXoY5fX8nC7SA4bZ1zHrwG9WnnKVGt1SRoMGF","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/9R6qezCXoY5fX8nC7SA4bZ1zHrwG9WnnKVGt1SRoMGF"}}}
