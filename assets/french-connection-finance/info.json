{"name":"Zypto Token","id":"french-connection-finance","symbol":"zypto","description":"ZYPTO ($ZYPTO) is the native utility token of the Zypto ecosystem, designed as a community-driven crypto payments platform integrating decentralized financial solutions with real-world use cases. Zypto provides users with a comprehensive set of financial tools, including a multi-chain, non-custodial wallet application, built-in token swaps, crypto bill payments, mobile top-ups, physical and virtual crypto spending cards, and enhanced security through Vault Key Card hardware storage. A distinctive feature is Zypto’s Rewards Hub (Zyptopia), which enables $ZYPTO token holders to receive daily loyalty incentives (ZYPs) by registering their tokens within the Zypto app—without the need for traditional staking. These rewards, funded by ecosystem revenue, can immediately be spent on practical utilities such as crypto cards, hardware wallets, mobile top-ups, crypto-based bill payments, and various forthcoming services. Governed by the Zypto Foundation, the ecosystem emphasizes transparency and community involvement. It leverages transaction fees and token trade revenue to sustain rewards, ongoing development, and ecosystem expansion, directly benefiting token holders.","links":"https://zypto.com","market_cap":5059463,"market_cap_rank":2346,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/french-connection-finance/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x7a65cb87f596caf31a4932f074c59c0592be77d7","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x7a65cb87f596caf31a4932f074c59c0592be77d7"}}}
