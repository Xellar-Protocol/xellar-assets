{"name":"SwarmNode.ai","id":"swarmnode-ai_solana","symbol":"snai","description":"SwarmNode enables running AI agents in the cloud without managing servers. An agent can be executed via the UI, REST API and Python SDK. Agents can invoke each other and act as a swarm. After an agent finishes its task, it hibernates and waits for the next task. An agent can also process data, store it in a shared database and let other agents pick it up and process it further. SwarmNode aims to be a one-stop shop for creating, configuring and deploying AI agents.","links":"https://swarmnode.ai/","market_cap":1322663,"market_cap_rank":3411,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/swarmnode-ai_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"Hjw6bEcHtbHGpQr8onG3izfJY5DJiWdt7uk2BfdSpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/Hjw6bEcHtbHGpQr8onG3izfJY5DJiWdt7uk2BfdSpump"}},"is_native":false}
