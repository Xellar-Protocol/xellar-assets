{"name":"Futura","id":"futura","symbol":"futura","description":"The dynamic liquidity feature automatically gives a higher LP % as MC rises, and lower LP % as MC lowers. We have the power to automatically or manually rebalance the LP/MC ratio. In any event of becoming liquified occurs - this is where the true magic of Futura happens. The whole idea is to get the LP as large as possible to be a weapon. We can then rebalance it and control the ratio. With the lp we can pull it, buyback/burn it with no impact to the price. No selling required, no price damage, perfect execution..","links":"https://www.futuratoken.com","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/futura/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x26487ec318b0138dcf6cd1f43ee68927756dbc1d"}}}
