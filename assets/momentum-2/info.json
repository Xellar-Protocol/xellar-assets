{"name":"Momentum","id":"momentum-2","symbol":"mass","description":"Momentum is a distinctive DeFi staking platform on the Binance Smart Chain, designed for holders of MASS tokens to stake them seamlessly into the Singularity. This innovative system enables participants to generate weekly passive income rewards from multiple sources, including trading bot strategies, validator nodes, bitcoin mining, gold trading, and more. What sets Momentum apart is its ability to provide access to these profitable streams through staking a liquid and taxless token, like the MASS token, rather than being locked into an NFT or staking period. This flexibility is a key feature of the platform. Originally starting as a DeFi project with taxes and a unique token stabilizer, Momentum has since evolved, focusing on its core Singularity staking solution. By partnering with various projects and communities, Momentum continuously expands its holdings in profitable ventures to generate rewards for Singularity stakers. The MASS token, free from taxes, allows holders to stake any amount into the Singularity contract and earn their share of the rewards, further solidifying Momentum's commitment to providing a flexible and accessible staking platform.","links":"https://www.momentumproject.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/momentum-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe81a79e9d951759aef3fccef17022276b3a0c7e5"}}}
