{"name":"Saiyan Inu","id":"saiyan-inu","symbol":"sayan","description":"Saiyan Inu is a DeFi Token with deflationary tokenomics. Saiyan Inu features an automated liquidity acquisition yield farm contract. The seller tax is 10%, punishing the seller and rewarding the holders. The Developer and his team are doxxed and a full audit has been carried out. The purpose of the token is based around an NFT trading card game. NFT trading cards will be released weekly and will encourage holders to collect. A trading card battle game is in development which will integrate the NFT’s into the game itself. There will be NFT lootboxes available for purchase with SAYAN which adds a further element of fun into the token plus further deflationary mechanics. The long term goal is for Saiyan Inu to bring out the Trading Hub, which will allow users to buy/trade NFT’s using the SAYAN currency. With every purchase or sell of said NFT’s a portion will be burned. Giving SAYAN a strong use case and adding an additional deflationary model to the token.","links":"https://saiyaninu.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/saiyan-inu/logo.png"}
