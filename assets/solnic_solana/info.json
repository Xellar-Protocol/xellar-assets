{"name":"Solnic","id":"solnic_solana","symbol":"solnic","description":"The Solnic project represents a Solana-based meme coin that was introduced approximately nine months ago, combining elements of popular culture with cryptocurrency. Solnic merges the iconic imagery of Sonic the Hedgehog with Pepe the Frog, creating a unique token that resonates with fans of both franchises, as well as crypto enthusiasts. Despite its meme coin status, Solnic prides itself on robust community engagement and has implemented locked liquidity, which is designed to instill trust by ensuring that the liquidity pool cannot be altered, thereby theoretically stabilizing the token's price and reducing the risk of rug pulls. This approach suggests a longer-term commitment from its creators and community, aiming to build a sustainable project within the volatile landscape of meme coins on the Solana blockchain.","links":"https://www.solniccoin.io","market_cap":1411642,"market_cap_rank":3347,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/solnic_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"DeaKMzAeZja3Mh5okZE6WUvygLP3Lfuvm6Rg78HqXTz9","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/DeaKMzAeZja3Mh5okZE6WUvygLP3Lfuvm6Rg78HqXTz9"}},"is_native":false}
