More details: https://docs.harborprotocol.one/harbor-protocol What makes your project unique? Harbor Protocol enables minting of stablecoin CMST with a wide range of interchain assets by opening CDPs. HARBOR tokenomics is unique and inspired by Andre Conje ve(3,3) model. Tokenomics blog: https://blog.comdex.one/understanding-harbor-tokenomics-bf092eb50285 History of your project.

Whatâ€™s next for your project? Next in Harbor protocol there will Liquity styled vaults which will enable minting of stable coins at lower collateral ratios of 110% which will improve the capital efficiency of the users. What can your token be used for? HARBOR tokens are used for; 1. Governance of the Harbor protocol which sets CR ration, Drawdown fees etc for different vaults. 2. Recapitalisation, the HARBOR tokens are used to maintain the CMST peg under specific market conditions. 3. Rewards, HARBOR tokens are given to veharbor stakers and to vault owners as emissions.
