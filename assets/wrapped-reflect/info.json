{"name":"Wrapped REFLECT","id":"wrapped-reflect","symbol":"wrft","description":"REFLECT is a synthetic token designed with the clear purpose of unifying individual game tokens to facilitate an inter-game economy within the WEMIX PLAY gaming ecosystem. RFT functions as a catalyst that influences the trade volume for all REFLECT Alliance game tokens by implementing a unique RFT minting procedure which requires an equivalent number of game tokens to be deposited into the Fusion Center, a process also known as Fusion. In addition, RFT is a new form of game token Airdrop, where holders of RFT automatically become eligible to claim brand new tokens of games that onboard WEMIX PLAY in the future. RFT fuses elements of Gaming and Finance to create a brand new GameFi utility token devised to impact the macroeconomy of the gaming ecosystem by merging the microeconomy of individual games on WEMIX PLAY. RFT will become the foundation in the evolution of tokenomics for future games by demonstrating the importance of interconnected game economy and its influence towards collective growth.","links":"https://wemix.com","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wrapped-reflect/logo.png","detail_platform":{"wemix-network":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x2B58644b9f210ebB8fBF4C27066f9d1d97B03CBc/txs"}}}
