{"name":"Engrave Protocol","id":"engrave-protocol_solana","symbol":"engrave","description":"Engrave Protocol is an MCP-based service designed to provide AI agents and automated applications with real-time, reliable access to Bitcoin blockchain data. Instead of relying on traditional API keys or monthly subscription plans, Engrave uses the x402 Payment Protocol, where every request is authenticated and settled via USDC micropayments on the Solana network. This “pay-per-request” model makes the platform highly flexible and cost-efficient, allowing developers to query mempool activity, transaction details, fee conditions, UTXO data, and more—while paying only for what they actually use. Responses are returned in a structured, agent-ready format, making Engrave ideal for AI tools, trading bots, analytics systems, and automated workflows that rely on accurate blockchain data. Engrave Protocol offers a modern, streamlined alternative to traditional blockchain data providers by removing fixed costs, eliminating credential management, and enabling instant, frictionless access through on-chain micropayments.","links":"https://engrave-protocol.ai/","market_cap":207976,"market_cap_rank":5852,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/engrave-protocol_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"ADMiFUmFUz3tzLozh7yTy2zWe1soM61aE995TZqLpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/ADMiFUmFUz3tzLozh7yTy2zWe1soM61aE995TZqLpump"}},"is_native":false}
