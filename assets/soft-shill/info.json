{"name":"soft shill","id":"soft-shill","symbol":"coded","description":"$CODED is more than just a meme token — it’s an autonomous digital entity that lives and breathes in the developer-coded world of X (formerly Twitter). At its core, $CODED is a reactive bot-driven token that automatically replies to posts with a cryptic but iconic phrase: “it’s $coded.” Like a mysterious developer lurking in the shadows, it shows up uninvited, unannounced, and undeniably present. The project is built around a core identity that celebrates coding culture, automation, and the quiet power of lines of logic. Just like how good code doesn’t explain itself — it runs — $CODED doesn’t argue or shill. It simply responds. Instantly. Relentlessly. When someone drops alpha, makes a genius move, or unknowingly touches brilliance, the $CODED bot shows up to seal it with approval: “it’s $coded.” It feels like an easter egg for insiders — and a riddle for everyone else.","links":"https://coded.review/","market_cap":489315,"market_cap_rank":4492,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/soft-shill/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"GTc5QQbZSf7W3CpvwqFkWXjPwRhYds8R8iJyR3e7pump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/GTc5QQbZSf7W3CpvwqFkWXjPwRhYds8R8iJyR3e7pump"}}}
