{"name":"Edwin","id":"edwin_solana","symbol":"edwin","description":"Edwin is on a mission to democratize DeFAI (Decentralized Finance AI) by building the essential infrastructure that bridges artificial intelligence with decentralized finance. The project provides a unified, secure interface that enables AI agents to interact with any DeFi protocol, abstracting away the complexity of blockchain operations and protocol-specific implementations. Through standardized actions and protocol abstractions, Edwin creates a foundation where AI agents can execute sophisticated financial strategies across multiple protocols and chains. We envision a future where autonomous AI agents can seamlessly interact with DeFi protocols, creating a new paradigm of intelligent, efficient, and accessible financial services. This infrastructure is designed to be open-source and community-driven, ensuring that the benefits of DeFAI are accessible to all developers and users who want to participate in this revolutionary convergence of AI and DeFi.","links":"https://edwin.finance/","market_cap":531241,"market_cap_rank":4507,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/edwin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"GPrg1CgbBvAJS2SCuf9gF7NmQYsWudfyfWy5SUzypump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/GPrg1CgbBvAJS2SCuf9gF7NmQYsWudfyfWy5SUzypump"}},"is_native":false}
