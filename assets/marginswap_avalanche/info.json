{"name":"Marginswap","id":"marginswap_avalanche","symbol":"mfi","description":"Marginswap is a decentralized trading protocol that natively supports overcollateralized loans, spot and leverage trading of tokens on AMMs like Uniswap and SushiSwap. With Marginswap, traders can trade a wide variety of assets, like on any existing swap protocol but with up to 5x leverage. Margin trading is possible due to Bond lending, i.e., lenders supply crypto assets to the protocol, which traders borrow for their trades.","links":"https://marginswap.finance/","market_cap":91280,"market_cap_rank":7154,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/marginswap/logo.png","detail_platform":{"avalanche":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x9fda7ceec4c18008096c2fe2b85f05dc300f94d0","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/avax/tokens/0x9fda7ceec4c18008096c2fe2b85f05dc300f94d0"}},"is_native":false}
