{"name":"Deenar Gold","id":"deenar-gold","symbol":"deen","description":"Deenar Gold (DEEN) is a Sharia-compliant digital token, fully backed by physical gold, where each token represents one gram of gold securely stored by Brinks, a global leader in vault and logistics services. This ensures that every token holder owns a tangible, allocated portion of physical gold, providing a transparent and stable store of value. Built on the HAQQ Network, a blockchain designed to meet Islamic finance principles, DEEN combines modern blockchain technology with the traditional value of gold. It offers a secure, halal solution for Muslims and other ethically-minded investors seeking to preserve and grow wealth in a manner that aligns with Islamic law. With the backing of physical gold and compliance with Sharia standards, Deenar provides a unique financial tool that bridges the gap between ethical investing and the advantages of blockchain, such as transparency, instant transfers, and decentralized ownership.","links":"https://deenar.com/","market_cap":313503,"market_cap_rank":4087,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/deenar-gold/logo.png","detail_platform":{"haqq-network":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0x4febdde47ab9a76200e57efcc80b212a07b3e6ce"},"osmosis":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":"ibc/108604FDBE97DAEF128FD4ECFEB2A8AFC2D04A7162C97EAA2FD5BCB0869D0BBC"}}}
