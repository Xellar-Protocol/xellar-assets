{"name":"Xuez Coin","id":"xuez","symbol":"xuez","description":"XUEZ is a privacy-focused, internet-based cryptocurrency community project with an exceptionally fast payment confirmations protocol. Our efforts concentrate on reestablishing Satoshi Nakamoto's original vision while simultaneously creating a future-forward model that others will look to as a benchmark. Furthermore, XUEZ intends to propose a series of specific improvements to the Bitcoin architecture that will result in a much stronger and more anonymous, decentralised cryptocurrency. Through these modifications, XUEZ aims to build a platform that will be capable of facilitating the completely private and encrypted transfer of information in the form of electronic messages, files, and assets. XUEZ is a peer to peer electronic asset protocol deployed throughout the internet. The XUEZ protocol was developed to address the inherent problems plaguing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, whilst still ensuring the ability to protect anonymity and expand usability. XUEZ provides a 8MB block size that results in virtually instantaneous transaction times. Additionally, XUEZ aims to implement and provide several decentralized anonymous services that will further serve to deliver on the promise of an anonymous and utilizable cryptocurrency.","links":"http://www.xuezcoin.com","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/xuez/logo.png"}
