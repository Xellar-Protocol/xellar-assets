{"name":"Pairs","id":"pairs_ethereum","symbol":"pairs","description":"Pairs is building what we believe will be the first profit-sharing decentralized exchange (DEX), merging the best of decentralized finance (DeFi) with the compliance and reliability of centralized finance (CeFi). Our goal is to offer a single platform where users can trade digital assets across chains, seamlessly convert them into real-world currencies (and vice versa), and directly participate in the platform’s revenue. This document walks you through our vision for Pairs—from the technological foundations that enable streamlined cross-chain trading to the profit-sharing framework that puts value back into the hands of our community. We’re excited to share how we aim to redefine what it means to participate in a decentralized exchange.","links":"https://pairs.xyz/","market_cap":223273,"market_cap_rank":5744,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pairs/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xfb70859efec2ceb84dd4935a0842aa69290020bc","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xfb70859efec2ceb84dd4935a0842aa69290020bc"}},"is_native":false}
