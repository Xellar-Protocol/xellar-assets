{"name":"Victory Gem","id":"victory-gem_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"vtg","description":"VTG is a token on the Binance Smart Chain. You can earn VTG by playing competitive multiplayer games on nWayPlay, and in turn use VTG earned to buy NFTs that offer in-game utility. The first game to utilize VTG is Olympic Games Jam: Beijing 2022 (OGJ), a cross-play party game on Android and iOS, where up to 20 players compete in real-time through a series of chaotic mini-games until one champion emerges. Olympic Games Jam: Paris 2024 is under development and will also be using the VTG token to enable P2E functionality. Both Olympic Games Jam: Beijing 2022 and Olympic Games Jam: Paris 2024 are officially licensed from the International Olympic Committee (IOC).","links":"https://victorygem.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/victory-gem/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8de5aa37a7c40a53062ead382b8eead3b08a7a46","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x8de5aa37a7c40a53062ead382b8eead3b08a7a46"}},"is_native":false}
