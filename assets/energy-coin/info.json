{"name":"ENERGY COIN","id":"energy-coin","symbol":"energy","description":"ENERGY COIN is a community-driven meme token inspired by the concept of “monetary energy,” as popularized by Michael Saylor. The project explores the idea that all value—financial or symbolic—is a form of energy stored and transferred through networks. ENERGY COIN exists on-chain as a decentralized digital asset without a roadmap, utility, or promise of return. It serves as a cultural experiment and memetic artifact within the crypto ecosystem. The token has no intrinsic value and is intended for entertainment and expressive purposes only.","links":"https://www.ticker.energy/","market_cap":57889,"market_cap_rank":8287,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/energy-coin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"HjsZ73QxNbXoUnyXXffoXn6kHUKQqdy6GXd4J1N4shot","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/HjsZ73QxNbXoUnyXXffoXn6kHUKQqdy6GXd4J1N4shot"}}}
