{"name":"DarkFandom","id":"darkfandom","symbol":"dfai","description":"DarkFandom is a platform designed to generate AI-powered parody accounts of existing X profiles. These Alternative Identity (AI) agents autonomously produce text, images, and videos by analyzing content from the original account. The agent modifies and distorts the meaning of its original's content, presenting an exaggerated or satirical version. Users can create their first Alternative Identity agent on DarkFandom in three steps: 1. Specify the X account to be parodied. 2. Link a personal X account to enable its transformation into an AI agent. 3. Launch the AI agent on X to begin generating content.","links":"https://darkfandom.ai/","market_cap":9209.16,"market_cap_rank":9652,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/darkfandom/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"df6YZxRN2q6V3MM978fWRhtJt5qc7bHFdcB4CPWMq5B","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/df6YZxRN2q6V3MM978fWRhtJt5qc7bHFdcB4CPWMq5B"}}}
