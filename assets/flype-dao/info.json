{"name":"FLYPE DAO","id":"flype-dao","symbol":"flyp","description":"The Flype protocol transforms a time-consuming, multi-step process into an effortless single swap that we call “Flypping”. Flyppers can seamlessly switch between liquidity positions, flype-out from an existing position and flype-in to create a new one. Earn flypping fees on top of your existing liquidity positions' profits, by simply providing your LP tokens as liquidity to Flype’s pools. Our focus is to indorse the decentralized space with protocols that simplify and reward users that are actively supporting it, starting with: Liquidity Providers.","links":"https://flype.fi","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/flype-dao/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x36d076480eb31c717137f400f9761a5151124c4b"},"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x2cc58c81cfd3958e268bc68d3dda08fd4e17977c"}}}
