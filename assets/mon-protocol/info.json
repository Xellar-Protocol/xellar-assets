{"name":"MON Protocol","id":"mon-protocol","symbol":"mon","description":"MON Protocol is The Publishing Protocol of Web3. The $MON Token is an ERC-20 fungible token that will be used to power and govern fractionalized IP ecosystems, starting with the Pixelmon gaming ecosystem. To grow into this vision and role, $MON token will first be applied to the Pixelmon IP, which is an NFT native gaming-focused IP. $MON will be the IP protocol of the Pixelmon IP, combining functions of: - A gaming token (for example as in-game currency purchase, special skins access, tournament prizes and entry ticket,) - Governance over the IP of Pixelmon’s 214 unique monsters and governance over the Ecosystem Fund used to grow the IP and acquire gamers to play the games - Powering the royalty payments to Pixelmon NFT holders who have legal fractional ownership of their Monster’s image In addition to its launch partnership with Pixelmon - which will adopt MON token as the game currency and governance token - the MON Protocol is official partner with the main web3 gaming studios, including: Chronoforge, Blockgames, Revolving Games, Delabs, Playember, Nyan Heroes, Ambrus Studio, Endless Cloud, Gam3sgg, Karate Combat, Mintify and more. The Pixelmon IP and games are the launch partners of MON with MON de facto being the ecosystem token of Pixelmon and all its games. With 3 games launching this year and a 6-digit engaged community of fans and players, coupled with the most traded NFT gaming collection globally, Pixelmon is a powerhouse IP for MON to launch on.","links":"https://www.monprotocol.ai/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mon-protocol/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
