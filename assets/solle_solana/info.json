{"name":"SOLLE","id":"solle_solana","symbol":"solle","description":"Solle is the unofficial mascot of the Solana Network, designed to engage the community by simplifying blockchain concepts and sharing Solana-related insights across social platforms. Acting as a playful bridge between technical knowledge and the degen community, Solle brings an approachable and entertaining voice to the ecosystem. The token itself carries no intrinsic utility or function and exists purely as a community-driven project and cultural symbol.","links":"https://www.solleonsol.com/","market_cap":61723,"market_cap_rank":7852,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/solle/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"Eyc4ozMWwUxBUTK61MTjzLBjSWWWNqqc8sjTF3Gfbonk","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/Eyc4ozMWwUxBUTK61MTjzLBjSWWWNqqc8sjTF3Gfbonk"}},"is_native":false}
