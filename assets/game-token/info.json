{"name":"GAME Token","id":"game-token","symbol":"game","description":"$GAME is building a next-generation blockchain gaming ecosystem where players, creators, and developers thrive together in a shared economy. At its core, the project is about decentralizing ownership, incentivizing contribution, and enabling anyone to earn through meaningful participation. Players gain true ownership of in-game assets, which can be traded, upgraded, or used across multiple games. Players also earn $GAME tokens by playing, competing, or streaming gameplay—turning time and skill into real value. Content Creators can monetize their influence by hosting events, streaming gameplay, producing guides or content, and earning direct community support and $GAME incentives. Game Makers can fund development through ecosystem grants, fair launch contributions, and direct token sales. They also benefit from shared infrastructure, open-source tooling, and a ready player base within the ecosystem. Asset Owners can create, trade, or lease in-game assets such as skins, items, and land, and earn passive income as their assets are used and appreciated by the community. Every action in the $GAME ecosystem—whether playing, building, sharing, or investing—is rewarded, making it one of the most dynamic and aligned economies in Web3 gaming.","links":"https://game.ar.io","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/game-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
