{"name":"401jK","id":"401jk_solana","symbol":"401jk","description":"The 401jk (just kidding) meme is a satirical punch in the gut in the face of the concept of retirement and also the 401k. The 401k total holdings are valued at around $12 trillion USD and it is the most popular retirement savings plan in the US. As time passes forevermore true retirement, or as we like to call it real freedom will only become much harder and harder for people to attain. Through meme fueled laser focus and cyperphunk ideology the 401jK meme retirement fund token and community aim to point out the absurdities of how rigged our current system is, and how only insiders and those with power are starting the benefit from the increased centralization of cryptocurrency.........while also aiming to flip the $12 trillion USD 401k system to achieve freedom before our backs and knees are breaking.","links":"https://401jk.fun/","market_cap":8650639,"market_cap_rank":1668,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/401jk/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"Cz7LGKdZPpAxonXx23ZYPW3RtDQvjcf17ZDCZEzFpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/Cz7LGKdZPpAxonXx23ZYPW3RtDQvjcf17ZDCZEzFpump"}},"is_native":false}
