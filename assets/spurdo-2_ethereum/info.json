{"name":"Spurdo","id":"spurdo-2_ethereum","symbol":"spurdo","description":"Spurdo is a meme-based ERC-20 token launched on the Ethereum blockchain. It draws inspiration from Spurdo Spärde, a meme character originating from Finnish internet culture in the late 2000s. The project does not offer utility beyond community-driven engagement and meme value. Spurdo is structured as a decentralized, zero-tax, fair-launch token with a renounced contract, aimed at preserving the spirit of early internet and imageboard humor.","links":"https://spurdoeth.com/","market_cap":14493.42,"market_cap_rank":10432,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/spurdo-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x42069e779838929495ed0152ffc27145ce5c7f98","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x42069e779838929495ed0152ffc27145ce5c7f98"}},"is_native":false}
