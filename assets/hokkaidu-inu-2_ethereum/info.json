{"name":"Hokkaidu Inu","id":"hokkaidu-inu-2_ethereum","symbol":"hokk","description":"Hokkaidu Inu (HOKK) is a community-driven cryptocurrency project built on the Ethereum blockchain. Inspired by the popular Inu movement, it represents cultural storytelling through the theme of a Shiba warrior who has endured multiple cycles of the crypto market. The token emphasizes decentralization and transparency, with its smart contract renounced, liquidity permanently burned, and a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens. Hokkaidu Inu does not provide hidden mechanisms or developer advantages; instead, it is designed to embody resilience, community ownership, and long-term cultural relevance within the meme coin ecosystem.","links":"https://www.hokkaiduinu.xyz","market_cap":45125,"market_cap_rank":8373,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/hokkaidu-inu-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x4f2cef6f39114ade3d8af4020fa1de1d064cadaf","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x4f2cef6f39114ade3d8af4020fa1de1d064cadaf"}},"is_native":false}
