{"name":"APO","id":"apo","symbol":"apo","description":"Apollon is a decentralized debt protocol developed by BLKSWN PTE. LTD., enabling the creation and management of synthetic assets (aAssets) backed by overcollateralized vaults. Users can lock selected ERC-20 tokens as collateral and issue aAssets such as aUSD, aNVDA, or aTSLA. The protocol maintains a minimum individual collateralization ratio (IMCR) of min. 110%, enforced by smart contracts. aAssets are freely transferable and are burned upon repayment of debt. The protocol includes a liquidation mechanism based on a redistributive logic to handle undercollateralized positions. The aUSD stablecoin is redeemable for collateral at face value, helping to maintain its peg. Apollon integrates the decentralized Pyth Network for real-time price oracles. The system also includes automated swap functionality via an integrated DEX, allowing users to open long or short positions and provide liquidity while automatically managing associated debts.","links":"https://www.apollon.fi/","market_cap":210112,"market_cap_rank":6368,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/apo/logo.png","detail_platform":{"sei-v2":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x5b8203e65aa5be3f1cf53fd7fa21b91ba4038ecc","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/sei-evm/tokens/0x5b8203e65aa5be3f1cf53fd7fa21b91ba4038ecc"}}}
