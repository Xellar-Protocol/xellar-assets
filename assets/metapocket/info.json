{"name":"MetaPocket","id":"metapocket","symbol":"mpckt","description":"MetaBoards (the gaming ecosystem of Pocket) is a table-top board game on Arbitrum, fully randomized by Chainlink VRF2. It offers players a unique gaming experience with numerous ways of being rewarded in a fully on-chain board game. With a built-in vault, a reimagined miner, rewards points, exclusive NFTs, and so much more. MetaBoards started in 2021 as Memenopoly and has since rebranded. In 2022 Memenopoly and Pocket merged projects to create MetaBoards, which incorporates 2+ years of experience and development, and migrated 3 projects into one token, MPCKT. MPCKT is the in-game currency of Metaboards and the Pocket ecosystem. With six boards available to play, each with their own NFTs, and in full VR, there is something for everybody. In addition to The Boards, the platform offers NFT Locking for rewards, a vault, a miner, and NFT Store, LP farming, and so much more. The MetaBoards ecosystem will be updated to include Squads, previously on Polygon, an NFT based football (soccer) game, with more games currently in development. Additionally, Pocket will be launching their Freelance for Crypto platform in the near future, providing a safe and secure way to locate and review the services that Web3 projects need.","links":"https://app.metaboards.games","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/metapocket/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd1c533a00548dd9c1e7b0f8ea834f65383b116de"}}}
