{"name":"Galeon","id":"galeon","symbol":"galeon","description":"What Is GALEON? In 2016, Galeon cofounders decided to create the next generation of Electronic Health Record (EHR) as a healthcare cloud that links hospitals on a territorial scale, up to a country. The genesis of Galeon is the result of collaboration with several hundred caregivers who helped Galeon to create the platform. Imagine a collaborative World, where everyone can contribute by sharing their medical data anonymously and securely for the good of Humanity. A world where everyone could help eradicate diseases and work together to build a better future for the new generations. What makes GALEON unique? Galeon connects patients, caregivers, hospitals, researchers and innovators around a common goal : Share medical data for the good of Humanity. All hospitals working with Galeon contribute to build the biggest structured healthcare data lake of Humanity. All participants (hospitals and patients) are rewarded for their contribution to the research network with our DAO. The collaborative and decentralized aspect at the heart of Blockchain technology is part of Galeonâ€™s DNA. 50% of the value generated thanks to the research network will go to the DAO treasury in order to fund non-profit projects. Patients and Token Holders of $GALEON will decide which project will be founded. GALEON token is at the center of Galeon Healthcare Ecosystem. Together, We Make a Change.","links":"https://www.galeon.care/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/galeon/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x1d0ac23f03870f768ca005c84cbb6fb82aa884fd"}}}
