{"name":"Haven","id":"haven-2_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"haven","description":"Haven is a decentralized platform that enables robotic simulations and experimentation through digital twin models. It provides a virtual environment where users can create, test, and execute robotic tasks without needing physical hardware. Users can interact with robots using either programming languages or natural language commands, allowing both technical and non-technical participants to explore and validate robotic behaviors. The simulation engine incorporates physics-based movement and object interaction to produce realistic outcomes suitable for research, prototyping, and educational use. The platform also supports a tokenized ecosystem in which robot deployment and usage can be tracked and incentivized.","links":"https://haven.science/","market_cap":1642.42,"market_cap_rank":13061,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/haven-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x3c06af089f1188c8357b29bdf9f98b36e51f7690","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x3c06af089f1188c8357b29bdf9f98b36e51f7690"}},"is_native":false}
