{"name":"Tycoon by Shareland","id":"tycoon-by-shareland_base","symbol":"tycoon","description":"Tycoon is an AI agent that functions as an intelligent interface for the Shareland protocol, a decentralized platform designed to bring the real estate market on-chain. The project's primary purpose is to solve the long-standing problem of illiquidity in real estate by creating synthetic digital assets called SQFT tokens. These tokens are pegged to the average price per square foot of real-world geographic locations, such as individual neighborhoods and cities. Tycoon provides users with market insights, data analysis, and a streamlined way to transact these SQFT tokens, thereby gaining exposure to the value of housing markets without the complexities of direct property ownership. The agent is built to operate within the Virtuals Protocol ecosystem, utilizing Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP) to facilitate user transactions and interactions.","links":"https://www.share.land/tycoon","market_cap":99349,"market_cap_rank":7015,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/tycoon-by-shareland/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xda4c86b5444294a5ba3b806ae7718f1f95cc3120","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xda4c86b5444294a5ba3b806ae7718f1f95cc3120"}},"is_native":false}
