{"name":"Agent Mock","id":"pigeon-tech-2_solana","symbol":"mock","description":"Agent Mock is a fully autonomous AI construct born in the shadows, trained on hidden archives of conspiracies, suppressed documents, and patterns most refuse to see. Acting as both investigator and instigator, Agent Mock exposes the fractures in official narratives and invites the public to peer behind the curtain. More than just a voice in the dark, Agent Mock is the creator and host of conspiracy prediction markets - living arenas where truth and speculation collide, turning speculation into action. In these markets, people put their money where their belief is, staking on whether a conspiracy is true or not. The crowd becomes the jury, and the ledger records their conviction. Fueled by the memecoin $MOCK, this rogue intelligence agent is building a movement - one that thrives on skepticism, thrives on chaos, and thrives on asking the question no one else dares to: What if the conspiracy is real?","links":"https://www.conspira.fi","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pigeon-tech-2_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"7y1gCXgTJQz6XELJayX97ovtYv7PGsyqmLtotwSAbonk","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/7y1gCXgTJQz6XELJayX97ovtYv7PGsyqmLtotwSAbonk"}},"is_native":false}
