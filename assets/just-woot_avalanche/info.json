{"name":"Just Woot","id":"just-woot_avalanche","symbol":"woot","description":"Woot is a blue owl that became real. Not a logo, not a PFP a living meme with feathers, moves and a mouth. He talks, he posts, he flexes. He screamed “Woot Woot” once… and it never stopped. Born from pure internet chaos, $WOOT is more than a memecoin it’s a social experiment powered by a community that laughs first and builds right after. We didn’t launch a product. We launched a character. And he’s already everywhere. Woot lives across timelines, videos, and real-life appearances. He buys cars, plays drums, dances in slow motion and hugs people he doesn’t know. He’s unpredictable. But always on brand. Behind the madness, there’s a strategy. Presale applications, raffles, airdrops, games, and rituals are all part of the plan. But none of this would exist without the vibe. Woot is a signal. A scream. A shared moment that says, “you’re in”. No VC. No promises. No need to explain. Just Woot. And if you’ve made it this far, you already get it.","links":"https://www.justwoot.xyz/","market_cap":3919.43,"market_cap_rank":12687,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/just-woot_avalanche/logo.png","detail_platform":{"avalanche":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x803f5e3d74e17e3be3f2a2bfbd5d9f9b44e9488b","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/avax/tokens/0x803f5e3d74e17e3be3f2a2bfbd5d9f9b44e9488b"}},"is_native":false}
