{"name":"Meme Dollar","id":"meme-dollar","symbol":"pina","description":"$Pina is an essential part of our dual-coin system, serving as a utility token that drives activity and innovation on our platform. By incentivizing artists to “drop” their artworks, promoting community collaborations, and rewarding participation in games and staking, $Pina helps to support and grow our NFT marketplace. In addition to its role as an incentivizing force, $Pina is also a stable dollar pegged to the value of $1. Using mechanisms inspired by Dynamic Set Dollar (DSD), we have optimized $Pina to better serve the needs of our marketplace. Its value remains stable, but it is also able to adapt to market demand by expanding or contracting as needed to maintain its usefulness within the NFT space.","links":"https://www.dontdiememe.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/meme-dollar/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x02814f435dd04e254be7ae69f61fca19881a780d"}}}
