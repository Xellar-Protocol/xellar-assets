{"name":"Cross-Chain Bridge","id":"cross-chain-bridge","symbol":"bridge","description":"Bridging fungible or non-fungible tokens is quite a laborious process. There are a variety of bridges that focus on connecting selected networks or support only selected tokens. As a user, you need to know which token you want to move over which bridge to another network. The Cross-Chain Bridge v2.0 has an ambitious goal: It should be possible to move as many tokens as possible to almost any network. The Cross-Chain Bridge will attract and incentivize all players to participate in the ecosystem. Similar to projects launching tokens on Uniswap or a DEX, communities and/or creators will be able to add their own token via the Cross-Chain Bridge intuitively and permissionlessly, benefiting from greater accessibility and security. Meanwhile, yield farmers AND projects will be incentivized to provide liquidity with fee-participation and yield farming.","links":"https://crosschainbridge.org/","market_cap":38055,"market_cap_rank":8943,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cross-chain-bridge/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x92868a5255c628da08f550a858a802f5351c5223","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x92868a5255c628da08f550a858a802f5351c5223"},"avalanche":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc0367f9b1f84ca8de127226ac2a994ea4bf1e41b","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/avax/tokens/0xc0367f9b1f84ca8de127226ac2a994ea4bf1e41b"},"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x92868a5255c628da08f550a858a802f5351c5223","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/polygon_pos/tokens/0x92868a5255c628da08f550a858a802f5351c5223"},"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x92868a5255c628da08f550a858a802f5351c5223","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x92868a5255c628da08f550a858a802f5351c5223"},"fantom":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x92868a5255c628da08f550a858a802f5351c5223","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/ftm/tokens/0x92868a5255c628da08f550a858a802f5351c5223"}}}
