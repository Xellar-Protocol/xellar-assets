{"name":"OOPS","id":"oops_solana","symbol":"oops","description":"Oops is the first Solana token distributed entirely through the x402 payment protocol. The project demonstrates a new token distribution model where each participant mints tokens directly by completing an on-chain payment via x402. Half of the collected funds were allocated to the liquidity pool, while the remaining 50% was distributed to payment contributors. Users who paid 5 USDC received a fixed allocation of 50,000 OOPS tokens. This mechanism showcases a transparent and decentralized launch model that links real payments to token minting without the need for presales or intermediaries, marking a milestone for x402-based token distribution on Solana.","links":"https://oopsmoneys.com/","market_cap":40765,"market_cap_rank":8528,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/oops/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"2VRC6F23CjLv3nBHnNw41ua21jACWKcFmbWH4KohNKWU","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/2VRC6F23CjLv3nBHnNw41ua21jACWKcFmbWH4KohNKWU"}},"is_native":false}
