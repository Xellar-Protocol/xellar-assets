{"name":"CakePoW","id":"cakepow","symbol":"cakepow","description":"CakePow is a decentralized yield farming running on Ethereum Pow and UniWswap swap exchange, with lots of other features that let you earn tokens. What we are trying to do is create a perpetual deflation token, the CAKESW, that allows a constant price pump with a sufficient burn mechanism. We are not trying to replace the swap but to add value into the system and create a suitable and sustainable environment for people to yield farm with high APR. We hope to create a CAKESW for everyone to farm from it! Earn CAKESW, and other coins (to be determined) while staking. Layered farming is a perpetual farming tool to allow CakesW to constantly enjoy a high-risk high-reward APY yield farming. Imagine a new xxxxswap site but hosted on CakePow where you can ape your money into it with no rugpull, no dumping, no hidden pool!","links":"https://cakepow.farm/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cakepow/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereumpow":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb61b46422ed95deeb5145adc9b405047ecd9a822"}}}
