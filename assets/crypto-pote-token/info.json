{"name":"Crypto Pote","id":"crypto-pote-token","symbol":"pope","description":"The crypto pote token is a BEP20 token that runs on the Binance Smart Chain network. Initially, there were 10,000,000 POPEs in circulation. A 2% fee is charged on each transaction and redistributed as follows : - Half of these fees are burned, reducing the number of POPEs in circulation to create an everincreasing scarcity phenomenon. - The other half of these fees are redistributed to the holders in proportion to their holdings in relation. From the date of listing, the POPE will be available for pre-sale at 1 USDT per POPE for up to 2 months. After these 2 months, the unsold POPEs will be burned as well as those of the creator's wallet who will only hold a maximum of 10% of the supply. 40% of the pre-sale money will be used as guarantee in case of dump. A buy limit order will be adjusted every week according to the number of POPE in the supply. Thus, investors are guaranteed to have a total sale of their pope at a minimum price that is constantly increasing thanks to the burn of the POPE on each transaction.","links":"https://cryptopotetoken.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/crypto-pote-token/logo.png"}
