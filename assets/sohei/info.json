{"name":"Sohei","id":"sohei","symbol":"hei","description":"Sohei is a decentralized lending protocol built on Arbitrum that aims to revolutionize DeFi by offering a lending market that is capital-efficient and supports a variety of assets. It features an innovative liquidation system that leverages off-chain liquidity and Dutch auctions, prioritizing partial liquidation of collateral and allowing borrowing and lending for exotic collateral assets with higher loan-to-value ratios, better collateral factors, and higher debt ceilings than competitors. $HEI is the multi-utility token of the Sohei Protocol. The utility is twofold: HEI stakers earn a part of the revenue generated by the protocol, and both holders and stakers are entitled to vote on important governance decisions. $HEI token holders own and control the Sohei protocol. Protocol incentives and rewards will also be paid out in $HEI. As the protocol evolves, holders of $HEI will enjoy additional advantages, such as improved LTVs, reduced borrowing costs, and better deposit rates. $HEI can also be staked to earn an APY and protect lenders against loss. Holders who have staked tokens can additionally receive fees from liquidations and earn higher APYs for having to hold their tokens for longer durations. 1- $HEI stakers earn a part of the revenue generated by the protocol. 2- Vote on important governance decisions. 3- Holders of $HEI will enjoy additional advantages, such as improved LTVs, reduced borrowing costs, and better deposit rates. 4- $HEI can also be staked to earn an APY and protect lenders against loss.
