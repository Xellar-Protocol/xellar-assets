{"name":"Utility Ape","id":"utility-ape","symbol":"$banana","description":"Utility APE is a web3 project that aims to provide a suite of tools for building and managing social communities on the blockchain. The team behind the project consists of web3 industry veterans with a combined experience of over 10 years and multiple successful project launches. The project aims to take the lessons learned from previous projects to create a new set of tools that will help other web3 projects. The project will be community-driven, taking input and suggestions from members to improve and adapt as web3 evolves. The first tool offered by the project is the Utility APE Engagement Bot, which encourages and rewards community engagement by tracking and providing points/tokens for social activity. The team has already seen success with this bot in their own discord server, which has industry-leading engagement statistics. The project will also offer a utility system where users can exchange points and tokens earned for prizes such as NFTs, tokens, bot access and features, and Steam games. The prize offerings will continue to expand as the project and partnerships grow. Our token $BANANA is used for our engage-to-earn clients as well as our main token utility for all further development tools on web3","links":"https://main.utilityape.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/utility-ape/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
