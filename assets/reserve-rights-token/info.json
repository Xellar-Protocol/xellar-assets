{"name":"Reserve Rights","id":"reserve-rights-token","symbol":"rsr","description":"Reserve aims to build a stable, decentralized, asset-backed cryptocurrency and a digital payment system that scales supply with demand and maintains 100% or more collateral backing. Ultimately, Reserve’s goal is to create a universal store of value – particularly in regions with unreliable banking infrastructure and regions where hyperinflation is an issue. The Reserve system will interact with three kinds of tokens: (1) The Reserve token (RSV), which is a stable cryptocurrency that can be held and spent the way we use normal fiat money; (2) The Reserve Rights token (RSR), a protocol token used to facilitate the stability of RSV. (3) A growing variety of tokenized real-world assets (such as other stablecoins) that are held by the Reserve smart contract to back RSV.","links":"https://reserve.org/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/reserve-rights-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x320623b8e4ff03373931769a31fc52a4e78b5d70"},"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xab36452dbac151be02b16ca17d8919826072f64a"},"energi":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xfce13bb63b60f6e20ed846ae73ed242d29129800"}}}
