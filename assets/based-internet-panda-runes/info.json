{"name":"BASED•INTERNET•PANDA (Runes)","id":"based-internet-panda-runes","symbol":"bip","description":"Based Internet Panda is a Rune etched on the Bitcoin blockchain. Based Internet Panda, or “BIP”, is a play on Bitcoin Improvement Proposals, which are design documents used to introduce features and improvements to the Bitcoin protocol. BIP can also be viewed as simply a cute and memeable panda on the internet. We strive to be based. Pandas are a symbol of harmony and balance. The internet is where we, as people, connect with the rest of the world. BIP aims to blend meme culture, fun, community, and crypto in its own unique way. BIP is mostly cute, but sometimes a little crazy and mean. Based Internet Panda is not just a Rune, it’s a mindset and a way of life.","links":"https://www.basedinternetpanda.com","market_cap":2586923,"market_cap_rank":2981,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/based-internet-panda-runes/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ordinals":{"decimal_place":0,"contract_address":"848143:1826"}}}
