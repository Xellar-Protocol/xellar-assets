Solfire's goal is to offer sophisticated, sustainable, and composable yield products which users can mix and match to produce their desired exposure. To this end, our core product suite is comprised of automated vault strategies and structured products and we look to expand into more exotic product lines in the near future. Fire Vault are vaults that run an automated options selling strategy, which earns yield on a weekly basis through writing out of the money options and collecting the premiums.","links":"https://www.solfire.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/solfire-finance/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"AfXLBfMZd32pN6QauazHCd7diEWoBgw1GNUALDw3suVZ"}}}
