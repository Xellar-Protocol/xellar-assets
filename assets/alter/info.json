The utility of the ALTER token extends beyond mere access to products. It plays a crucial role in the ecosystem, facilitating subscriptions, fee payments, and unlocking enhanced encrypted file storage capabilities. At the heart of ALTER's commitment to privacy is the assurance that users retain absolute control over their encryption private keys, which remain securely housed on their devices. User-generated data are effortlessly navigable on the platform, providing an intuitive interface for engaging with smart contracts and blockchain networks.
