{"name":"Bobby The Cat","id":"bobby-the-cat_solana","symbol":"btc","description":"Bobby isn’t just any feline—he’s the living, purring parody of something way too serious. While others argue about charts and coins, Bobby naps on keyboards and accidentally buys snacks with someone’s credit card. That’s right. $BTC isn’t what you think—it stands for Bobby The Cat. He’s fluffy, he’s moody, and he might’ve just knocked over your portfolio. Bobby doesn’t care. He’s got nine lives and zero stress. Because Bobby is the vibe. While Bitcoin pretends to be digital gold, Bobby The Cat is busy hiding your goldfish. He doesn’t ask for attention—he demands it with a side-eye and a tail flick. Bobby doesn’t need a roadmap. He’s got instincts. And when Bobby moves, people notice. Sometimes they follow. Sometimes they just watch in awe as he claims the top of the fridge like it’s a throne.","links":"https://bobbythecat.xyz/","market_cap":7267.1,"market_cap_rank":11779,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bobby-the-cat/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"2XYgocKz9MvkNVVyj85kdM2VxsUwrJeQUZVD4qmD4dYT","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/2XYgocKz9MvkNVVyj85kdM2VxsUwrJeQUZVD4qmD4dYT"}},"is_native":false}
