{"name":"DCOMY","id":"dcomy","symbol":"dco","description":"DCO is used as a utility token in DCOMY, serving as a means of payment for all on-chain activities. When a DApp incurs on-chain activities on multiple blockchains, it can pay for all transaction and gas fees using DCO alone. The platform will implicitly convert part of the collected DCO to the corresponding native currencies of the underlying blockchains, which are then consumed by the miners and validators on those blockchains.","links":"https://dcomy.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dcomy/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"0x2a304fda5a85182dca1d03741bb2f07881b9e095"}}}
