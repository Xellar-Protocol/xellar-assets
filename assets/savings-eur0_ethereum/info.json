{"name":"Savings EUR0","id":"savings-eur0_ethereum","symbol":"seur0","description":"The Usual protocol is a decentralized finance framework centered around yield bearing assets such as RWA or blue chip protocol tokens. It embodies the principle of redistributing value generated by users through a revenue-based token, USUAL. This approach enables users to access yields while simultaneously gaining exposure to the protocol’s growth and long-term success. Its innovative distribution model sets the stage for new DeFi possibilities, accelerating ecosystem expansion and sustainable decentralization.","links":"https://usual.money/","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/savings-eur0_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x35f43c6604b0de814abaa2d94c878bd1f5165478","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x35f43c6604b0de814abaa2d94c878bd1f5165478"}},"is_native":false}
