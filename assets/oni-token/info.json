{"name":"ONINO","id":"oni-token","symbol":"oni","description":"\"The ONI Token is the native utility token of the ONINO platform. While still being in development the ONINO platform will consist of 2 core products: the ONINO wallet and the ONINO blockchain. The ONINO wallet is a dashboard for users to link all their existing wallets and assets into one place. Thus enabling various use cases like tax calculation for all crypto assets or easy to use Identity verification on connceted dApps. Together with the ONINO chain the wallet will pave the way for a new kind of dApp-Generation. The ONINO blockchain is based on a dual-chain architecture to fully store sensitive data in a fully decentralized way. The public transaction chain shows all transactions and is in dialog with the secured non-scrapable data chain which transfers user data. The user can actievly decide when and which data is sent (through the ONINO wallet) and to whom. Enabling easy Identity verification will bring blockchain technologies to the next level and make mainstream adoption much easier.\"","links":"https://www.onino.io/","market_cap":3300783,"market_cap_rank":1843,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/oni-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xea89199344a492853502a7a699cc4230854451b8"},"fantom":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x667c856f1a624baefe89fc4909c8701296c86c98"}}}
