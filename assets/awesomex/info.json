{"name":"AwesomeX","id":"awesomex","symbol":"awx","description":"What is AwesomeX? Protocol Overview AwesomeX is simple: Use $TITANX to mint $AWX. There are perpetual weekly, twenty-four-hour mint cycles and 70% buy and burn. Additionally 15.5% of the TitanX used to mint AWX is taken off the market forever through DragonX. This means 85.5% of TitanX (70% + 15.5%) used to mint AWX is removed from the market permanently. (12% to the DragonX Vault + 3.5% Direct DragonX Burn = 15.5%) Minting today is better than minting tomorrow AwesomeX starts minting every Friday at 14:00 UTC until Saturday at 14:00 UTC. After each 24-hour mint, claim your tokens. This minting will continue weekly with a 2.8% decreasing percentage drop each week The decreased percentage in minting will last for 125 weeks and then stabilize.
