{"name":"PW-GOLD","id":"pw-gold","symbol":"pwg","description":"Planet Wars is a play-to-earn space battle game, based on the Binance Smart Chain and including concepts of NFT, DeFi and gamification. The Planet wars galaxy is made up of 1123 NFT planets. Each of them has unique characteristics that affect game bonuses. The resources present in the Planet Wars universe are three (Gold, Iron and Hydrogen). Each resource has different tokenomics and functionality. Once the universe has been generated and the resources released, players can challenge each other in epic individual and clan space battles, plundering other planets and fortifying their own. Planets, spacecraft and defensive structures are NFT tokens, which are mintable through a drop system on our DApp.","links":"https://planetwars.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pw-gold/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x1e70f310c902edff4f6176142831b02dc68564d5"}}}
