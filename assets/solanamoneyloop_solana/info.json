{"name":"SolanaMoneyLoop","id":"solanamoneyloop_solana","symbol":"loop","description":"LOOP ($LOOP) is the native token of Solana Money Loop, a revolutionary DeFi protocol on the Solana blockchain designed to transform every transaction into a wealth-building opportunity. Engineered for speed, scalability, and user empowerment, LOOP powers a high-yield ecosystem where holders earn passive income through a unique tax-and-redistribute model, enhanced by staking and lending capabilities. 🚨 A 5% tax is applied to every LOOP transaction, with 100% of these taxes redistributed directly to LOOP holders as SOL payouts, creating a continuous reward cycle. Built on Solana’s high-throughput, low-cost, and eco-friendly proof-of-history blockchain, LOOP ensures near-instant transactions, minimal fees, and audited smart contracts for robust security.","links":"https://www.solanamoneyloop.xyz/","market_cap":5671.55,"market_cap_rank":12182,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/solanamoneyloop_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"BVJJWHJuRLQtv7J3Qn5hMxtFYjywZEgvqorS9ZWngem","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/BVJJWHJuRLQtv7J3Qn5hMxtFYjywZEgvqorS9ZWngem"}},"is_native":false}
