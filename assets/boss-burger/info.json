The project was CTO'd by an all-star team who are having a ton of fun building community & making fan content of this hilarious quadrouple stack burger baddie on the blockchain. Here at #bossburger we’re building something rare. Not just a token. A crew. A digital backyard where everyone’s invited. We are building one order at a time.","links":"https://bossburger.fun/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/boss-burger/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x40d09d1c989fcb3a68623fe1c1acb3b769e0d237","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x40d09d1c989fcb3a68623fe1c1acb3b769e0d237"}}}
