{"name":"Abelian","id":"abelian","symbol":"abel","description":"What is the project about? Abelian is a Layer 1 Blockchain system which is quantum resistant and privacy preserving. By quantum resistant, Abelian’s cryptographic systems can defend against attacks launched by the future powerful quantum computers. By privacy preserving, Abelian has the privacy coin ABEL, which can be used with full privacy, privacy with accountability, or privacy in the pseudonymous level. What makes your project unique? This is the world’s first Blockchain system which is both post-quantum and privacy-preserving. In addition, the security and privacy assurance of Abelian are both mathematically proven secure. This is also the world’s first provably secure Blockchain system with its security and privacy being both mathematically reduced to some well-known quantum-resistant hard problems. Abelian’s lattice-based post-quantum cryptosystems are based on CRYSTALS-Dilithium and Kyber, both have been chosen by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as in the first batch of post-quantum cryptographic (PQcrypto) national standards. This symbolizes the mass adoption of these PQcrypto primitives by the federal agencies and the rest of the world for replacing existing elliptic curve cryptosystems. History of your project.
