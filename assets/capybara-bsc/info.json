{"name":"Capybara BSC","id":"capybara-bsc","symbol":"capy","description":"We are the next top meme coin and - to be honest - that is our only goal. Let's just say that Whitelists can be annoying. Especially if you don't know who is going to contribute and how much they will contribute. It's a pain-staking process for Project owners and Calls channels. Capy List is here to solve your needs. Thankfully, with the help of a super-talented dev, we are building an interface that will solve all of these issues and manage the campaigns so much more effectively. It's a FIRST!. Having said that, our utility will not fully be revealed until it has finished development. Since it is a novel concept, we want to avoid capybara questions like wen, wen and wen. We also dont want any other capybaras stealing our concept.","links":"https://capybara-coin.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/capybara-bsc/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0aec1e4ce3cd3ccee64ff1a2ee47770fd2b0d8d3"}}}
