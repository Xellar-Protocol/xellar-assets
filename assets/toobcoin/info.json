{"name":"Toobcoin","id":"toobcoin","symbol":"toob","description":"As Toobemi Technology, we started to shape and detail our project in the last quarter of 2019. As a joint stock company, we have a centralized structure in our country, with an average of 1 year of hard work, such as project detailing, team formation, and overcoming bureaucratic procedures. In the last quarter of 2020, we developed our insurance business by writing our full-time project into apps to make people understand. As of today, we have reached active users in more than 150 countries. Toobchain is the general name of the network that Toobemi will create with its sidechain technology. We call the currency that will be used over this network as Toobcoin, or TOOB for short. Users can securely store or transfer crypto funds on Toobwallet. It can also be used as a cold wallet. Our most important uniqueness that distinguishes us from other projects is our platform, which we call Toobins, where we will carry out insurance activities. This platform will work with our features that I just mentioned and will reshape the crypto money industry and make it safer. TOOBEMI takes its place in the market as the \"pioneer of crypto insurance\" in order to contribute to the formation of a safer crypto world for crypto investors by opening an umbrella against the negative factors affecting cryptocurrencies such as the increasing fraud in the crypto money sector, the risks of losing money of investors due to market instabilities and cyber attacks.","links":"https://www.toobemi.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/toobcoin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"tron":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"TV9HPmBWAC927VgYWfDWPgfUmj6nQYjjeU"}}}
