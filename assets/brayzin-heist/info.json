{"name":"Brayzin Heist","id":"brayzin-heist","symbol":"brzh","description":"Our app will be monetised using a combination of serving ads during natural breaks in the game between levels and offering in- app purchases to players whereby 80% of all revenue generated will be added into the Brayzin liquidity pool and locked for 100 years. Once all liquidity pool tokens have been allocated by us into the Brayzin liquidity pool, 80% of all in-app revenue generated will be used to re-purchase tokens to be burned and thereby pushing the price of the token upwards. This cycle will continually happen each month and makes us one of the few projects whose token is continually backed by a growing cash reserve and thereby ensuring we continuously have a mechanism in our control to push the token price higher and higher. The simple and addictive nature of our match 3 puzzle game will mean we are able to penetrate an audience in the hundreds of millions of players causing massive demand for our token and in turn massive revenue which then fuels our liquidity and token repurchase program. Another major unique feature of our project is that once the initial ICO sale has been completed, we will never require further funding as 20% of all revenue received will go towards operating expenses including continuous marketing and the future development of the project while of all revenue received 80% is used exclusively for increasing the tokens value. The bulk of the tokens that will ever be available (69%) can only be unlocked by playing our Brayzin Heist game and the quicker tokens are unlocked (earned) the quicker the token price will increase due to increased revenue available for liquidity pools and re-purchase for burning.","links":"https://brayzin.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/brayzin-heist/logo.png"}
