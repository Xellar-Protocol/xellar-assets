{"name":"BaseX","id":"basex","symbol":"bsx","description":"BaseX - an innovative approach to Concentrated Liquidity AMM, built by BaseSwap to provide higher efficiency and a more flexible liquidity and farming experience. BaseX is the first on Base to implement Merkle by the Angle Protocol, which enhances your rewards system. The position you choose determines your rewards: the narrower your position, the higher your rewards and vice versa. Moreover, protocols can add more than one reward to the liquidity pool, allowing users to earn multiple rewards simultaneously. This means your incentives from partners and farming can be received at the same time, and everything is permissionless. BaseX offers the ability to provide liquidity in custom ranges, or pre-defined ones. To simplify the process for users who prefer not to provide liquidity in custom ranges and monitor/rebalance regularly, we're partnering with DefiEdge, our first ALMM on the Base chain. Their Automated Liquidity Manager for our pools effortlessly rebalances your position, making the experience hassle-free for all users. You earn rewards regardless of whether you choose custom ranges or ALMM","links":"https://baseswap.fi/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/basex/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd5046b976188eb40f6de40fb527f89c05b323385"}}}
