{"name":"Honey","id":"honey","symbol":"hny","description":"1Hive is a DAO that issues and distributes a digital currency called Honey. Honey holders stake on proposals using Conviction Voting to determine how issuance is distributed. By supporting proposals which increase the value of Honey, a positive feedback loop drives growth and sustainability. Conviction Voting allows everyone to participate and shape the direction of 1Hive, while preventing anyone from taking control or ownership.","links":"https://1hive.org/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/honey/logo.png"}
