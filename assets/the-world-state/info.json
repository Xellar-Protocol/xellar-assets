The World State (TWS) is the First Decentralized Crypto State driven by smart contracts and based on Direct Democracy.

TWS uses NFTs to get citizenship, create laws, vote for community initiatives, found parties and run for president's office. It also has ambitious development plans, including TWS Blockchain Net, TWSwallet, TWSbridge, and TWSassets platform. The Constitution is the prime legal law in TWS, which defines all the fundamental principles and rules for TWS. TWS Citizens interact directly with the ecosystem and the blockchain protocol, which guarantees their rights granted by the TWS Constitution. All of these features are powered by the W$C token.","links":"https://theworldstate.io/","market_cap":81533,"market_cap_rank":6298,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/the-world-state/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x77a6f2e9a9e44fd5d5c3f9be9e52831fc1c3c0a0"}}}
