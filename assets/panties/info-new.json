{"name":"PANTIES","id":"panties","symbol":"panties","description":"Introducing PANTIES: a conceptual art project and memecoin spearheaded by a collective of approximately 69 veteran Pepe and meme artists. In the tumultuous landscape of social media, we've observed a profound transformation in recent times. Once a sanctuary for indulging in the finest memes known to modern humanity, platforms now buzz with discussions of memecoin trading, financial sagas of victory and defeat. While we embrace the chaotic evolution of the digital economy, we can't help but mourn the loss of our beloved meme culture. In response to this paradigm shift, we've embarked on a bold endeavor: the deployment of PANTIES. This innovative project allows us to not only engage with the memecoin economy but also reconnect with our creative roots by inundating our timelines with original, captivating memes. PANTIES represents more than just a memecoin: it's a testament to our resilience as artists navigating the ever-changing landscape of online culture. Join us as we embark on this exhilarating journey, embracing the chaos and weaving our artistry into the fabric of the digital age.","links":"https://panties.wtf/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/panties/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"35Y3VgNdaJ6AxBqifh8wCemR7x8PLd4xibB2C3JUZ9P7"}}}
