{"name":"Tribal","id":"tribal-triballygames","symbol":"tribal","description":"Social-fi meets Game-fi The Tribally platform provides a single, unified portal for gamers to discover and enjoy a variety of games, communities and events across web3 gaming, using real-time game, social and blockchain data to incentivise and reward participation. Reputation scoring is at the heart of the Tribally experience, and is the basis for influence, content discovery and rewards eligibility on Tribally. Gamers can build up their profile and grow their reputation score whilst discovering new games, exploring new communities and collecting rewards. Creators and influential gamers can create and monetize their own gaming group, with data to measure how successfully they can grow and encourage their audience to be active in the games they support. The more successful groups are recognised for the value they provide to games and are rewarded fairly for their achievements. Tribally provides a competitive advantage for games and their growth teams. Games benefit from increased awareness from plugging their game into our cross-platform social layer, user growth from activating their game on our network of gamers, and next-generation acquisition and retention strategies through our analytics.","links":"https://tribally.games","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/tribal-triballygames/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
