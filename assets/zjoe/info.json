{"name":"zJOE","id":"zjoe","symbol":"zjoe","description":"Vector turns your PTP and JOE into productive assets by allowing you to convert them to xPTP and zJOE, which can then be staked to earn a share of Vector's performance fees. Vector utilizes the tokens converted on the platform to stake on Platypus / Trader Joe, accruing vePTP and veJOE into perpetuity since we will never sell. Our vePTP/veJOE balances are then used to boost stablecoin/LP yields on Vector, generating revenue for our protocol. xPTP and zJOE stakers receive ~66% of Vector's revenue, plus additional rewards via our governance token, VTX.","links":"https://vectorfinance.io/","market_cap":3399832,"market_cap_rank":2175,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/zjoe/logo.png","detail_platform":{"avalanche":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x769bfeb9faacd6eb2746979a8dd0b7e9920ac2a4"}}}
