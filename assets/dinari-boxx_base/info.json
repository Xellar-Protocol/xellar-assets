By leveraging blockchain technology, BOXX.d provides investors with exposure to short-term, low-risk returns, while benefiting from 24/7 trading, fractional ownership, instant settlement, and enhanced liquidity.","links":"https://www.dinari.com/","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dinari-boxx_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa70cc6f267e02a6e135fa2589432e6734a613eb3","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xa70cc6f267e02a6e135fa2589432e6734a613eb3"}},"is_native":false}
