{"name":"Charred Treasures","id":"charred-treasures_base","symbol":"charred","description":"Charred Treasures is a Real-World Asset (RWA) project that introduces the concept of tokenized active management. The project introduces a Curator model in which a domain expert oversees procurement and strategic decisions for the project vault, integrating elements from traditional finance asset management and on-chain mechanisms to support the long-term growth of the underlying reserve. The token reflects exposure to the performance of this curated portfolio. For this project, the mandate will be for the Curator to acquire Base Set 1st Edition Charizard Pokemon cards.","links":"https://charred.io/","market_cap":2155550,"market_cap_rank":2890,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/charred-treasures_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x11ff37785b849f38117a7ab2dff766c056d8ba6d","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x11ff37785b849f38117a7ab2dff766c056d8ba6d"}},"is_native":false}
