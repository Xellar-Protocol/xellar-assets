{"name":"Rewardeum","id":"rewardeum","symbol":"reum","description":"REWARDEUM is the first Binance Smart Chain rewards token developed to solve the issues of rapidly depleting rewards pools by utilizing revolutionary new mechanics never seen before. Rewardeumâ€™s main aim is to ensure that daily rewards remain consistent across fluctuating trading volume. To achieve this, (1) our Dynamic Tax Protocol will prioritise and maximise the replenishment of the reward pools whilst only diverting taxes to the liquidity pool when required, and (2) our Smart Pool mechanism would store all excessive trading volume as reserve for the days of lower trading volume. This allows for consistent reward pool growth whilst simultaneously protecting the token from low liquidity price impact.","links":"https://rewardeum.com","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/rewardeum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x5a68431398a6de785994441e206259702e259c5e"}}}
