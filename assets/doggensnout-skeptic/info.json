{"name":"Doggensnout Skeptic","id":"doggensnout-skeptic","symbol":"dogs","description":"The Pepe Predator — Drawings by Matt Furie Matt Furie is widely recognized as the creator of Pepe the Frog, an iconic character that has taken on a life of its own across various internet communities. Beyond Pepe, however, Furie’s creative universe extends to lesser-known characters that also embody his distinctive, playful, and sometimes absurd style. One such creation is the Doggensnout Skeptic, a character poised as Pepe the Frog’s predator. In the ever-evolving world of digital and meme culture, where Pepe tokens have garnered significant attention, the emergence of the Doggensnout Skeptic introduces an intriguing dynamic. Given its direct connection to Pepe the Frog and its unique position within Furie’s imaginative ecosystem, there’s potential for the Doggensnout Skeptic to capture the interest of collectors and investors. If Pepe tokens are “going to the moon” in the realm of digital collectibles, the Doggensnout Skeptic, being dubbed the “Pepe killer,” might also see significant interest and activity. This relationship underscores the unpredictable and often whimsical nature of internet culture, where even the most unexpected characters can rise to prominence.","links":"https://thepepepredator.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/doggensnout-skeptic/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x21e5c85a5b1f38bddde68307af77e38f747cd530"}}}
