{"name":"Mata","id":"mata","symbol":"mata","description":"MATA is an uncapped utility token generated by Game System, its supply grows as more players join the game. Players can spend MATA within the game to breed new Ninneko, purchase multiple items, and earn by playing the game, especially by winning PvP battles. Upon spending MATA, MATA is burned (permanently removed from the supply). This burning mechanism partially offsets inflation. Purchasing MATA on the open market is also a way for gamers to get a headstart. MATA is a token generated by Game System which players can earn playing the game, especially by winning PvP battles.","links":"https://ninneko.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mata/logo.png"}
