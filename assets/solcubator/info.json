{"name":"Solcubator","id":"solcubator","symbol":"solc","description":"Solcubator aims to drive the expansion and adoption of the Solana ecosystem by providing a secure and decentralized platform for projects seeking funding and incubation and for investors to filter the value-added projects as it's community-driven. Over time, the platform will evolve into a full-fledged DeFi-based solution protocol by introducing various products, such as a farm, a DEX, and lending & borrowing facilities. You can expect at least one product to be added to the ecosystem per quarter, and for every product, the SOLC token will play a central role.","links":"https://solcubator.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/solcubator/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"Bx1fDtvTN6NvE4kjdPHQXtmGSg582bZx9fGy4DQNMmAT"}}}
