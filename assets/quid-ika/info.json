A new community-owned token founded by experienced crypto enthusiasts, developers, and entrepreneurs. Inspired by the mighty squid who has risen up the chain with no competitors in sight. Our community has risen from a dying ecosystem into a flourishing Ikasystem. Quid Ika generates revenue with its insanely competitive Quidity.io App and the Ikasystem token launch pad— all of which is strategically used for buybacks and burns. APP: Liquidity + Quid = Quidity App Our app (quidity.io) is a one-stop for any crypto enthusiast. It features reflection tracking, portfolio tracking, whale wallet watching, live charts & dex trades, token news, and more. Quidity is one of our many sources of revenue.
