{"name":"WYDE: End Hunger","id":"wyde-end-hunger_base","symbol":"eat","description":"$EAT (WYDE: End Hunger) is a token on the Base network designed to generate continuous funding for hunger relief organizations through trading activity. The token operates on the WYDE Impact Exchange, a platform where a portion of trading fees automatically flows to verified 501(c)(3) nonprofits. When users trade $EAT, 25% of the dynamic trading fee is allocated to hunger relief causes. The token has a total supply of 100 billion, with 80% locked in vesting schedules tied to meals-funded milestones rather than time-based unlocks. The remaining 20% provides initial liquidity and operational support. $EAT targets the intersection of two markets: 52 million Americans who hold digital assets and 47 million Americans facing food insecurity. The hunger relief sector in the United States receives $4.27 billion in annual charitable giving and distributes 9.7 billion meals through established infrastructure including Feeding America's network of 200+ food banks and 60,000 food pantries.","links":"https://www.wyde.org/eat","market_cap":194749,"market_cap_rank":5951,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wyde-end-hunger_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x680bc6ed5c7222e2f29bdbc87f8e8f3400d8ce04","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x680bc6ed5c7222e2f29bdbc87f8e8f3400d8ce04"}},"is_native":false}
