{"name":"Qace Dynamics","id":"qace-dynamics_ethereum","symbol":"qace","description":"QACE Dynamics | QARC at the Core of Robotics Autonomy Robotics is advancing fast, yet most projects struggle with the same obstacles: fragmented AI stacks, long integration cycles, and dependence on the cloud. Engineers spend months trying to connect vision, speech, mapping, and decision systems, often ending up with fragile solutions that fail in real-world environments where privacy and reliability matter most. QACE Dynamics addresses this gap with QARC, our edge AI supercomputer designed specifically for robotics. QARC is a complete kit built to make autonomy truly plug and play. QARC comes preloaded with modular AI blocks that provide the core intelligence robots need: 1. Vision systems that detect objects, faces, and activities. 2. Voice understanding for natural command and control. 3. Mapping and localization for real-time navigation. 4. Decision orchestration that fuses perception and logic into dependable actions. These modules are engineered to work seamlessly together, removing the need for advanced AI expertise or complex integration. Robots can be equipped with QARC and instantly gain cognitive capabilities. The strength of QARC lies in its edge first design. By running intelligence directly on the robot, QARC ensures: 1. Instant reliability with no dependency on cloud signals. 2. Privacy by default, keeping sensitive data on site. 3. Field readiness, allowing robots to operate anywhere, from factories to hospitals to outdoor environments. At the same time, QARC is flexible. It can connect online when scale or remote coordination is needed, giving robots both local first autonomy and optional cloud extension. With QARC, the bottlenecks of fragmented AI stacks and complex integration are removed. Instead of being limited by delays and dependencies, robots can operate smarter and adapt faster in real-world scenarios. This combination of powerful hardware and modular AI is what sets QACE Dynamics apart. QARC is not just a concept, it is a deployable solution that makes advanced autonomy practical. With QARC, autonomy becomes easy, private, and ready to scale. QACE Dynamics is redefining how robots gain intelligence, turning complex AI into a plug and play foundation for the machines of tomorrow. QACE Dynamics is where robotics gains true edge autonomy.","links":"https://qacedynamics.com/","market_cap":4060188,"market_cap_rank":2264,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/qace-dynamics_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x696025fab2f3e2ade78e57a3f553e993d2996615","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x696025fab2f3e2ade78e57a3f553e993d2996615"}},"is_native":false}
