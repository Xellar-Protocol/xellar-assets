{"name":"BabyDogeZilla","id":"babydogezilla","symbol":"babydogezilla","description":"BabyDogeZilla is a low tax, deflationary meme-token with simple tokenomics designed to reward the holders of the token. Inspired by Dogecoin, Baby Doge Coin, and Doge Zilla, BabyDogeZilla seeks to incentivize new investors to buy in and existing investors to hold. This is achieved through daily manual burns (a.k.a. BURNZILLA) and building a strong community of investors. The purpose of BabyDogeZilla is to reward its holders through a continually rising price floor, which is not driven by rebasing mechanics, but instead through simple and effective tokenomics. In the next phase of the project, BabyDogeZilla will form the center-piece of the BabyDogeZilla ecosystem, which includes NFT collections, staking, a launchpad, and other Web3.0 products and services.","links":"https://babydogezilla.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/babydogezilla/logo.png"}
