{"name":"CorionPlatform","id":"corionplatform_solana","symbol":"corxs","description":"CORXS is a meme token championing DeFi’s core values: fair launch, equal access, and decentralization. It is an experimental token designed to promote the original spirit of DeFi — fair launch, equal opportunity for all, and a truly decentralized environment. It serves as a playful yet principled initiative within the Solana ecosystem, with no VC backing, no pre-mine, and a 100% community-driven approach. CORXS aims to engage users not only through humor but also by encouraging participation in a transparent, inclusive, and censorship-resistant financial system.","links":"https://corion.io/","market_cap":13145.83,"market_cap_rank":10615,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/corionplatform/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"HTpyUJv6vGdfGeViRhegUpPHn8hiXRhX7ZWi5xvCDhZZ","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/HTpyUJv6vGdfGeViRhegUpPHn8hiXRhX7ZWi5xvCDhZZ"}},"is_native":false}
