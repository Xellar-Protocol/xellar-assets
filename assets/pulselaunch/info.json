{"name":"PulseLaunch","id":"pulselaunch","symbol":"launch","description":"PulseLaunch is a pioneering, community-governed launchpad designed to democratize access to innovative blockchain projects. At its core, PulseLaunch facilitates a transparent and equitable platform where upcoming projects can gain traction, secure funding, and thrive. With an emphasis on decentralization, the platform ensures that every community member has a voice in guiding the direction and selection of projects, fostering a truly democratic ecosystem. The platform introduces PulsePoints, a unique reward system that empowers holders by allowing them to stake PulseLaunch tokens ($LAUNCH) to earn PulsePoints. These points grant exclusive access to project launches, emphasizing participation over mere token holding. PulsePoints cannot be bought or sold. Coupled with a DAO structure, PulseLaunch ensures that token holders benefit from the ecosystem's growth and actively contribute to it. This model aims to shift the paradigm of project launches, making them more accessible, transparent, and community-focused.","links":"https://www.pulselaunch.xyz/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pulselaunch/logo.png","detail_platform":{"pulsechain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe101c848620e762ecb942356962dd415342b4feb"}}}
