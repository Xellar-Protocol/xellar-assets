{"name":"Space and Time","id":"space-and-time","symbol":"sxt","description":"Space and Time is the Microsoft-backed blockchain for ZK-proven data. Powered by Proof of SQL, a sub-second ZK coprocessor, Space and Time allows smart contracts, AI agents, and onchain applications to query onchain and offchain data at scale and verify the results with cryptographic proofs. The foundation of Space and Time is a decentralized layer 1 blockchain where validators verify every piece of data that gets inserted into the network, updating and signing cryptographic commitments on the data before recording them onchain. Developers can query this data via Proof of SQL and receive back a trustless, tamperproof result onchain. Space and Time allows smart contracts to query over the full history of major blockchains and offchain sources in a verifiable way, enabling a new generation of sophisticated, data-driven onchain apps. The SXT token is deployed as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum and functions as the network's native utility token. SXT is used for staking, data processing payments, access control, and incentives for data contributors.","links":"https://www.spaceandtime.io","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/space-and-time/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe6bfd33f52d82ccb5b37e16d3dd81f9ffdabb195","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xe6bfd33f52d82ccb5b37e16d3dd81f9ffdabb195"}}}
