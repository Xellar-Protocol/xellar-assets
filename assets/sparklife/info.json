Also within our city you can own lands, casinos, and slot machines that will be in dynamic nft contracts that will make you exclusive owners of these assets and generate profits as if you had a business in a real city. To all this we bet on the digital tourism of this city and we have worked hand in hand with the local government for its development.","links":"https://sparklifesps.com/","market_cap":1838320,"market_cap_rank":3339,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/sparklife/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"0x8033064fe1df862271d4546c281afb581ee25c4a"}}}
