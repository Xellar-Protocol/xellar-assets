{"name":"Cartesi","id":"cartesi","symbol":"ctsi","description":"What is Cartesi? Ease of Adoption: Developers can work in a familiar environment with no artificial limitations and with access to all their favorite tools; Portability: Cartesi aims to make DApps portable across the most important public blockchains that support smart contracts; Privacy: DApp states can be kept private among application participants. CTSI Overview and Use Cases CTSI is a utility token that works as a crypto-fuel for Noether. Stakers receive CTSI rewards by staking their tokens and participating in the network. Node runners are selected randomly according to a PoS system and gain the right to create the next block. Users of the network pay CTSI fees to insert data on the side-chain. CTSI will also be used for DApps to outsource the execution of verifiable and enforceable computation to entities running Descartes nodes.","links":"https://cartesi.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cartesi/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x491604c0fdf08347dd1fa4ee062a822a5dd06b5d"},"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x2727ab1c2d22170abc9b595177b2d5c6e1ab7b7b"},"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8da443f84fea710266c8eb6bc34b71702d033ef2"},"optimistic-ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xec6adef5e1006bb305bb1975333e8fc4071295bf"},"avalanche":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6b289cceaa8639e3831095d75a3e43520fabf552"},"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x319f865b287fcc10b30d8ce6144e8b6d1b476999"}}}
