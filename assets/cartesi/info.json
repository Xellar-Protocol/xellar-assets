Ease of Adoption: Developers can work in a familiar environment with no artificial limitations and with access to all their favorite tools; Portability: Cartesi aims to make DApps portable across the most important public blockchains that support smart contracts; Privacy: DApp states can be kept private among application participants. CTSI Overview and Use Cases CTSI is a utility token that works as a crypto-fuel for Noether. Stakers receive CTSI rewards by staking their tokens and participating in the network. Node runners are selected randomly according to a PoS system and gain the right to create the next block. Users of the network pay CTSI fees to insert data on the side-chain. CTSI will also be used for DApps to outsource the execution of verifiable and enforceable computation to entities running Descartes nodes.","links":"https://cartesi.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cartesi/logo.png"}
