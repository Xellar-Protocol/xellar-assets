{"name":"The Fedz FUSD","id":"fusd-by-the-fedz","symbol":"fusd","description":"The Fedz is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol focused on providing a more efficient, resilient stablecoin solution. Its core product, FUSD, is an under-collateralized stablecoin issued on Arbitrum. The protocol implements a fractional reserve model combined with sequential access and private liquidity pools, inspired by academic research in financial stability and game theory. FUSD is designed to reduce the risk of bank runs and liquidation events, enabling users to mint, trade, and use stable value on-chain without relying on full collateral backing. The Fedz aims to make DeFi safer and more capital efficient, while giving users transparent tools to manage liquidity and stability directly from their wallets.","links":"https://TheFedz.org","market_cap":10008.87,"market_cap_rank":10875,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/fusd-by-the-fedz/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x894341be568eae3697408c420f1d0acfce6e55f9","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/arbitrum/tokens/0x894341be568eae3697408c420f1d0acfce6e55f9"}}}
