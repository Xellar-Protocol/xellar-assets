{"name":"SOLA-X","id":"sola-x","symbol":"sax","description":"SOLA-X | Smart liquidity cross-chain protocol built on Solana. SOLA-X is changing the way AMMs are designed within the Solana ecosystem. SOLA-X has developed flexible and dynamic liquidity pools that enable multiple assets within a pool or features such as unilateral liquidity provisioning, intra-platform liquidity aggregation, and intelligent liquidity management. Furthermore, SOLA-X connects Solana to the most popular EVM ecosystems such as Ethereum, Binance Chain, and Polygon. Which pain point does SOLA-X solve? Providing liquidity to multiple liquidity pools and monitoring them as well as rebalancing liquidity allocations in a way to maximize the APY and reduce downside risks like impermanent loss is a difficult task. SOLA-X solves these pain points liquidity providers are facing using traditional AMMs like Uniswap. Due to SOLA-Xâ€™s AMM architecture and protocol-managed liquidity, a liquidity provider does not have to monitor and rebalance single liquidity pool allocations. Within SOLA-X, a feature called smart liquidity manages the liquidity in a way that single pool risks are minimized and the realized APY is the highest possible. A user only has to deposit one single asset in order to provide liquidity to multiple pools.
