{"name":"Gabriel","id":"gabriel_solana","symbol":"gabriel","description":"GABRIEL is a research-driven AI alignment project built on first principles. We developed a model-agnostic framework that stabilizes reasoning, eliminates context loss, and provides persistent memory without GPUs or fine-tuning. The goal is to create an AI that grows with the user over time, improving safety, clarity, and reliability. The project focuses on transparent benchmarking, reproducible results, and real-world safety outcomes rather than hype.","links":"https://foundation-labs.io/","market_cap":216457,"market_cap_rank":5805,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gabriel_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"2EH5Y18tw366g3VQvXKXKhr4zhYD6sC8X2Ktw3ocpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/2EH5Y18tw366g3VQvXKXKhr4zhYD6sC8X2Ktw3ocpump"}},"is_native":false}
