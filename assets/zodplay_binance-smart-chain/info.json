{"name":"Zodplay","id":"zodplay_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"zod","description":"ZOD Play is a decentralized ecosystem built on the BNB Chain that combines tiered staking, token mining, and a value distribution mechanism based on active participation. The project generates utility for its native token, ZOD, through an integrated economic model that includes: An on-chain floor supported by a USDT-backed liquidity pool; Progressive staking with multiple tiers, where users accumulate ZOD rewards from transaction fees, token burns, and mining allocations; A fair mining system tied to participation in engagement rounds, with proportional distribution based on eligibility criteria; Scheduled trading fee halving mechanisms and anti-manipulation protections at launch. The ecosystem is designed to incentivize long-term retention, align incentives among participants, and sustain internal liquidity through autonomous economic flows and auditable smart contracts.","links":"https://zodplay.space","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/zodplay_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xed0e0d988da8c70250671c3b03dcf7249142a045","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xed0e0d988da8c70250671c3b03dcf7249142a045"}},"is_native":false}
