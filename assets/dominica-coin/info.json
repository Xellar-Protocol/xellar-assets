{"name":"Dominica Coin","id":"dominica-coin","symbol":"dmc","description":"About DMC and Dominica DID ● The issuance of Dominica Coin (DMC) is endorsed by the Dominica government. DMC is the world’s first national token, as well as a symbol displaying the embracement of countries to virtual assets and metaverse. DMC is issued on the TRC 20 standard and will be expanded to the ERC 20 and BEP 20 standards. It will support the cross-chain interaction with Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain through the BitTorrent Chain protocol. ● DMC will be issued for sale through Huobi Prime. Meanwhile, Huobi will airdrop DMC tokens and enable the Dominica DID application to each registered user. ● Users can complete identity verification on Huobi with their Dominica DIDs. Users who have already completed identity verification will also acquire the Dominica DIDs. ● A Dominica DID-verified account enjoys the same rights and interests as an account verified via any other nationality on the premise of compliance with laws and regulations. ● Users can transfer their Dominica DIDs to the Tron network to generate Soul-Bound Tokens (SBTs) which entitle the holders to all rights and interests endowed by SBT. Moreover, in the Dominica Metaverse, SBT holders are entitled to Metaverse Dominica digital citizenship that is completely mapped from the real world. ● Official physical certificates of DIDs are available after users have filled in the mailing address and paid the necessary handling cost.","links":"https://www.huobi.com/en-us/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dominica-coin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
