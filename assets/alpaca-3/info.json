{"name":"Alpaca","id":"alpaca-3","symbol":"alpaca","description":"The alpaca is a strange mascot, to say the least, but it’s one that Bitcoin (BTC) desperately needed early in its lifespan. Though Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s founder, never created a mascot design for his cryptocurrency, the community quickly embraced the alpaca as the symbol of their favorite token. For the first time in February 2011, people were granted the opportunity to use their Bitcoin to buy goods when a link was sent to a social news website known as Slashdot. The link directed users to the Grass Hill Alpacas farm. This seemingly random farm immediately caught the attention of aspiring Bitcoin enthusiasts, allowing them to buy alpaca goods and services with their Bitcoins.","links":"https://alpacabtcmascot.com/","market_cap":4692.44,"market_cap_rank":10191,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/alpaca-3/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"2AZH2nNLNzmG3v6nMC88pUEXWo3GA58zHzPxAmUppump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/2AZH2nNLNzmG3v6nMC88pUEXWo3GA58zHzPxAmUppump"}}}
