Based on Balancer V2, users can create liquidity pools consisting of up to eight assets, yield farm, and swap stablecoins & tokens on Starfish decentralized exchange (DEX). In addition to a full DeFi suite, Starfish also enables $DOT liquid staking to unlock liquidity potentials while users continue to earn $DOT staking rewards. As a one-stop shop, Starfish also offers peer-to-pool NFT financing that supports cross-chain collateralization. Through its integration with Celer Networkâ€™s IM Framework, an inter-chain messaging mechanism, users can stake NFTs on its native chain as collateral to borrow assets from Starfish Reserve Vault. While lenders can provide liquidity in forms of stablecoins and other assets to the Reserve Vault to earn interest. SEAN holders gain access to liquidated NFT auctions for a chance to purchase NFTs at a discount.","links":"https://starfish.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/starfish-finance/logo.png"}
