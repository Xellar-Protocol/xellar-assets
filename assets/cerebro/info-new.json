Cerebro Bot provides one access point to trade tokens across all supported chains, eliminating the need for traders to interact with multiple wallets, exchanges, or bridges. Simple commands allow users to perform complex cross-chain swaps without leaving the bot interface. Utilizing a proprietary routing protocol, Cerebro Bot optimizes the transaction flow by: - Automatically detecting the tokenâ€™s native chain. - Finding the best route for the swap across chains. - Executing the trade without the user needing to manage multiple steps.
