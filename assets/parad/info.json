{"name":"PARAD","id":"parad","symbol":"prd","description":"An innovative Web3 platform for secure, efficient, and transparent digital check transactions. This project offers a Web3 solution aimed at digitizing check and promissory note transactions, making financial processes more secure, faster, and transparent. Supported by NFT (Non-Fungible Token) technology, the system allows users to manage check and promissory note transactions in a digital environment. Blockchain ensures that all transactions are transparently recorded, while the decentralized structure minimizes the risks of fraud and forgery. Users can join the platform after completing the KYC (Know Your Customer) verification process and execute check transactions. Smart contracts automatically manage expiration dates, fund transfers, and payment processes, eliminating the need for manual intervention and speeding up transactions. Funds are securely stored in the platform's pool and are only released when the check reaches its expiration. The project addresses the weaknesses of traditional financial systems, providing a vision where digital checks and promissory notes will gain broader adoption and become more widespread for financial transactions. This innovative Web3-based model sets a new standard in the digital finance world, emphasizing security and transparency.","links":"https://prddao.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/parad/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc011c17e3cba7f16df7fde8c8cbe7c2511a07783"}}}
