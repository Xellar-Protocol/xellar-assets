{"name":"GetTheGirl","id":"getthegirl_solana","symbol":"gtg","description":"GTG (Get The Girl) is an interactive AI-powered relationship game built on the Solana blockchain. Players engage in emotionally driven scenarios with an in-game character named Celine, progressing through levels that simulate modern romance and decision-making. GTG integrates GameFi mechanics with token utility by rewarding top players through a monthly jackpot, while 50% of all in-game spending is used to buy and burn tokens, creating a deflationary ecosystem. The project aims to gamify crypto adoption through entertainment, with features such as staking, NFTs, multiplayer mini-games, and DAO governance planned in future updates. GTG is designed to be community-focused and self-sustaining, blending token utility with immersive gameplay and ongoing expansion of the GTG universe.","links":"https://getthegirl.io/","market_cap":13768.63,"market_cap_rank":10514,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/getthegirl/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"4nm1ksSbynirCJoZcisGTzQ7c3XBEdxQUpN9EPpemoon","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/4nm1ksSbynirCJoZcisGTzQ7c3XBEdxQUpN9EPpemoon"}},"is_native":false}
