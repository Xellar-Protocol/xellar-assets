{"name":"Morphware","id":"morphware","symbol":"xmw","description":"Morphware is currently the most interesting project at the intersection of AI and Web3 because of its unique focus on constructing a superpeer. Superpeers are a core component of bootstrapping peer-to-peer networks, and in Morphwareâ€™s case: that means having access to an abundance of affordable electricity as 65-90% of the costs of both high-performance computing and cryptocurrency mining workloads are related directly to the price of electricity. The project was founded as a protocol by a team of professional data scientists, smart contract engineers, and full-stack developers in 2021.","links":"https://www.morphware.io/","market_cap":31763971,"market_cap_rank":868,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/morphware/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x391cf4b21f557c935c7f670218ef42c21bd8d686"}}}
