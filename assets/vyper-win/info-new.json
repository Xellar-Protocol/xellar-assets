{"name":"VYPER.WIN","id":"vyper-win","symbol":"vyper","description":"Vyper is the first of the \"Volt Pillars.\" It's built on Volt Technology meaning the same revolutionary perpetual auction system and hyper deflation, except the input Token is DragonX and new first of a kind in DEFI buy and burn is introduced called \"The Nexus\" 73% of DragonX value is allocated to the NEXUS, with three simultaneous buy-and-burns for DRAGONX, VOLT, and VYPER. DragonX Buy and Burn: The DragonX buy and grow has two parts: “The Input” and “The Nexus.” 70% of DragonX value goes to “The Input,” following the same daily percentage as VOLT (42% on Day 2, decreasing to 15% by Day 11, then stays at 15% indefinitely). \"DragonX Input\" buy-and-grow uses funds to buy VOLT: 8% VOLT goes to the Treasure Volt The rest is used the next day to buy VYPER. VOLT Buy and Burn: The VOLT buy-and-grow purchases VYPER: 3% of VYPER goes to Genesis. 8% to the liquidity wallet. 10% is burned. 20% goes to \"Vyper's Treasure\" (similar to Treasure Volt). The rest is used the next day to buy DRAGONX. VYPER Buy and Burn: The VYPER buy-and-grow purchases DRAGONX: 8% of DragonX goes to the liquidity wallet. The rest is used the next day to buy VOLT. DragonX Nexus Buy and Burn: The Nexus buy-and-grow for DRAGONX: 0% is taken out as the 8% Volt equivalent already taken out from initial input buy and build. All is used the next day to buy VOLT.","links":"https://Vyper.win","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/vyper-win/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd7fa4cfc22ea07dfced53033fbe59d8b62b8ee9e"}}}
