After years of development, TokenPocket has formed three major business segments: wallet products, on-chain products and stablecoins payment. Among them, wallet products have become the world's largest decentralized stablecoin wallet, with services covering more than 200 countries and regions around the world, with a total of more than 30 million users and 5 million monthly active users. TPT, or TokenPocket Token, is the utility token of the TokenPocket ecosystem (referred to as the TP ecosystem). TPT can be used in various scenarios as a payment method and proof of membership benefits, serving as a connective thread throughout the TP ecosystem, with its rights and applications continuously expanding. TPT is a fully circulating token with a long-term deflationary model. Starting from July 1, 2025, the TokenPocket Foundation plans to implement a biannual buyback and burn program for TPT, aiming to reduce its total supply from 3.466 billion to 1 billion tokens.","links":"https://tp.xyz/","market_cap":34796810,"market_cap_rank":813,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/token-pocket_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":4,"contract_address":"0xeca41281c24451168a37211f0bc2b8645af45092","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xeca41281c24451168a37211f0bc2b8645af45092"}},"is_native":false}
