{"name":"Charged Particles","id":"charged-particles_ethereum","symbol":"ionx","description":"Charged Particles Charged Particles is a protocol that allows users to deposit ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 tokens into NFTs. A scarce NFT (e.g. Art, Collectible, Virtual Real Estate, In-Game Item, etc.) can now be transformed into a basket holding a number of other tokens. The Principal amount can be time-locked inside the NFT, and through integration with Aave’s aTokens, the programmable yield from these DeFi yield-generating assets is just a few clicks away.","links":"https://charged.fi/","market_cap":71183,"market_cap_rank":7607,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/charged-particles_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x02d3a27ac3f55d5d91fb0f52759842696a864217","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x02d3a27ac3f55d5d91fb0f52759842696a864217"}},"is_native":false}
