{"name":"StaykX","id":"staykx","symbol":"stx","description":"StaykX is a platform created by the XscapeNFT and OnChain Whales teams, with the objective of being the first ever Multi-Token Soft-Stayking platform on the XRPL. Providing decentralised stayking opportunities, the core concept is that you remain in control and custody of your own assets. No centralised pooling of your tokens, no fear of losing them, complete and utter control is handed to you. StaykX provides users the ability to earn a variety of XRPL tokens as well as XRP, all whilst holding their tokens in a self-custodial wallet.","links":"https://staykx.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/staykx/logo.png"}
