{"name":"Omnipair","id":"omnipair_solana","symbol":"omfg","description":"Omnipair is an immutable decentralized protocol that enables permissionless lending and margin trading on Solana without relying on external price oracles, governance votes, or asset whitelists. It introduces a Generalized Automated Market Maker (GAMM) model that unifies liquidity for both token swaps and lending within a single pool. This unified design maximizes capital efficiency and is purpose-built to support underserved long-tail assets that traditional platforms might overlook. In essence, Omnipair allows anyone to create a market for any SPL token pair, fulfilling the project’s vision that every asset can find a market.","links":"https://omnipair.fi/","market_cap":9475608,"market_cap_rank":1603,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/omnipair/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"omfgRBnxHsNJh6YeGbGAmWenNkenzsXyBXm3WDhmeta","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/omfgRBnxHsNJh6YeGbGAmWenNkenzsXyBXm3WDhmeta"}},"is_native":false}
