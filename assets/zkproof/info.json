Whatâ€™s next for your project? today is the first day we deployed and we have scheduled a very organized marketing plan for the upcoming days. and at the same time development for the launchpad continues (it is fully functional on the Ethereum chain, it will be possible to launch also on the zksync mainnet in the upcoming days) What can your token be used for? Our token will be used to pay for kyc and also pay for presales initiated on our launchpad.
