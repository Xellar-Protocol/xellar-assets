{"name":"stXAI","id":"stxai","symbol":"stxai","description":"stXAI is a liquid staking derivative of the XAI token, part of the broader XAI ecosystem. The XAI ecosystem is a Layer 3 gaming blockchain built on Arbitrum, designed to support decentralized gaming applications and infrastructure. XAI staking is highly attractive to users, offering up to 120% APR (10% monthly) in rewards. However, the conventional XAI staking system comes with significant drawbacksâ€”tokens are locked up for up to 180 days, and early redemptions can incur penalties as high as 75%. This can limit flexibility and access to funds, despite the high yield potential.","links":"https://novadash.io","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/stxai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xab5c23bdbe99d75a7ae4756e7ccefd0a97b37e78"}}}
