{"name":"Tripolar","id":"tripolar","symbol":"tripolar","description":"$TRIPOLAR is an algorithmic stable token pegged 1:1 to $xTRI on Aurora blockchain. $TRIPOLAR is our third pegged token in Polaris ecosystem with more tokens coming in the future. $TRIPOLAR also aims to become the primary utility token of the Aurora ecosystem. The selection, development, and deployment of the next generation of Aurora DeFi projects will be decided by those who holds our Governance token $SPOLAR. $TRIPOLAR token is designed to be used as a medium of exchange. The built-in stability mechanism in the protocol aims to maintain $TRIPOLAR's peg to 1 $xTRI token in the long run. $TRIPOLAR actively pegs via the algorithm, it does not mean it will be valued at 1 $xTRI all times as it is not collaterized. $TRIPOLAR is not to be confused for a crypto or fiat-backed stablecoin.","links":"https://polarisfinance.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/tripolar/logo.png"}
