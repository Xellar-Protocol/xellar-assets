{"name":"Ouro Governance Share","id":"ouro-governance-share","symbol":"ogs","description":"Ouro aims to create an inflation-proof store of value system on BSC, featuring Peer-to-Pool asset swaps. The project derives fiat inflations manifested in the growth of the value of crypto assets and migrates them onto OURO, making it inflation-proof against the USD. Ouro has an arbitrage-based stability mechanism. When assets in the Reserve Pool appreciate, Up to 30% of the excess value will be reserved for an increase in OUROâ€™s Default Exchange Price. OGS, or Ouro Governance Share, is used for community governance in Ouro. When any yield is generated from assets in the Reserve Pool, it will be used to improve liquidity for OGS trading pairs and to conduct OGS token burns. When assets in the Reserve Pool appreciate, at least 70% of the excess value will be used to conduct OGS token burns and the formation of Insurance Pool. New OGS will be minted when the Reserve Pool does not have enough assets to acquire collateral when the Reserve Pool does not have enough assets to keep a 1-1 peg with issued OURO. All OURO issued are backed by crypto assets in a 1-1 fashion. No need to worry about price fluctuation.","links":"https://ouro.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ouro-governance-share/logo.png"}
