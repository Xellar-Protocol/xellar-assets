{"name":"nuco.cloud","id":"nuco-cloud","symbol":"ncdt","description":"Nuco.cloud is described to be a sharing economy platform for network computing based on BOINC (Berkley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing), originally created by a team based at Space Science Laboratory in 2002 to support scientific research in need for large computing calculations. The project claims that its platform allows users to monetise unused computing power of their smartphone, computer or server through the easy and simple to use nuco.client app. Nuco.cloud connects users' computing power in to a decentralised “supercomputer” and sells it to the clients using a blockchain for instant payment in nuco token which users can further use to purchase our computing power or exchange it to other cryptocurrencies or FIAT (dollars, euros, pound sterling). Nuco.cloud is the first ever blockchain project which received a grant from the german government: https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/DE/INVEST-DB/iron-eagle-capital-gmbh.html Furthermore there is Nuco.compute, a professional version of nuco.cloud, designed for large enterprises and professional customers which brings more control over the features and an extra layer of security. Customers can choose specific hardware to be used, the latency, throughput, geographic location and the certificates of data security level. Calculations are only done by professional data centres with a high level of security.","links":"https://nuco.cloud/","market_cap":1415223,"market_cap_rank":3271,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nuco-cloud/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe0c8b298db4cffe05d1bea0bb1ba414522b33c1b"}}}
