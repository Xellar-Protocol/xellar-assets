{"name":"AIVOICE","id":"aivoice","symbol":"aiv","description":"Our project aims to use AI technology to enable multi-voice services, allowing users to choose to listen to all digital content, including Internet news, provided by AI voice platforms such as ChatGPT, Alexa, Siri, audiobooks, AI speakers, and portals in the voice of their preferred person. In simpler terms, this means that people will be able to choose the voice of a famous person they desire to listen to content through AI voice platforms like ChatGPT. If GPT provides the voices of celebrities and users can select a specific personâ€™s voice for content listening, it falls within the scope of our proprietary technology rights.","links":"https://ai-v.ai/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/aivoice/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x581c124d0f4b9d365c06e30d37ea8352d5f3a2af"}}}
