R is a decentralized USD stablecoin backed by liquid staking tokens like stETH (Lido Staked ETH) and rETH (Rocket Pool ETH). R aims to be the stablecoin of choice within the decentralized ecosystem, with deep liquidity across many trading pairs and a stable peg to the US dollar maintained through a combination of hard and soft peg mechanisms.","links":"https://www.raft.fi/","market_cap":98836,"market_cap_rank":6642,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/raft/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x4c5cb5d87709387f8821709f7a6664f00dcf0c93","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x4c5cb5d87709387f8821709f7a6664f00dcf0c93"}}}
