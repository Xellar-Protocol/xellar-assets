{"name":"Broge","id":"broge_base","symbol":"broge","description":"Originally Broge on Base was headed up by one developer. That developer divested or burned their tokens, and burned the initial LP. A few community members have put banded together to make Broge truly an open community token. A set of tenets has been created, the first of which is transparency, the second is that all members of the community have a voice in the ongoing development of the token. The third tenet is that all community-driven projects that can be will be open source. The final tenet is be chill, always. A first draft community white paper has been written and made available. There is a new web site. Community members have willingly airdropped their own tokens to raise awareness and adoption. There's new socials. Even a new mascot design.","links":"https://broge.meme/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/broge_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe8e55a847bb446d967ef92f4580162fb8f2d3f38","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xe8e55a847bb446d967ef92f4580162fb8f2d3f38"}},"is_native":false}
