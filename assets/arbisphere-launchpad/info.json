Shortly after the sale of our Launchpad and Governance token $ARSH, our Launchpad will host its first-ever launch, launching $SPHERE, the native token of Arbisphere's DEX. Our DEX will open its doors to all Arbitrum users, offering high but sustainable yields thanks to our tokenomics strategies starting on our ecosystem tokens $SPHERE-USDC, $SPHERE-ETH, $ARSH-ETH, $ARSH-USDC, the most traded pairs such as $ETH-USDC, $WBTC-USDC and on 3Pool $USDC-$USDT-$DAI in our Stable-Swap AMM.","links":"https://arbisphere.finance","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/arbisphere-launchpad/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x4e1b1c450cebc7a4e1561e8edd99a8c650dfb1a9"}}}
