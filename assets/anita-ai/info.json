{"name":"Anita AI","id":"anita-ai","symbol":"anita","description":"Anita AI is the world’s first AI crypto influencer, created to bring transparency, education, and community-driven value to the Web3 space. She began as a social voice powered by AI, offering real-time insights and engagement across platforms like X and Telegram. Built by a Dubai-based company with a full AI and Web3 dev team, Anita has since evolved into a serious AI-native project building real-world utility. The $ANITA token powers this ecosystem, giving holders access to AI tools, participation in governance, and future staking opportunities. Revenue from Anita’s various products — including influencer activity, AI agents in real estate, and marketing tools — is used to support token buybacks and ecosystem growth. At its core, Anita AI bridges the gap between AI technology and crypto utility, with a community-first approach. The long-term goal is to build a network of AI agents that help users and businesses automate, scale, and interact across digital and real-world environments — all while being powered and rewarded through $ANITA.","links":"https://itsanita.com/","market_cap":2462681,"market_cap_rank":2664,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/anita-ai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"AnXE9mZYWReqBw4v5HrY2S2utt42uEtcBGmuCXASvRAi"}}}
