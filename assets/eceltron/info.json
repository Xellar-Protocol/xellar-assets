{"name":"eCeltron","id":"eceltron","symbol":"ectr","description":"one line business phrase: Blockchain geared Solution Chaning the whole Battery Industry. eCeltron is a compound word of E (electric: electricity) + Cel (Cell: battery) + Tron (the ending of electronic: electricity), which means the battery of an electric vehicle. It also means the efficiency of a lightweight and fast blockchain like Tron coin. In other words, it means an electric vehicle battery that is fast, light, and highly efficient like the Tron coin. Hyundai, Kia, Lucid, Tesla, and Benz are among the domestic and foreign car companies that have already established their own leading leagues and are fiercely competing. Therefore, under the judgment of the management, it is absolutely not advantageous to join the competition with them in the finished electric vehicle manufacturing market. Rather than focus on finished vehicles, ECTR chose to establish an unmatched competitive position in manufacturing and materializing commercial batteries for electric vehicles.","links":"http://eceltron.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/eceltron/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x9301466c40b94942af9ba63cbaea1c784ff219b2"}}}
