{"name":"Unstable Tether","id":"unstable-tether_solana","symbol":"usdut","description":"💸 $USDUT – The First Unstable Tether The stablecoin your risk manager warned you about. Welcome to $USDUT – the world’s first unstable tether. Think of it as a stablecoin... if it got into DeFi, started drinking, and never looked back. Built for volatility. Fueled by memes. Priced at chaos. 🤡 What is $USDUT? $USDUT is a high-volatility meme coin that satirizes the idea of \"stability\" in crypto. It mimics the branding of stablecoins, but not the behavior. While other coins aim for $1, we shoot for $0.98, because that means the market is alive and the degens are winning. There’s no utility, no team, no promises, and absolutely no reason to buy it — except for the thrill of the ride and the spirit of pure, unfiltered crypto anarchy. 📉 Designed to Be Dangerous Unstable by design Profitable by accident Backed by nothing Powered by vibes This is not financial advice. This is financial performance art. 📊 DEX: DexScreener 🔗 CA: 3vz82EWYv8xnc7Cm7qSgERcpMeqw92PcX8PBz88npump 🎯 Status: Likely pumping.
