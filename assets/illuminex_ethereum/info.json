No matter which asset you use, you can store, send, and swap them privately. The mission of illumineX is to bring a convenient and compliant web wallet for on-chain privacy, where only one seed phrase is needed to manage many private multi-asset accounts. One account can hold assets from different chains without having a separate address for each chain. Each account has its own private address on the Oasis Privacy Layer, allowing illumineX to abstract all the complexity from the end user.","links":"https://illuminex.xyz/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/illuminex_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x45e82579792dddf08cb3a037086604c262d78065","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x45e82579792dddf08cb3a037086604c262d78065"}},"is_native":false}
