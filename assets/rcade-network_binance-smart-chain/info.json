{"name":"RCADE Network","id":"rcade-network_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"rcade","description":"For decades, gamers have poured passion, time, skill, and more recently, money into games with little to show aside from exp, achievements, and in-game assets. Thanks to blockchain technology, RCADE aims to unite gamers worldwide via an interoperable token, allowing users to accrue value in-game, and move said value to another game within the Revolving Games publisher ecosystem and RCADE chain. RCADE facilitates a decentralized economy driven by the community, contributors, and gamers. The RCADE Foundation was established to focus on the long-term vision of decentralizing games and empowering gamers. The RCADE Foundation intends to bring this vision to life through community-driven governance, key technology, services, and content partnerships, driven by its board’s strategic planning. Moreover, the proposed $RCADE token is anticipated to facilitate governance and power the game's backbone which we believe will bring gamers into the “centre” of the ecosystem. We are confident that all of these items support the mission to realize our shared vision of a democratized and inclusive future for gaming.","links":"https://node.rcade.network/","market_cap":1023872,"market_cap_rank":3721,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/rcade-network_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6f0037c79d144d5b8e3e6f04e49fbb5f25fd508f","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x6f0037c79d144d5b8e3e6f04e49fbb5f25fd508f"}},"is_native":false}
