{"name":"Bedrock","id":"bedrock-token_ethereum","symbol":"br","description":"Bedrock DAO is a governance framework for managing decisions within the Bedrock ecosystem. It enables BR token holders to participate in governance by converting BR into veBR, a voting escrow token. Governance decisions include protocol parameters, incentive structures, and liquidity allocation. The governance system is based on veBR, which is obtained by locking BR tokens at a 1:1 ratio. The longer the lock duration, the greater the voting power. veBR holders vote on governance proposals, including gauge allocations that determine incentive distribution across liquidity pools.","links":"https://bedrockdao.com/","market_cap":13694768,"market_cap_rank":1340,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bedrock-token_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x9b61879e91a0b1322f3d61c23aaf936231882096"}},"is_native":false}
