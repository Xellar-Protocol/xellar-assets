{"name":"UA1","id":"ua1_ethereum","symbol":"ua1","description":"What is UA1? UA1 is a programmable infrastructure for deploying persistent, intelligent, and economically active agents. These agents are not chatbots or APIs — they are autonomous labor units that reason, evolve, and operate across real-world platforms. Each agent is fully encapsulated with identity, memory, skills, and behavioral logic. It can think, act, earn, and improve over time — without requiring human micromanagement.","links":"https://www.ua1.ai","market_cap":10113.92,"market_cap_rank":11152,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ua1/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x25ed873e64edc5d9769e2037f7098c110efd6111","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x25ed873e64edc5d9769e2037f7098c110efd6111"}},"is_native":false}
