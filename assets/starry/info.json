{"name":"Starry","id":"starry","symbol":"starry","description":"$STARRY Token is a token which will bring liquidity into the NFT market through acquisitions of NFTs for a Treasury based on proposals suggested by $STARRY holders. A method of distribution will exist to send NFTs to community holders as well. Formulated by ex-LPs from Starry Night Capital the token and project is also focused on innovation in DeFi and memes. The STARRY smart contract, is designed with a specific governance and control mechanism in mind. Core Functionality - Blacklist: The only available owner function is to enable the blacklisting of certain addresses. This feature is to be used in the context of regulatory compliance or to maintain the integrity of STARRY preventing malicious or non-compliant participants. No Renounce Ownership Feature: STARRY is designed without the ability to renounce ownership. This is intended to remain with the initial owner (in this case, the STARRY dev team). This is a measure to ensure ongoing responsibility. Use Cases for Blacklisting: STARRY specifies that blacklisting will be used only for compliance with regulations like those from the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) or other dao voted blacklisting scenarios. This limitation indicates a commitment to legal compliance and ethical use of the blacklist function, avoiding arbitrary or unjustified exclusion of participants.","links":"https://starrynight.fi/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/starry/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8f602ee5b1f8de67120c427717cbe2770f3cf320"}}}
