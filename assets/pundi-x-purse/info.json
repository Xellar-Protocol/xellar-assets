{"name":"Pundi X PURSE","id":"pundi-x-purse","symbol":"purse","description":"$PURSE, the Pundi X reward token, is now available on both BEP20 and Pundi X Chain. The purpose of the token is to incentivize XPOS usage, expand Pundi X Chain’s ecosystem and increase $PUNDIX value through rewards, gamification (lucky draw / lottery), discount vouchers and redemption for NFTs and other tokens. $PURSE can be sent between Pundi X Chain and Binance Smart Chain. There’s no pre-minted tokens or allocation in any form for the team. All initial supply goes to $PUNDIX holders and for absorbing $NPXSXEM tokens, thus sunsetting our support for $NPXSXEM.","links":"https://pundix.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pundi-x-purse/logo.png"}
