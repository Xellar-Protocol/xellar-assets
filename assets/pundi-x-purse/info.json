{"name":"Pundi X PURSE","id":"pundi-x-purse","symbol":"purse","description":"$PURSE, the Pundi X reward token, is now available on both BEP20 and Pundi X Chain. The purpose of the token is to incentivize XPOS usage, expand Pundi X Chain’s ecosystem and increase $PUNDIX value through rewards, gamification (lucky draw / lottery), discount vouchers and redemption for NFTs and other tokens. $PURSE can be sent between Pundi X Chain and Binance Smart Chain. There’s no pre-minted tokens or allocation in any form for the team. All initial supply goes to $PUNDIX holders and for absorbing $NPXSXEM tokens, thus sunsetting our support for $NPXSXEM.","links":"https://purse.land/","market_cap":4052647,"market_cap_rank":2038,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pundi-x-purse/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x29a63f4b209c29b4dc47f06ffa896f32667dad2c"},"function-x":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x5fd55a1b9fc24967c4db09c513c3ba0dfa7ff687"},"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x95987b0cdc7f65d989a30b3b7132a38388c548eb"}}}
