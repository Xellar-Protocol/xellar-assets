{"name":"zkRune","id":"zkrune_solana","symbol":"zkrune","description":"What is zkRune? zkRune is a visual Zero-Knowledge Proof builder that makes privacy-preserving technology accessible to everyone - no cryptography expertise required. Prove facts without revealing sensitive data: • Age Verification: Prove you're 18+ without showing your birth date • Balance Proof: Prove sufficient funds without exposing your exact amount • Anonymous Voting: Cast votes with verifiable results while maintaining voter privacy • Private Membership: Verify group membership without revealing your identity • Range Proofs: Prove a value falls within a range without disclosing the actual number How it works: zkRune uses real Groth16 zk-SNARKs (the same cryptography securing major blockchains) but makes them simple. Our visual circuit builder lets you create custom privacy proofs through drag-and-drop - no coding, no command line, no servers. Key features: • 100% Client-Side: All cryptographic operations run in your browser. Your private data never leaves your device. • Works Offline: Install as a PWA on your phone. Generate proofs on airplane mode. • No Setup Required: No wallets, no accounts, no API keys. Just visit and use. • Real Cryptography: Not simulations - mathematically verifiable zero-knowledge proofs. • Open Source: Fully transparent and auditable code. Perfect for: Developers building privacy features, organizations needing compliance without data exposure, and anyone who values digital privacy. Built for the Zcash ecosystem","links":"https://zkrune.com","market_cap":46166,"market_cap_rank":8336,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/zkrune_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"51mxznNWNBHh6iZWwNHBokoaxHYS2Amds1hhLGXkpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/51mxznNWNBHh6iZWwNHBokoaxHYS2Amds1hhLGXkpump"}},"is_native":false}
