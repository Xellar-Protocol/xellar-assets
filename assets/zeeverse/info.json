Zeeverse roadmap for 2023 - https://bit.ly/3SiMrLJ The in-game incentive system is based on a principle by which players must spend $VEE on in-game upgrades to earn more $VEE in PvE. The higher the level, the more expensive the upgrades become - this gradually increases $VEE demand from the top down. The difference between $VEE distributed in rewards and collected from upgrades results in a margin that fuels $VEE reserves. Players unlock more lucrative rewards in addition to $VEE at a higher Zee level, moving the focus from $VEE farming to new resources and items like Voxels on Zee Islands and Exotic Zee Eggs in high-level Team PvE Dungeons.","links":"https://zee-verse.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/zeeverse/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x7616113782aadab041d7b10d474f8a0c04eff258"}}}
