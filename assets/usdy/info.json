{"name":"YSL USDy","id":"usdy","symbol":"usdy","description":"USDy is a key component of the YSL.IO ecosystem, designed to maintain price stability and ensure sustainable liquidity growth. The protocol features a unique Price Stability Model and an autonomous USDy-USDC Treasury-Owned Liquidity generation mechanism, which together help counteract selling pressure and increase liquidity. The USDy Buyback and Burn (UBB) mechanism activates every 4 epochs if the USDy-USDC pool price falls below $0.95. During UBB activation, a portion of the tax from every YSL, xYSL, bYSL, and USDy trade, along with 15% of every HydraVault deposit, is used to purchase and burn USDy. This reduces the USDy supply and increases its price, benefiting USDy holders. Additionally, the USDy Incentive Buyback (UIB) mechanism offers a 25% incentive to purchase YSL while actively reducing the USDy supply. During UIB activation, the protocol performs an automated buyback and burn of USDy using the USDC received from YSL purchases. Users receive YSL and a 25% bonus in USDy, but the UIB is only in effect while the UBB is active and USDy is trading at a maximum of $1.05. In summary, USDy plays a crucial role in maintaining price stability and fostering sustainable growth within the YSL.IO ecosystem. Its innovative UBB and UIB mechanisms work together to ensure that the protocol remains resilient against market fluctuations and offers long-term value to its users.","links":"https://ysl.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/usdy/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x45d486479ed1db8b164d1386b3c89c05cee8ca86"}}}
