And as the backbone of an entirely new creative paradigm for tokenized art, $FXH is much more than just an airdrop.The protocol introduces three visionary components that merge art + finance: $FXH token, art coins, open-form. You can use $FXH to launch or participate in art coin launches, collect and interact with open-form projects, provide liquidity, or hold for governance rights as the protocol evolves. The $FXH protocol and first open-form collection launch in June, with more to follow. Roadmap?
