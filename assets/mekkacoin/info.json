{"name":"MekkaCoin","id":"mekkacoin","symbol":"mek","description":"Mekka Froggo is a collection of 1,111 NFTs that features the world's first gamified staking wars system where holders can fight for a share of MekkaCoin ($MEK). Froggos can increase their $MEK earning rate by training their NFT or locking their NFTs for 10- or 30-day periods. $MEK earning rate is also influenced by rare traits and by the alliance that wins the daily staking war. $MEK is used within the Mekka ecosystem of tools, beginning with Mekka Stake, a SaaS NFT staking platform creator that offers a 10% discount to users to spend $MEK to be onboarded to Mekka Stake. It will also be used for transaction fees in the secure Mekka Wallet, which turns every smartphone into a ledger.","links":"https://www.mekkalab.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mekkacoin/logo.png"}
