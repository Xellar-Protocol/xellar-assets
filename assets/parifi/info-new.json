{"name":"Parifi","id":"parifi","symbol":"prf","description":"Parifi is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that offers a perpetual trading protocol with an advanced adaptive pricing mechanism. It operates on a blockchain to provide a transparent, secure, and equitable trading environment. Parifi's distinct pricing model leverages on-chain oracles and employs liquidity curves, which adjust dynamically based on market conditions and asset risk profiles, to offer more stable and predictable pricing for perpetual contracts. This innovative approach addresses common DeFi inefficiencies such as front-running and price slippage, aiming to enhance the user experience for both traders and liquidity providers.","links":"https://parifi.org/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/parifi/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xcffcfdada28ab44d5440301470dcd410e75c4765"},"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x1310952bc5594852459ee45bfd0df70b34ac5509"}}}
