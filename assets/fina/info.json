History of your project. - Wallet Launch (Accomplished as of August 25th, 2022) - Validator Launch (Accomplished as of September 24th, 2022) - Acquisition of Cryptocurrency Exchange License in Lithuania (Accomplished as of September 29th, 2022) - Fina Card Beta Launch (Accomplished as of March 10th, 2023) - Public Sale of FINA Tokens (May 2023) Whatâ€™s next for your project? After the token launch, we will aim to extend our service to various L2 blockchains in order to gain market share and earn more fees in core businesses. We believed that all core products can be replicated to other chains and occur +ve cash flow for the project as a whole. As a result, the reverse can be used to buy back $FINA which sustains a fairly long-term value for the token.","links":"https://fina.cash/","market_cap":761913,"market_cap_rank":2903,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/fina/logo.png","detail_platform":{"secret":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"secret1s3z9xkpdsrhk86300tqnv6u466jmdmlegew2ve"}}}
