{"name":"Stride Staked Luna","id":"stride-staked-luna","symbol":"$stluna","description":"stLUNA functions as a liquid staking token, representing LUNA, the primary token of Terra, a prominent Cosmwasm-powered smart contract chain within the Cosmos ecosystem. Through Stride's liquid staking mechanism, users can convert staked LUNA into stLUNA, enabling participation in DeFi activities while earning a 14.39% staking reward. By staking LUNA with Stride, users can earn stLUNA, which are redeemable for INJ at a 1:1 ratio, subject to the unbonding period on LUNA. This token is integrated in in leading Cosmos DeFi applications, including Astroport, Demex, and Carbon Nitron, offering practical utility and broadening engagement options across the Cosmos ecosystem. Stride is a multichain liquid staking zone (appchain) on the Cosmos Blockchain. Stride allows users to stake any IBC-compatible tokens, and receive stTokens in return, which are redeemable for the original token at a 1:1 ratio. By staking their tokens using Stride, users will be able to earn staking rewards, while also retaining liquidity in the form of stTokens, which will allow them to take advantage of Cosmos DeFi and pursue more yields there.","links":"https://stride.zone/","market_cap":155349,"market_cap_rank":3704,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/stride-staked-luna/logo.png","detail_platform":{"terra-2":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":"ibc/08095CEDEA29977C9DD0CE9A48329FDA622C183359D5F90CF04CC4FF80CBE431"}}}
