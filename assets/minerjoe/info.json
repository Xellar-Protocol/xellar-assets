{"name":"MinerJoe","id":"minerjoe","symbol":"gold","description":"Our 10,000 algorithmically generated, unique Miners are no ordinary NFTs. MinerJoe is a complete ecosystem, inclusive of Tri-Token architecture, structured entirely around our limited supply of NFTs. This awesome architecture is designed to create a perpetual value-loop for our Miners. MinerJoe is an ecosystem, which starts with an NFT. This NFT is a gold miner. He can be \"staked\" and will be rewarded with $gold, a token. $gold can be staked, or as we call it \"banked\" to earn $credits, another token. $credits can be used to upgrade the NFT metadata and make him mine $gold faster.","links":"https://minerjoe.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/minerjoe/logo.png"}
