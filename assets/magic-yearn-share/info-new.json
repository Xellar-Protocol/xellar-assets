{"name":"Magic Yearn Share","id":"magic-yearn-share","symbol":"mys","description":"Magic Yearn's ecosystem relies on pegged tokens and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) to drive its operations. One of the unique features of Magic Yearn is its innovative approach to single staking. Users can now stake/burn some MyS tokens to mint an MyNFT. This MyNFT will then receive rewards similar to single staking. In addition to this, Magic Yearn also offers pegged reflection tokens known as myXXX tokens. For instance, if you hold myBTC, you'll receive reflection rewards from myBTC transaction fees. MyS tokens, on the other hand, are the utility tokens of the Magic Yearn ecosystem. These tokens can be used to mint MyNFTs and also to reduce transaction fees associated with myXXX tokens. Overall, Magic Yearn's ecosystem is built to provide users with a seamless and rewarding experience. Whether you're interested in staking, reflection tokens, or NFTs, Magic Yearn has something for everyone!","links":"https://magicyearn.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/magic-yearn-share/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x021f48697343a6396bafc01795a4c140b637f4b4"}}}
