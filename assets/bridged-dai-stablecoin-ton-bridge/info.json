{"name":"Bridged Dai Stablecoin (TON Bridge)","id":"bridged-dai-stablecoin-ton-bridge","symbol":"jdai","description":"jDAI is a token on the TON blockchain bridged from the Ethereum blockchain via bridge.ton.org. Bridged DAI (TON Bridge) allows for DAI transfers to be conducted quicker on the TON blockchain and opens up the possibility for DAI to be used in the TON ecosystem. Dai is the native MKR and its first stablecoin iteration known as the Single Collateral Dai (SAI), which used Ether (ETH) as collateral. Two years later in 2019, the Foundation released the Multi-Collateral Dai (DAI), phasing out SAI. The platform has enjoyed widespread adoption and is the largest decentralized lending platform with around $2.58 billion in total value locked (TVL), as of December 2020.","links":"https://bridge.ton.org/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bridged-dai-stablecoin-ton-bridge/logo.png","detail_platform":{"the-open-network":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"EQDo_ZJyQ_YqBzBwbVpMmhbhIddKtRP99HugZJ14aFscxi7B"}}}
