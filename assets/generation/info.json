{"name":"Generation","id":"generation","symbol":"gen","description":"GEN intends to actively support the three values of 'freedom', 'sovereignty', and 'decentralization' while composing the Web 3.0 ecosystem. The first 'freedom' guarantees 'freedom' of expression and the privacy of data by utilizing blockchain. The second 'sovereignty' allows users to strengthen and own the 'data sovereignty' in the Generation ecosystem in line with the Web 3.0 era and obtain rewards by using it. The third 'decentralization' utilizes Generation Protocol to operate decentralized networks and assets. Through these three values, users can experience the true Web 3.0 and become members of the GEN ecosystem.","links":"https://gen.foundation/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/generation/logo.png"}
