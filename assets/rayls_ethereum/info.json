{"name":"Rayls","id":"rayls_ethereum","symbol":"rls","description":"Rayls is a Layer-1 blockchain ecosystem designed for financial institutions to bridge traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). Developed by Parfin, Rayls combines a public chain, private networks, and institutional privacy nodes into a unified infrastructure that supports compliant, scalable, and privacy-preserving asset tokenization and settlement. Its architecture connects regulated banks and payment systems with public DeFi liquidity while maintaining confidentiality through the Rayls Enygma privacy protocol. The network enables tokenization of real-world assets, CBDCs, and stablecoins using EVM-compatible technology, fixed USD-pegged gas fees, deterministic finality, and harmful MEV protection.","links":"https://www.rayls.com/","market_cap":24355974,"market_cap_rank":1004,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/rayls_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb5f7b021a78f470d31d762c1dda05ea549904fbd","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xb5f7b021a78f470d31d762c1dda05ea549904fbd"}},"is_native":false}
