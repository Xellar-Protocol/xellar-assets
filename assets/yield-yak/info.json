Our community compounds rewards, suggests new strategies, proposes key configuration updates and contributes to development. Yield Yak farms can run forever, without the team's involvement. Staked $YAK will receive $AVAX. YY network revenue (collected in tokens, usually) will be converted to AVAX and distributed to stakers.","links":"https://yieldyak.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/yield-yak/logo.png"}
