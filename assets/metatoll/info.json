{"name":"MetaToll","id":"metatoll","symbol":"tax","description":"MetaToll or $TAX, is our Toll currency token (also to be synonymous with a “riff”). Circulating supply from listing will be 1,000,000,000,000 (one trillion). The total supply will only increase as P2A tokens are burned. Tokens will be burned upon disbursement of funds from MetaTariff to each respective governing body. Upon live adoption date all tokens sent in the P2A transactions will go into the possession of the administrator (MetaTariff) and they will be held in escrow until liquidated. At no point do these tokens become the property of the administrator, even if unclaimed. Liquidation will be done according to disbursement to the governing bodies depending upon their choice of currency (subject to negotiation with governing bodies but MetaTariff reserves the right to offer fiat to be available initially with a goal to move completely to cryptocurrency at a later agreed upon date between the DAO and regulators). At no point can any $TAX tokens in escrow be redistributed or refunded. Upon conversion and liquidation, the $TAX tokens will be burnt. Redistribution of new supply will be completed in the same amount that was burned with an additional new supply to be added upon assessment or on an as needed basis agreed upon by the DAO.
