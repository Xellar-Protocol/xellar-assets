{"name":"SENATE","id":"senate","symbol":"senate","description":"The SENATE token is used by the in-game mechanics as a governance coin as well as in-game currency for certain products within the game. The voting system implemented uses third-party solutions and/or specially designed contracts. Users who hold SENATE tokens will be able to: * Create factions and manage them by holding votes. * Take part in project level voting to steer the game development process, the purchase of game items, etc. * Purchase space ships, modules for space stations and land plots (which is not possible with the SIDUS token).","links":"https://sidusheroes.com/","market_cap":5267240,"market_cap_rank":1850,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/senate/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x34be5b8c30ee4fde069dc878989686abe9884470"}}}
