{"name":"Router Protocol","id":"router-protocol-2_ethereum","symbol":"route","description":"Router Protocol is an open and permissionless onchain swap network designed to make liquidity move freely across chains. By aggregating available liquidity sources and splitting across them, it ensures users always get the best price across chains and trade sizes. Built on the Open Graph Architecture (OGA), Router connects bridges, DEXs, and liquidity networks into a unified routing layer, enabling faster, simpler, and more efficient onchain execution for both users and builders.","links":"https://www.routerprotocol.com/","market_cap":1087007,"market_cap_rank":3657,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/router-protocol-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x60f67e1015b3f069dd4358a78c38f83fe3a667a9","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x60f67e1015b3f069dd4358a78c38f83fe3a667a9"}},"is_native":false}
