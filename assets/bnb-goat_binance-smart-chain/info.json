{"name":"BNB GOAT","id":"bnb-goat_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"bgoat","description":"BNB GOAT ($BGOAT) is a community-driven token on the BNB Chain (BEP-20) that integrates meme culture with a utility-focused ecosystem. The project is designed to address the common lack of long-term utility in community tokens by providing tangible use cases for its holders and supporting content creators. ​The core utilities planned for the $BGOAT token include governance rights within a future Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), staking opportunities for rewards, and access to a creator grants program funded by the ecosystem's treasury. Additionally, token holders can receive marketplace privileges, such as fee discounts and verification badges within community channels. ​Governance is designed to be progressively decentralized, allowing token holders to vote on proposals related to grants and protocol parameters. To promote security and transparency, the project operates with a verified smart contract on BscScan and plans to implement a multi-signature wallet for managing treasury funds. The overall mission is to build a sustainable, community-run ecosystem that moves beyond pure speculation towards practical application and creator support.","links":"https://thebnbgoat.com/","market_cap":4833.98,"market_cap_rank":12414,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bnb-goat_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x88883075fb050f4199cf7b2011cc15f1c966403f","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x88883075fb050f4199cf7b2011cc15f1c966403f"}},"is_native":false}
