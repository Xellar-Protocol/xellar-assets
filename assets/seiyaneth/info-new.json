{"name":"seiyanETH","id":"seiyaneth","symbol":"seth","description":"sETH is a Sei-native ETH LST that delivers DeFi’s highest ETH staking yield to Sei users and builders. By minting sETH, users gain access to the yields available to apxETH holders on Ethereum mainnet—without leaving the Sei network. sETH is an “index token” designed to appreciate in value against ETH over time. When users withdraw back to ETH, the accumulated yield is included automatically. No need to track rebases or wrap tokens—just use sETH in DeFi on Sei as you normally would.","links":"https://sei.dinero.xyz/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/seiyaneth/logo.png","detail_platform":{"sei-v2":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x9faaea2cdd810b21594e54309dc847842ae301ce"}}}
