{"name":"boom.fun","id":"boom-fun","symbol":"boom","description":"Boom.fun is an Ethereum-native launchpad and decentralized exchange (DEX) engineered to capture the $150 M+ per-month memecoin trading craze while turning every new coin into rocket fuel for the $BOOM token. By pairing all launches with $BOOM, streaming launches live, and unleashing an AI meme-hunter that ships fresh tokens daily, Boom.fun is positioned to outpace—and ultimately out-earn—the Solana phenomenon Pump.fun. Additionally, devs can set a tax on their coins to sustain the project from volume fees instead of token sales & can opt into our “Safe Badge”, with buys being automatically vested over time to prevent early buyers from dumping.","links":"https://boom.fun","market_cap":77092,"market_cap_rank":6989,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/boom-fun/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x48e205eb6db302a6e50d292cd382f6251d9a25cd","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x48e205eb6db302a6e50d292cd382f6251d9a25cd"}}}
