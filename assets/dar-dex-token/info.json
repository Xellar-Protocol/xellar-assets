{"name":"Dar Dex","id":"dar-dex-token","symbol":"dut","description":"DARDEX Token (DDT) is a BSC utility token that includes the DEX Platform, DARDEX. DDT was launched on the BSC platform and has a 100 Billion max supply on the BSC blockchain. Holders of DDT that have a set limit subject to change based on price action movement will have access to multiple features on the DEX platform. Holders will be entitled to ten percent of the DARDEX Platform revenue stream that will be equally distributed among the community. There is a five percent tax on sellers and buyers and the tokenomics are as follows: We will use one percent to redistribute among the holders which will allow new members to participate and gain more DDT as holders. Two percent will go towards marketing and charities. Red Panda has partnered with us and is our first charitable outreach along with law enforcement charities. Finally, Two percent will be allocated to the DEV Team. The DARDEX Platform contains a four multi-chain dexswap aggregator and will allow tokens regardless of audit status (ie, CRAP Tokens). It will include a search tool that labels the token according to the audit process results. Tokens will be labeled “Not Vetted”, “DAR Approved,” OR “Buyer Beware” in order to give investors an insight to the validity of the token.","links":"https://dartoken.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dar-dex-token/logo.png"}
