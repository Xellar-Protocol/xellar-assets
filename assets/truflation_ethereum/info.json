As such, it is responsible for the network, computation and storage layers of the protocol. TSN is a stand-alone byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) network designed to facilitate the development of innovative data-driven web3 applications. The availability of data is guaranteed by our network of node operators, as well as individual customers and asset managers.
