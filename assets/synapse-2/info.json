By providing decentralized, permissionless transactions between any L1, sidechain, or L2 ecosystem, Synapse powers integral blockchain activities such as asset transfers, swaps, and generalized messaging with cross-chain functionality - and in so doing enables new primitives based off of its cross-chain architecture. At Synapse you can bridge and swap stable assets between chains and provide liquidity to fuel cross-chain swapping in pools with minimal impermanent loss.","links":"https://synapseprotocol.com","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/synapse-2/logo.png"}
