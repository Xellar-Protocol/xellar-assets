TRG is the core & a standard , ERC 20 token. On top of this, there are 10 game tokens which spell out - The Rug Game $T $H $E $R $U $G $G* $A $M $E* All of the 10 gaming tokens have a 4% tax. 1% buys and burns CULT, 1% which buys & burns TRG, 1% game token sent to burn wallet & 1% which is collected by a contract & held in ETH. All of these tokens will launch at once, and after 30 days the game begins. Between every 30-60 days the token which has burnt the least amount numerically of the gaming token, CULT , and TRG is eliminated, and the liquidity is rugged automatically. Any ETH left from the LP at the time of the rug will auto buyback TRG and send it to the TRG DAO & stakers. At the time the token with the least burns rugs, the 1% ETH collected of every other community token is sent as ETH rewards to the winning community tokens holders. A communities corruption can be their saviour. They may make offerings to the DAO to sway the points in their favour. Any wallet can stake TRG. Any wallet that holds TRG or CULT can offer a bribe to the DAO. If a wallet sacrifices their TRG or CULT, they can allocate that amount that amount of “points” to a game token of their choosing. 50% of the bribe is then paid to TRG or CULT stakers dependent on token offered whilst 50% is burned.","links":"https://theruggame.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/t/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x5b985b4f827072febe33091b42729522b557bba1"}}}
