{"name":"3air","id":"3air","symbol":"3air","description":"3air is the worldâ€™s first blockchain platform that brings millions of unconnected users online and into blockchain and crypto. Initially, 3air solves the connectivity issues faced in Africa using a proprietary solution that provides high-speed broadband internet wirelessly. Once connected, our blockchain platform empowers users to become financially independent through DeFi, banking, micro-loans, and earning mechanisms. A sharing economy is being built around the high-speed connectivity using Access Point Operators (Nodes) to: * allow affordable connectivity for everyone * include the end user as partial owner of the infrastructure to accelerate coverage * provide a revenue stream from users paying for the internet, TV and Telephony services. After bringing users online, 3air aims to provide comprehensive financial services through its platform including: - Standardized Digital Identities, - Custodial/noncustodial wallets, - Fiat onboarding/offloading, - DeFi and more.","links":"https://3air.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/3air/logo.png"}
