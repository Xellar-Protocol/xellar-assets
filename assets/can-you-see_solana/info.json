{"name":"can you see?","id":"can-you-see_solana","symbol":"moon","description":"Moon (MOON) is a cryptocurrency launched on the Solana blockchain, designed as a unique experiment to bridge the gap between degens and the art community. Moon is integrated with Echow, an NFT platform that combines art with innovative market dynamics, such as bonding curves. The token has a deflationary mechanism where revenues from the platform are used to buy and burn Moon, supporting its utility and reducing its circulating supply.","links":"https://echow.xyz","market_cap":12457.74,"market_cap_rank":10725,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/can-you-see_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"6fYLNrp7ymmNy2kJnqJNFDpbSkyzQdS6i4kwfe5kpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/6fYLNrp7ymmNy2kJnqJNFDpbSkyzQdS6i4kwfe5kpump"}},"is_native":false}
