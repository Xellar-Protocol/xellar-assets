{"name":"Mononoke Inu","id":"mononoke-inu-2_ethereum","symbol":"mononoke","description":"Mononoke Inu is not here to promise complicated utilities, boring roadmaps, or unrealistic future tech. It’s a pure memecoin, born entirely for the culture, the laughs, and the community. Just like the legendary memes that spread without logic but capture the internet’s heart, MONONOKE exists to be shared, talked about, and memed endlessly. This coin doesn’t pretend to solve world hunger or reinvent finance—it embraces its zero-utility identity with pride. Its value comes from the people who believe in the joke, the fun, and the collective chaos of meme culture. The more it spreads, the stronger it becomes, not because of code or partnerships, but because of community energy. MONONOKE thrives on hype, creativity, and storytelling. The name itself, “Mononoke Inu,” plays into the familiar “Inu” meme coin family while adding a mysterious, legendary twist. It’s designed to be weird, funny, and unpredictable—the exact qualities that make memecoins go viral. In the end, MONONOKE is a reminder that crypto doesn’t always have to be serious. Sometimes, it’s about the meme, the vibe, and being part of an inside joke that the whole world eventually hears about.","links":"https://mononokeinu.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mononoke-inu-2_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x35889b9e7bb4d2890eb346ac243297a1b05f87ce","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x35889b9e7bb4d2890eb346ac243297a1b05f87ce"}},"is_native":false}
