{"name":"Garden","id":"garden-2","symbol":"seed","description":"Garden is a cross-chain bridge enabling fast and efficient Bitcoin swaps. It is built using Catalog protocol which uses atomic swaps to facilitate trustless conversions. These swaps are entirely peer-to-peer, removing the need for any wrapping/unwrapping or AMMs. Garden launched in December 2023, with support for BTC to WBTC swaps on Ethereum. It has since expanded to Arbitrum, with more chains in the pipeline.","links":"https://garden.finance","market_cap":3307373,"market_cap_rank":2034,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/garden-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x5eed99d066a8caf10f3e4327c1b3d8b673485eed"},"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x86f65121804d2cdbef79f9f072d4e0c2eebabc08"}}}
