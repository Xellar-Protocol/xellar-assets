{"name":"FOLKS","id":"folks_polygon-pos","symbol":"folks","description":"Folks Finance is a crosschain decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that enables users to supply, borrow, and manage digital assets across multiple blockchains from a single platform. By using interoperability technology like Chainlink CCIP, Circle CCTP, and Wormhole messaging, the protocol eliminates the need for wrapping, bridging, or splitting liquidity, allowing users to access unified pools and collateralize assets natively across ecosystems. Its design focuses on efficiency, security, and accessibility for both retail users and institutions.","links":"https://folks.finance","market_cap":82839419,"market_cap_rank":475,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/folks_polygon-pos/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0xff7f8f301f7a706e3cfd3d2275f5dc0b9ee8009b","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/polygon_pos/tokens/0xff7f8f301f7a706e3cfd3d2275f5dc0b9ee8009b"}},"is_native":false}
