{"name":"ShibWallet","id":"shibwallet","symbol":"swt","description":"ShibWallet project, an end-to-end wallet and bridge ecosystem for transferring tokens from various chains, powered by the SWT token. This project will be developed on the soon-to-be-launched Shibarium blockchain, but the token will be launched on the Ethereum blockchain first. This paper aims to present a detailed description of the project and its vision, including the role of tokenomics, roadmap, and marketing strategy. Currently, there is a wide variety of tokens available on different chains, making it difficult to exchange and transfer tokens. ShibWallet aims to solve this problem by developing a platform that allows tokens from various chains to be transferred easily and quickly. Also ShibWallet will also offer a secure and easy-to-use wallet that allows users to store, send and receive different types of tokens with a digital wallet that allows users to store, send and receive any type of tokens mainly from the SHIBARIUM chain. In the context of the Shibwallet, a bridge could be used to transfer the Shib token between Ethereum and other blockchains. For example, if Shibwallet implements a Cross-Chain bridge, users could transfer their Shibarium tokens to any type of chain. By using a bridge, users could take advantage of each blockchain. For example, Ethereum is known for its security and robustness, while Binance Smart Chain is known for its speed and low cost. By allowing the transfer of tokens between both blockchains, Shibwallet could offer users a richer and more flexible experience. In addition, the bridge charges a fee for each transaction, as mentioned above, this could generate additional revenue for Shibwallet and potentially distribute it to Shib token holders in proportion to their stake. In summary, the integration of a bridge in Shibwallet could improve the accessibility and utility of the Shib token, and potentially generate additional revenue for its holders. Utility: Wallet + Bridge is Live.","links":"https://www.shibwallet.app","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/shibwallet/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x1f05dee43df9fd0cd7f4b011b20b04870a30c29a"}}}
