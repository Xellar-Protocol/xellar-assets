{"name":"Crome","id":"crome-2_ethereum","symbol":"crome","description":"CROME introduces the first tokenized liquid agents, a new class of intelligent on-chain asset built on the ERC-LA standard. By merging the fungibility of ERC-20 tokens with the programmability of ERC-6551, each CROME token carries its own wallet, memory, and autonomous behavior. These liquid agents are capable of executing on-chain instructions, referencing and coordinating with other agents, and forming recursive structures or swarm-based intelligence systems. With the ability to act independently while remaining composable, CROME enables a new paradigm of programmable intelligence on-chain. This creates groundbreaking possibilities across DeFi, governance, and autonomous digital ecosystems, positioning CROME as the foundation for a future of intelligent, self-operating blockchain assets.","links":"https://crome.pro/","market_cap":8184.93,"market_cap_rank":11561,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/crome-2_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xceaebf7cc8b675f1a558dd2f6521b93a7237e6b3","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xceaebf7cc8b675f1a558dd2f6521b93a7237e6b3"}},"is_native":false}
