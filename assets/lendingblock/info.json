{"name":"Lendingblock","id":"lendingblock","symbol":"lnd","description":"Lendingblock (LND) is the governance and utility token used on the Lendingblock platform. Platform holders of LND are able to qualify for tiered rate bonuses or discounts, making it cheaper to borrow and boosting returns on deposits. In future, it is planned that platform users will be able to pay and receive interest in LND and use it as a form of collateral to enable stablecoin borrowing. LND will also be used in platform governance, where holders of LND are able to vote on future platform developments such as feature enhancements and asset prioritization. Finally, platform holders of LND will receive monthly LND airdrops depending on their lending and borrowing activity and their share of LND held on the platform.
