{"name":"Skate","id":"skate_ethereum","symbol":"skate","description":"Skate is a multi-VM infrastructure project that lets any decentralized application run seamlessly across multiple blockchains—both EVM and alternative VMs. It also provides native access to VM-specific applications on other chains, so EVM apps can operate directly within SVM or MOVE environments .
