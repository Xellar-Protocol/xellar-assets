{"name":"Chrystal","id":"chrystal","symbol":"chrystal","description":"Chrystal, the venerable elder of Freedom Farm, left us on March 7, 2024. She was not only the oldest but also a dear friend to Cheyenne, sharing countless moments of companionship. Now, we believe she has reunited with her dear friends Pnut and Fred in a better place. Please join us to honor her memory, reflect on her life, and continue her legacy by contributing to the well-being of all the animals at Freedom Farm. Let's come together to celebrate Chrystal's life and enhance the lives of those who remain.","links":"https://chrystalcto.com/","market_cap":6382.88,"market_cap_rank":9983,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/chrystal/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"BgHqzJCeSREccnbHwfH5GvgxPTDaabYpvBhfeZRzpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/BgHqzJCeSREccnbHwfH5GvgxPTDaabYpvBhfeZRzpump"}}}
