{"name":"MINE COIN","id":"mine-coin","symbol":"mih","description":"MIH is a next-generation payment platform that merges traditional PG (Payment Gateway) infrastructure with DeFi (Decentralized Finance) innovation. By integrating blockchain’s security and transparency with the familiarity of conventional payment tools like credit cards, MIH creates a more efficient, low-cost, and reward-driven payment ecosystem. This hybrid model offers faster settlements and reduced fees, benefiting both users and merchants. A key partnership with Korea’s largest digital gift certificate provider, Partner Store, enhances MIH’s early utility by allowing users to spend $MIH on a wide range of vouchers and coupons, bridging the gap between crypto and real-world commerce.","links":"https://mineholdings.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mine-coin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x27fc525dc7393a3219bbe8c93b6226e448f52fdf","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x27fc525dc7393a3219bbe8c93b6226e448f52fdf"}}}
