{"name":"StaFi Staked BNB","id":"stafi-staked-bnb","symbol":"rbnb","description":"What is the project about? rBNB, a decentralized DeFi product produced by StaFi that solves the liquidity problem of staked BNB on Binance Chain mainnet. rBNB token is a synthetic staking derivative issued by StaFi when they stake BNB through the StaFi rBNB App. rBNB tokens are anchored to the staked BNB assets and the corresponding staking rewards. rBNB tokens can be transferred and traded at any time. What makes your project unique? rBNB App can help BNB stakers solve two major issues: - There will be no need to wait for 7 days to unbond the staked BNB assets. Users can transfer, mortgage, and trade rBNB assets at any time to liberate liquidity and hedge price risks. - There is no need to learn the complicated Binance Chain’s Tendermint BFT consensus mechanism or staking reward calculation rules if you want to maximize staking rewards. With the rBNB App, users only need to follow a few steps to deposit BNB into the rBNB contract, which will automatically select the best validator for delegation by the rewards maximization strategy. History of your project. StaFi has launched rETH, rMATIC, rSOL, rATOM, rBNB, and other tokens to solve the liquidity problem. What’s next for your project? What can your token be used for? rBNB can be swapped for BNB and other rToken in a DEX.","links":"https://www.stafi.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/stafi-staked-bnb/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf027e525d491ef6ffcc478555fbb3cfabb3406a6"}}}
