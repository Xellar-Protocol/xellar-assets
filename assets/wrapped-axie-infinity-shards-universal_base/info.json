AXS is an Ethereum token that powers Axie Infinity, a blockchain-based game where players can battle, collect, and build a digital kingdom for their pets. Universal is a cross-chain asset protocol that enables users to trade and utilize wrapped assets (uAssets) across multiple blockchains. uAssets are 1:1 backed representations of native cryptocurrencies, such as XRP, DOGE, and SUI, held in secure custody. This allows users to access and transact with assets that are not natively available on their preferred chains, without relying on bridges or centralized exchanges. Universal provides seamless trading, liquidity provision, and lending opportunities for uAssets, ensuring deep liquidity and security through institutional-grade custody and real-time proof of reserves.","links":"https://www.universal.xyz/tokens/uAXS","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wrapped-axie-infinity-shards-universal_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x5a03841c2e2f5811f9e548cf98e88e878e55d99e","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x5a03841c2e2f5811f9e548cf98e88e878e55d99e"}},"is_native":false}
