{"name":"Etheria Token","id":"etheria-token_ethereum","symbol":"etrx","description":"Etheria is a blockchain-powered digital mythos built on Ethereum, centered around seven interconnected Realms and a community-driven narrative. Its official utility token, $ETRX, underpins the ecosystem by enabling access to limited Realms and Artifacts, participation in governance, allowlist access for NFT and in-world drops, and contribution to community rewards. The project combines token utility, decentralized governance, and NFT-driven lore expansion into a cohesive ecosystem. The presale of $ETRX is structured in phased tiers, with transparent pricing and supply (10,000,000 total tokens), leading into a Token Generation Event (TGE), distribution to presale participants, and seeding of initial liquidity pools. Beyond financial utility, Etheria integrates a narrative progression where each Realm corresponds to a stage of development: Gateway to Etheria (entry/presale), Crystal Cathedral (foundations), Shattered Skies (volatility), Obsidian Spire (governance), Forgotten Garden (community), Luminous Cavern (liquidity), and the Sanctum of the Drowned Kings (long-term stability). $ETRX holders play an active role in this unfolding framework by voting, unlocking access, and shaping the community’s trajectory.","links":"https://enteretheria.io/","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/etheria-token_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa3c48ef518cab21e5772392d5405de5d73b35190","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xa3c48ef518cab21e5772392d5405de5d73b35190"}},"is_native":false}
