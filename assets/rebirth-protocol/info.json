{"name":"Rebirth Protocol","id":"rebirth-protocol","symbol":"rbh","description":"A primary objective of $RBH is to restrict both farming activities and fraudulent schemes that plague the daily landscape of the cryptocurrency realm. This initiative seeks to transform symbolically stolen funds into a resource that can be repurposed to establish fresh opportunities and platforms within the cryptocurrency sphere. We receive tokens from dead memecoins that investors perceive as having little value or no potential for revival. Our Memecoin Incubator then tracks the amount of tokens and value of each meme coin sent to the Rebirth wallet. Memecoins that receive the highest USD value will be relaunched in $RBH live pairs. The LP will be funded by the 60% supply we have kept since launch and will be locked forever. The raised ETH will be used to buyback native tokens of $RBH, fund marketing initiatives for the native token and provide staking rewards $RBH have a 5/5 tax aimed at fostering continuous development and effective marketing to ensure the project's growth and success.","links":"https://rebirthprotocol.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/rebirth-protocol/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x7a29fb472f0e62bce6127f125e8d5ad2a9fa3839"}}}
