{"name":"Rake.in","id":"rake-in","symbol":"rake","description":"Rakein protocol is the first lending protocol that enables users to lend and borrow a diverse range of cryptocurrencies and NFT using variable interest rates on the blockchain of Chromia. In addition to the typical features seen on other protocols like Aave, Rakein includes notable distinguishing features such as Multiple pools and NFT collateral. What is more, there is no gas fee for our end users. Rakein leverages a native token – RAKE – that provides holders with governance. RAKE can also be staked for insurance to earn protocol fees and RAKE rewards when DAO is introduced.","links":"https://www.rakein.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/rake-in/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0x4c8a3a1025ab87ef184cb7f0691a5a371fe783a6"}}}
