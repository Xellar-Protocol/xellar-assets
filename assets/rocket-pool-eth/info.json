Rocket Pool ETH (rETH) is the Rocket Pool protocol's liquid staking token. The rETH token represents an amount of ETH that is being staked and earning rewards within Ethereum Proof-of-Stake. As Rocket Pool node operators, stake Ethereum on Proof-of-Stake the resulting rewards increase the value of rETH relative to ETH. Rocket Pool's liquid staking token allows holders to benefit from the returns of the Ethereum Proof-of-Stake.
