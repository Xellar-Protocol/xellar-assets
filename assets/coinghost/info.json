Instead, existing socalled blockchain portals have many lowquality contents such as advertisements, fake news, in flammatory writings, and unverified facts. In addition, these days it is difficult to find a space where users vol untarily share professional information related to blockchain and digital assets. And it can be said that this kind of phenomenon is caused that because there is no adequate compensation system and feedback acâ€” cording to the contribution level such as information production and distribution Coinghost aims to be a more specialized blockchain portal by supplementing the problems of other blockchain platforms. Google, Naver, and Daum have grown into mega portal sites by providing a variety of services that users need, such as news, information search, and shopping, games and so many more. Coinghost also intends to grow into the largest portal in the blockchain industry with expertise by providing services that anyone may need and is interested in, such as news, user participation space, shopping, UGC and games.

Users can use tokens for various purposes, including Cogo Bank, a staking service with high interest rates, and VOD payment for COGO TV, a streaming service specializ- ing in crypto content.","links":"https://coinghost.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/coinghost/logo.png"}
