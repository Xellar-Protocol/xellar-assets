{"name":"BollyCoin","id":"bollycoin","symbol":"bolly","description":"BollyCoin was created to bring a large portion of all existing iconic Bollywood media onto the blockchain and allow community interests in such media through tokens. Weâ€™re directly partnering with the owners [production houses and licensors] of original Bollywood media, adding them to the blockchain and turning them into NFTs. These NFTs would be subsequently sold on our platform. For example, an NFT of a scene from an iconic movie that millions of people love.","links":"https://www.bollycoin.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bollycoin/logo.png"}
