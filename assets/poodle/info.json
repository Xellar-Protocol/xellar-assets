{"name":"Poodl","id":"poodle","symbol":"poodl","description":"POODL is a BEP-20 deflationary, self-LP generating token that is powered by the work and idea of its community. 1% of every transaction is burned forever, 1% is redistributed to holders, and 1% will be permanently added to the locked LP. This increases the scarcity of the supply of POODL tokens and increases its stability, which means that each POODL holder has a strong incentive to hold and spread the use of POODL.","links":"https://www.poodltoken.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/poodle/logo.png"}
