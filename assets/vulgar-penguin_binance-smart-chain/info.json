{"name":"三维威廉泰尔企鹅 (Vulgar Penguin)","id":"vulgar-penguin_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"恶俗企鹅","description":"The \"Vulgar Penguin\" is a groundbreaking Binance Smart Chain (BSC) meme coin that captures the irreverent spirit of internet culture through the re-creation of a beloved emoji: the cheeky penguin. Launched as a community-driven token, Vulgar Penguin transforms a simple digital icon into a powerful symbol of humor, rebellion, and generational identity. What started as a whimsical emoji has exploded into a viral sensation, disseminated across social media platforms, messaging apps, and online forums. Its rapid rise to fame underscores the power of memes in the crypto space, where fun meets finance in an accessible, engaging way. At the heart of Vulgar Penguin lies its prototype: the three-dimensional William Tell Penguin. This isn't just any penguin—it's a nod to the legendary Swiss folk hero William Tell, reimagined in a plump, arrow-defying avian form. The original William Tell Penguin gained cult status in early internet circles as a 3D-rendered mascot symbolizing precision, defiance, and playful absurdity. Vulgar Penguin elevates this archetype by infusing it with modern meme energy. The coin's logo and branding feature a stylized, vulgar-twist version of the penguin—complete with exaggerated expressions, sassy poses, and edgy accessories—that resonates with users tired of polished corporate tokens. On Binance Smart Chain, Vulgar Penguin offers low-cost transactions, fast confirmations, and seamless integration with decentralized exchanges like PancakeSwap, making it ideal for meme enthusiasts and casual traders alike. Vulgar Penguin has become more than a token; it's a spiritual symbol for the Internet Z generation. Born between the late 1990s and early 2010s, Gen Z navigates a world of digital overload, economic uncertainty, and social media saturation. The Vulgar Penguin embodies their ethos: unapologetic vulgarity as a form of empowerment, humor as a coping mechanism, and community as a lifeline. In an era where traditional finance feels exclusionary, this meme coin democratizes crypto participation. Holders aren't just investors—they're part of a vibrant ecosystem where memes drive value. The project's viral dissemination began on platforms like Twitter (now X), TikTok, Reddit, and Discord, where users shared customized penguin emojis, fan art, and hilarious skits. This organic spread turned Vulgar Penguin into a cultural phenomenon, with millions of impressions and a dedicated following. The tokenomics are designed for sustainability and fun. With a total supply capped at 1 billion tokens, Vulgar Penguin incorporates deflationary mechanics: a portion of every transaction is burned, reducing supply over time and potentially increasing scarcity. Additional fees fund liquidity pools and marketing initiatives, ensuring long-term growth. Community governance allows holders to vote on developments, from NFT drops featuring vulgar penguin variants to partnerships with influencers. Security is paramount; the smart contract has been audited by reputable firms, and liquidity is locked to prevent rugs. What sets Vulgar Penguin apart in the crowded meme coin landscape is its authenticity. Unlike fleeting pumps, it builds on a pre-existing emoji with real-world usage—think of it in group chats, reaction images, or profile pictures. This foundation gives it staying power. The Z generation sees themselves in the penguin: bold, irreverent, and ready to flip the bird at norms. As crypto evolves, Vulgar Penguin leads the charge in meme-fi, blending entertainment with utility. Future roadmap includes a play-to-earn game where players control vulgar penguins in absurd adventures, merchandise lines, and cross-chain expansions. Vulgar Penguin isn't just a coin—it's a movement. Embrace the vulgarity, ride the wave, and become part of internet history. With its Binance base, explosive community, and symbolic depth, Vulgar Penguin is poised to waddle into the mainstream","links":"https://vulgarpenguin.com/","market_cap":7150378,"market_cap_rank":1807,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/vulgar-penguin_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe1e93e92c0c2aff2dc4d7d4a8b250d973cad4444","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xe1e93e92c0c2aff2dc4d7d4a8b250d973cad4444"}},"is_native":false}
