{"name":"Small Thing","id":"small-thing_base","symbol":"st","description":"Small Thing develops intelligent marine robots capable of autonomous navigation, detection, and microplastic collection. Each robot is part of a self-learning swarm, sharing mission data through an encrypted AI mesh network. Designed for real-world conditions — salt, pressure, waves — they operate without pilots, adapting their behavior through onboard edge AI. All collected data is aggregated into a real-time ocean intelligence platform, bridging robotics, data science, and environmental restoration.","links":"https://small-thing.com/","market_cap":1279137,"market_cap_rank":3451,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/small-thing_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x214419f6fdd2b23bf6a32f33cf95186d188b784b","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x214419f6fdd2b23bf6a32f33cf95186d188b784b"}},"is_native":false}
