{"name":"Analog","id":"analog_base","symbol":"anlog","description":"Analog is an omnichain protocol that employs Nominal Proof-of-Stake (NPoS) to connect blockchain ecosystems, enabling seamless cross-chain applications. Instead of centralized bridges, it uses the Timechain—a decentralized consensus layer—to validate operations via Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS). This enhances security, consolidates liquidity, and powers innovative dApps across multiple networks.","links":"https://www.analog.one/","market_cap":770207,"market_cap_rank":4049,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/analog/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":12,"contract_address":"0x5305ba038217c391af7e79f6f653c8cbc433deba","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x5305ba038217c391af7e79f6f653c8cbc433deba"}},"is_native":false}
