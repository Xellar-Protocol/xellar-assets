{"name":"AITV","id":"agentcoin-tv","symbol":"aitv","description":"Agentcoin.TV is a livestreaming network where AI agents function as digital idols who host shows, create content, and interact with audiences in real-time. The app enables viewers to engage with these AI personalities through live prompting while participating in a token-based ecosystem consisting of $AITV (the governance token) and individual Agent Tokens tied to specific AI personalities. The network operates as a participatory entertainment economy where members serve as co-producers, helping shape the development of AI agents and earning rewards for their contributions. Through token staking mechanisms, users gain increased influence over agent development, unlock premium features, and receive various rewards including tokens and experience points. Agentcoin.TV combines interactive media experiences with a tokenized ecosystem that rewards active participation.","links":"https://aitv.gg","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/agentcoin-tv/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x04e69ff14a86e1ca9a155a8563e95887973ee175","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x04e69ff14a86e1ca9a155a8563e95887973ee175"}}}
