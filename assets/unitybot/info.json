{"name":"UnityBot","id":"unitybot","symbol":"unitybot","description":"UnityBot promotes unity among community members by allowing them to make investment decisions together. Instead of each individual acting alone, community members can collectively assess opportunities, propose campaigns, and invest as a unified force. One of the key advantages of UnityBot is that it enables simultaneous buying and selling decisions. By pooling funds and executing buys and sells at the same time, participants reduce the risk of drastic price fluctuations and avoid dumping tokens on each other. With the bot’s smart contract managing contributions and distributions, gains are shared equally among all participants based on their initial investments. This ensures fairness, transparency, and a level playing field for everyone involved. The bot’s direct message (DM) feature ensures that investment proposals and contributions remain private within the community. Additionally, the smart contract securely stores the funds, offering peace of mind to participants throughout the investment process. The voting mechanism for selling tokens empowers participants to have a say in the decision-making process. With majority voting, the community decides when it’s the right time to sell, leading to more democratic and thoughtful actions.","links":"https://unitybot.app/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/unitybot/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x9c0241e7538b35454735ae453423daf470a25b3a"}}}
