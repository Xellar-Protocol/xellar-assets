{"name":"Yield Generating Enreach","id":"yield-generating-enreach","symbol":"ygnrch","description":"1.) ygNRCH is ERC 4626 token that represents $NRCH staked position on our yaggr.app. (similar to ETH and stETH). When user stakes NRCH on yaggr.app, it receives ygNRCH. All yields generated through transactional taxes and other sources of yield are distributed to ygNRCH pool. 2.) ygNRCH holders earn stable return based on NRCH transactional tax (currently active) and penalty tax and Yaggr management fees (to be activated in the future). 3.) ygNRCH is the first yield generating vault on yaggr.app, representing staked NRCH position. 4.) The next steps for ygNRCH are activation of other sources of yield (penalty taxes and management fees) and increasing of total APY on this strategy. 5.) ygNRCH can be traded, provided as liquidity or unstaked (claiming back NRCH).","links":"https://enreach.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/yield-generating-enreach/logo.png"}
