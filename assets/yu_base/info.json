{"name":"Yala Stablecoin","id":"yu_base","symbol":"yu","description":"$YU is part of Yala, a native Bitcoin liquidity protocol that channels BTC into yield opportunities across DeFi and RWAs. Bitcoin holders unlock capital through self-custodial, liquidation-free borrowing by minting $YU, a BTC-backed liquidity asset (stablecoin). In this process, they pay a stability fee directly to $YU depositors, effectively exchanging BTC-backed exposure for portable, capital-efficient liquidity and access to yield without giving up ownership. Yala’s SmartVault module manages system risk and ensures efficient yield distribution.","links":"https://yala.org/","market_cap":25834433,"market_cap_rank":957,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/yu_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe868084cf08f3c3db11f4b73a95473762d9463f7","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xe868084cf08f3c3db11f4b73a95473762d9463f7"}},"is_native":false}
