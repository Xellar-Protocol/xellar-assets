{"name":"Scarface Finance","id":"scarface-finance","symbol":"scar","description":"The $SCAR algorithmic token serves as the backbone of a rapidly growing ecosystem aimed towards bringing liquidity and new use cases to the Opera network. The protocol's underlying mechanism dynamically adjusts $SCAR's supply, pushing its price up or down relative to the price of $FTM. Inspired by the original idea behind Basis as well as its predecessors (bDollar and soup), Scarface.Finance is a multi-token protocol which consists of the following three tokens: -SCAR ($SCAR). -SCAR Shares ($SSHARE) -SCAR Bonds ($SBOND). One of the primary shortcomings of past algorithmic tokens has been a lack of use cases, leaving no good reason for somebody to want to use or hold them. In order to successfully maintain the peg in the long-run, the SCAR team will maintain a focus on innovation around enhanced functionality and use cases.","links":"https://scarface.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/scarface-finance/logo.png"}
