{"name":"AVIAH","id":"aviah_solana","symbol":"aviah","description":"AVIAH is a Solana‑based utility token that powers AVIAH.ai, a platform for building, owning and monetising photorealistic, emotionally‑aware virtual humans. Developers upload a single image, multi‑view photos, short video or just a text prompt; AVIAH’s authoring tools then generate a fully voiced, large‑language‑model (LLM)‑driven avatar that can be embedded in web, mobile or Unity3D apps. The token underpins the whole value‑loop: you lock AVIAH to mint an avatar NFT (proof‑of‑ownership), pay per API call when the avatar speaks, stake for lower fees or higher governance weight, and receive automated revenue shares when your character is used. Because everything — from usage metering to revenue distribution — runs on‑chain, creators, developers and investors all have transparent, enforceable rights and incentives, eliminating “black‑box” revenue splits that plague today’s AI avatar services.","links":"http://www.aviah.ai","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/aviah_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"HdYskPuX5cBApzGqFtoyKdzLxfsLCQxucQfmX2FiquWo","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/HdYskPuX5cBApzGqFtoyKdzLxfsLCQxucQfmX2FiquWo"}},"is_native":false}
