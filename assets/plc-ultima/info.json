Both are characterized by network stability, transparency and high transaction processing speed with the option of using the Segregated Witness protocol upgrade. The developers of PLC Ultima have expanded the functionality of the Litecoin blockchain and increased the scope of its application. The PLC Ultima blockchain uses the CryptoNight hashing algorithm used by Bytecoin and Monero. We have introduced a more equitable distribution of rewards among participants using minting, backed by smart contracts. Additionally, this solution has been tested for vulnerability to all types of attacks, including network separation, hacking attempts, blockchain tampering, keyspace attack, etc.","links":"https://plcultima.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/plc-ultima/logo.png"}
