{"name":"BELEAF","id":"beleaf_solana","symbol":"leaf","description":"BELEAF is an RWA platform on Solana that tokenizes high-value raw materials, starting with agarwood. Each RWA NFT maps 1:1 to a verified physical unit (tree/lot) with on-chain provenance and lifecycle data. The $LEAF utility token powers minting, fees, mini-games, staking, and other platform actions. When users mint RWA NFTs, the $LEAF spent is routed to a treasury sink wallet (removed from active circulation), aligning real usage with a contracting effective supply; a public deflation dashboard displays sinks/flows and NFT activity. Holders can monetize via marketplace sale (to BELEAF or third-party offtakers), stablecoin settlement with partner buyers (e.g., USDT/USDC), or—where available—physical delivery. Beyond minting, $LEAF has clear utilities: • Staking & tiers: priority access/WL boosts, fee rebates, and loyalty perks tied to staked amounts. • Mini-games & quests: on-chain activities that may use small $LEAF entries and award sponsored rewards—driving engagement and additional sinks. • Marketplace utilities: listing/settlement fees, WL raffles, and referral programs settled in $LEAF. • NFT lifecycle actions: renewals/upgrades/service fees payable in $LEAF (sent to the sink). • Governance (progressive): community input on parameters such as sink rates, fee bands, and sourcing schedules. Together, asset-backed NFTs, a visible supply-sink, and practical utilities aim to ground token value in real inventory and measurable activity, not hype.","links":"https://www.beleaf.ai","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/beleaf/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"GT9SetU8UWKJeCQsmMcNHH4pGPVSKrxgQsgu2wtYmZHW","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/GT9SetU8UWKJeCQsmMcNHH4pGPVSKrxgQsgu2wtYmZHW"}},"is_native":false}
