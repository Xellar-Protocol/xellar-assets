{"name":"Ampleforth","id":"ampleforth","symbol":"ampl","description":"Ampleforth is a digital-asset-protocol for smart commodity-money. The smart commodity money with a unique elastic supply protocol. AMPL supply expands and contracts in response to it’s price deviating from a 1 USD target. Deviations result in a supply change of AMPLs once every 24 hours, increasing or decreasing the number of tokens in each holder’s wallet pro-rata. Ampleforth is the only asset in the world with this elastic supply property, and therefore has counter-cyclical trading pressure and is uncorrelated with other digital assets such as Bitcoin.","links":"https://www.ampleforth.org/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ampleforth/logo.png"}
