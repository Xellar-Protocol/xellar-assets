{"name":"Ampleforth","id":"ampleforth","symbol":"ampl","description":"Ampleforth is a digital-asset-protocol for smart commodity-money. The smart commodity money with a unique elastic supply protocol. AMPL supply expands and contracts in response to it’s price deviating from a 1 USD target. Deviations result in a supply change of AMPLs once every 24 hours, increasing or decreasing the number of tokens in each holder’s wallet pro-rata. Ampleforth is the only asset in the world with this elastic supply property, and therefore has counter-cyclical trading pressure and is uncorrelated with other digital assets such as Bitcoin.","links":"https://www.ampleforth.org/","market_cap":254742762,"market_cap_rank":358,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ampleforth/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xd46ba6d942050d489dbd938a2c909a5d5039a161"},"near-protocol":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"77fba179c79de5b7653f68b5039af940ada60ce0.factory.bridge.near"},"harmony-shard-0":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xf2f5bf00cd952f3f980a02f5dce278cbff4dae05"},"avalanche":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x027dbca046ca156de9622cd1e2d907d375e53aa7"},"energi":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x79786ed8a70ccec6c7a31debc7fefc5119f9dc95"},"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xdb021b1b247fe2f1fa57e0a87c748cc1e321f07f"}}}
