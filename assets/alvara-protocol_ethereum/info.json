{"name":"Alvara Protocol","id":"alvara-protocol_ethereum","symbol":"alva","description":"Alvara Protocol has created the ERC-7621 (Basket Token Standard) and the BSKT factory, which enables anyone to create their own tokenized multi-asset fund and become a fund manager. All created BSKT funds are displayed on a fully public leaderboard where other investors can track all performance metrics and choose to contribute to the fund. The more other investors contribute to the fund, the more management fees the fund manager makes. The fund manager holds the rights to create proposals for changes around the fund and other investors can use their BSKT LP tokens to vote on these proposals, creating a true meritocratic democracy within fund management.","links":"https://alvara.xyz/","market_cap":2674751,"market_cap_rank":2656,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/alvara-protocol/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8e729198d1c59b82bd6bba579310c40d740a11c2","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x8e729198d1c59b82bd6bba579310c40d740a11c2"}},"is_native":false}
