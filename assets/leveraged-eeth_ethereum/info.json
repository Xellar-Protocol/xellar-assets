{"name":"Leveraged eETH","id":"leveraged-eeth_ethereum","symbol":"xeeth","description":"The xeETH token, also called leveraged eETH, is a decentralized, composable leveraged long eETH futures contract with a low risk of liquidations and 0 funding fee (and in extreme cases, xETH minters can earn fees). It’s a token to amplify your gains on a long-term bet on ETH price growth. rUSD is a stablecoin that uses the same mechanism as fxUSD, but with its reserve comprised of only ETH Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRT), starting with Ether.fi’s eETH. Hence, xeETH was born.","links":"https://fx.aladdin.club/earn/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/leveraged-eeth_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xacb3604aadf26e6c0bb8c720420380629a328d2c","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xacb3604aadf26e6c0bb8c720420380629a328d2c"}},"is_native":false}
