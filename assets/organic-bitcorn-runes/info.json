{"name":"ORGANIC•BITCORN (Runes)","id":"organic-bitcorn-runes","symbol":"corn","description":"ORGANIC•BITCORN is a rune that was etched and minted on top of Bitcoin via the Runes Protocol. Bitcoin Runes are fungible tokens that are created on the Bitcoin blockchain and are exchangeable, similar to other cryptocurrencies. They enable simple tokenization on the stable and secure Bitcoin infrastructure. They are based on Bitcoin's UTXO model and are created through a process called etching, where the token data is embedded in transactions. They are efficient in the storage and use of resources as they take up little storage space on the blockchain.","links":"","market_cap":2964739,"market_cap_rank":2863,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/organic-bitcorn-runes/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ordinals":{"decimal_place":0,"contract_address":"872119:457"},"solana":{"decimal_place":2,"contract_address":"7PKN3kto5SgM52GD8dRHVSVZKArL4vQvuuSTQgnqoScH"}}}
