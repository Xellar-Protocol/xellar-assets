{"name":"G920","id":"g920_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"g920","description":"G920 — The Silent Code G920 — 沉默的密码 Prologue There is a pattern hidden in silence. Not everyone can see it. Those who do, never remain the same. G920 has already begun. 在沉默之中隐藏着一种规律。 不是每个人都能看见。 而那些看见的人，将不再相同。 G920 已经开始。 I. Introduction Some things are not explained. They are felt. G920 is one of them. It came from nowhere, belongs to nothing, but it carries a secret. 有些事物无法解释，只能感受。G920 就是其中之一。 它无处而来，不属于任何地方，却携带着一个秘密。 II. The Language of Silence G920 does not speak in words. It speaks in unseen order. Those who perceive the pattern may find meaning, and within that meaning — a reward. G920 不用语言交流。它以不可见的秩序说话。 能察觉其规律的人，或许会找到意义，而在意义之中——藏着奖励。 III. The Unspoken Game This is not a race. It is a test of perception. The alphabet exists, but not everyone can read it. Somewhere, within the silence, lies a prize. 这不是一场竞赛，而是一场感知的考验。 字母存在，但不是所有人都能读懂。 在沉默之中，某处隐藏着奖赏。 IV. Behind the Visible Every line hides something. Every pause is a clue. Some will see letters, others will see keys. The difference lies in what you notice. 每一行都隐藏着某种东西。 每一个停顿都是线索。 有人看到的是文字，有人看到的是钥匙。 区别在于你注意到了什么。 V. Warning This text was not written to be solved. Yet, someone will solve it. When that happens, the secret will no longer be a secret. 这段文字并非为被解开而写。 然而，总会有人解开它。 当那一刻到来，秘密将不再是秘密。 VI. The Silent Agreement Those who touch G920 become part of an unseen agreement. “Seek the knowledge, and you may find yourself.” 触碰 G920 的人，会成为无形契约的一部分。 “寻找知识，你也许会找到自己。” VII. Final Line At the end, there is only one sentence. It changes everything. But to find it, one must understand the silence first. 在结尾，只有一句话。 它改变一切。 但要找到它，必须先理解沉默。 VIII. G920 “Words deceive. Silence reveals.” “言语会欺骗，沉默会揭示。","links":"https://g920.org/","market_cap":3723.85,"market_cap_rank":12741,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/g920_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x73f40fd9a523f275073ae921a07c2bb125334444","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x73f40fd9a523f275073ae921a07c2bb125334444"}},"is_native":false}
