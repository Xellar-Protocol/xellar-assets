{"name":"USDO","id":"usdo","symbol":"usdo","description":"What is USDO? USDO is a special coin on ONUS Chain that is backed by collateralized stablecoins carefully audited by proven auditing companies. The collateral comes from: - Part of the fees from transactions on MiaSwap will be converted to a stablecoin and deposited into the collateral to back USDO. This deposit does not put new USDO in circulation. - Users deposit collateral at the market rate in order to mint new USDO. What makes USDO different from other stablecoins out there? - USDO is not pegged but backed by collateralized stablecoins that have been selected and audited by proven auditing companies. - With a unique mechanism, USDO's price can't go lower than its collateralized stablecoins - Everyone can mint and redeem USDO at any time. - USDO holds value down to the last holder even when everyone sells out. - The value of USDO can increase faster after a massive dump.","links":"https://usdo.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/usdo/logo.png"}
