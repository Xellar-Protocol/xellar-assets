{"name":"Hulk Inu","id":"hulk-inu","symbol":"hulk","description":"HULK INU is already set to become the strongest of the INU tokens. Firstly, the token features include anti-bot technology, this has allowed for the marketing budget to grow astronomically. Secondly, anti-whale measures are implemented to decrease the opportunity for investors to manipulate or dominate the chart. Finally, automated buybacks are enabled to promote stability within a volatile market. $HULK provides investors with low taxes to be able to maximize their profits while simultaneously increasing the project's volume to spark the interest of new investors. $HULK tokenomics redistribute these low taxes back into the liquidity pool, the buy back wallet, and the marketing funds. To conclude, HULK INU has already launched our Dapp, providing investors with an additional source of passive income.","links":"http://hulk-inu.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/hulk-inu/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x91a5de30e57831529a3c1af636a78a7e4e83f3aa"}}}
