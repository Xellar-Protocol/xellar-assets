{"name":"Olympus","id":"olympus_base","symbol":"ohm","description":"Olympus is a decentralized financial (DeFi) protocol building programmable monetary infrastructure. At its core is OHM, a treasury-backed token held and managed on-chain. The protocol is built for solvency, self-sustaining liquidity, and policy-driven equilibrium. This guides how value, liquidity, and credit are managed, through on-chain mechanisms including Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL), Cooler Loans, Convertible Deposits (CDs), the Yield Repurchase Facility (YRF), and Range Bound Stability (RBS). Together, these components form a programmable central bank, without human bias.","links":"https://olympusdao.finance/","market_cap":360305810,"market_cap_rank":186,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/olympus_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x060cb087a9730e13aa191f31a6d86bff8dfcdcc0","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x060cb087a9730e13aa191f31a6d86bff8dfcdcc0"}},"is_native":false}
