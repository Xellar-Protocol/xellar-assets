{"name":"589","id":"589-token","symbol":"589","description":"The project at 589onxrpl.com centers around the $589 token, a community-driven cryptocurrency on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). This token draws inspiration from a notable prediction within the XRP community that XRP's value would reach $589, symbolizing optimism and ambition in the crypto space. Following initial mismanagement by its original developers, the community initiated a Community Takeover (CTO) to revitalize and steer the project transparently. Now, decisions are collectively made by token holders, emphasizing the strength of a united community. The project boasts significant trading volumes on platforms like First Ledger and a growing base of holders, aiming to transform the meme into a meaningful movement","links":"https://www.589onxrpl.com/","market_cap":816591,"market_cap_rank":3888,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/589-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"xrp":{"decimal_place":0,"contract_address":"589.rfcasq9uRbvwcmLFvc4ti3j8Qt1CYCGgHz","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/xrpl/tokens/589.rfcasq9uRbvwcmLFvc4ti3j8Qt1CYCGgHz"}}}
