{"name":"Colombian Peso","id":"colombian-peso_ethereum","symbol":"wcop","description":"wCOP is a fully collateralized stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the Colombian peso (COP). Issued and governed by a Ripio subsidiary, it brings COP on-chain so Colombians and global users can transact, save, and build on decentralized networks in their local currency. Backed by Ripio’s since-2013 track record in LATAM, wCOP enables faster, cheaper COP transfers, FX and remittance flows, DeFi trading and lending, and seamless on/off-ramps and payments without leaving the COP unit of account.","links":"https://www.ripio.com/es/criptos/stablecoins-locales","market_cap":25761,"market_cap_rank":9289,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/colombian-peso_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8a1d45e102e886510e891d2ec656a708991e2d76"}},"is_native":false}
