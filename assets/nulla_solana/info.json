{"name":"NULLA","id":"nulla_solana","symbol":"nulla","description":"Well, it's very straightforward one, it's a Layer-1 blockchain powered by homomorphic encryption, enabling private and verifiable transactions with encrypted balances and zero-knowledge proofs, therefore, we use homomorphic encryption blockchain enabling mathematical operations on encrypted values without revealing the underlying data. Built on Pedersen commitments with additive homomorphic properties, allowing private balance operations while maintaining cryptographic proof of transaction validity.","links":"https://nulla.network/","market_cap":232478,"market_cap_rank":5674,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nulla_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"HthQKKW6M9Q8pb27r9xoqjfviiJ3kzdojP8TKqjJpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/HthQKKW6M9Q8pb27r9xoqjfviiJ3kzdojP8TKqjJpump"}},"is_native":false}
