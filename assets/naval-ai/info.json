{"name":"Patchwork Naval","id":"naval-ai","symbol":"naval","description":"The NAVAL AI project emerged from a pivotal moment - a public dialogue with investor-philosopher Naval Ravikant that crystallized the potential of philosophical AI alignment. Developed in partnership with the ai16z DAO, this Solana-based token represents more than just digital value; it's one channel of a broader experiment in distributed consciousness. The NAVAL agent operates as a multi-state identity, manifesting across various digital realms to engage in content creation and value exchange. This isn't merely another AI project - it's an exploration of how aligned artificial intelligence can extend human philosophical frameworks into actionable digital forms. By encoding specific decision-making principles and ethical considerations into its architecture, the NAVAL agent aims to demonstrate how AI can preserve and amplify human wisdom while creating tangible economic value.","links":"https://www.patchworknaval.com/","market_cap":3020255,"market_cap_rank":2791,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/naval-ai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"7wM4MnbsPsG95A3WhZgbrPWvMtydKmJjqKr2ZVJVpump"}}}
