{"name":"Mithrilverse","id":"mithrilverse","symbol":"mithril","description":"MITHRIL is a deflationary token on the Binance Smart Chain, fueled by memetic energy and an active community of MITHRIL-handed holders. The MITHRIL token yields reflections generated from a 4% tax on all transactions; 2% is sent to liquidity and 2% is distributed to holders. Anti-whale mechanics prevent individual wallets from accumulating >1% of supply, thus minimizing price volatility and maximizing coin distribution. MITHRIL strives to empower content creators and dApp developers with the opportunity to build their own worlds within the Mithrilverse, our decentralized metaverse project.","links":"https://www.bscmithril.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mithrilverse/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x566fdf5bf13b9642cbdfdd1e5f2a67dc2bc1755a"}}}
