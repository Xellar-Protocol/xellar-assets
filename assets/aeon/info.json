{"name":"Aeon","id":"aeon","symbol":"aeon","description":"Aeon is a mobile-friendly, lightweight privacy coin. Similar to the way that <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/litecoin\">Litecoin</a> is a lighter supplement to <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a>, you can look at Aeon as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/monero\">Monero’s</a> little brother. The Monero community is wholly focused on privacy and anonymity for the end-user. This focus has its perks but has caused the coin to fall behind from a usability standpoint. Aeon builds upon Monero’s CryptoNote hash while adding some lightweight functionality of its own. Aeon is the lighter, faster version of Monero. Although both projects share the same underlying privacy protocol, CryptoNote, Aeon is striving to be more accessible. The project is doing so by implementing a lightweight mining algorithm, smaller blockchain, and optional anonymity. As Monero grows, Aeon could very well grow with it. While you would use Monero for transactions in which you want to assure privacy, you may find Aeon to be a suitable substitute for day-to-day exchanges in which guaranteed anonymity isn’t as important.","links":"http://www.aeon.cash/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/aeon/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
