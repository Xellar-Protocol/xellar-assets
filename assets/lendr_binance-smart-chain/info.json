{"name":"Lendr","id":"lendr_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"rwal","description":"Lendr is building a next-generation protocol that bridges real-world assets (RWA) with on-chain liquidity. By tokenizing assets such as real estate, credit, and yield-bearing instruments, Lendr aims to make them tradable, liquid, and globally accessible. At the center of the ecosystem is $RWAL, the governance and utility token: Governance & DAO: RWAL stakers have voting power over key protocol decisions — from which RWAs to onboard, to fee structures, upgrades, and treasury management. Staking & Incentives: Users can stake RWAL to secure the protocol and earn rewards, while also backing liquidity pools that connect DeFi capital with real-world yields. Utility: RWAL is used for participation in liquidity programs, unlocking premium features, and aligning incentives between the protocol, investors, and asset originators. Lendr’s vision is to unlock trillions in untapped value by combining DeFi’s efficiency with the stability of real-world collateral. This positions RWAL as a cornerstone of the growing RWA sector, bringing sustainable yield, transparency, and decentralized governance into one platform.","links":"https://lendr.fi/","market_cap":1770366,"market_cap_rank":3100,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/lendr/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x4a61e3217d48b6361b87f598256a8ef71ac913f7","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x4a61e3217d48b6361b87f598256a8ef71ac913f7"}},"is_native":false}
