{"name":"DearBook","id":"dearbook","symbol":"dearbook","description":"DearBook is the first AI-Powered Children's Book Generator. In today’s fast-paced, digital-first world, children grow up surrounded by technology and innovation, but the process of creating stories has often been limited by tools, skills, or access. Books remain timeless, yet the act of storytelling should evolve. Through DearBook, we aim to democratize the creation of books, ensuring that no child is left out of the joy of seeing their creativity realized in tangible form. This platform isn’t just about generating books; it’s about: Inspiring creativity by helping children dream bigger and express themselves. Fostering curiosity through interactive prompts and AI-generated illustrations that introduce children to language, art, and storytelling. Building confidence as children see their ideas and emotions transformed into a finished work of art—something they can hold, share, and be proud of.","links":"https://dearbook.fun/","market_cap":329447,"market_cap_rank":4961,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dearbook/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"zPf8M7V2YznAvLzsnauyBb3gefYpYbrMotzifXJpump"}}}
