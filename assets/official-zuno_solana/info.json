{"name":"OFFICIAL ZUNO","id":"official-zuno_solana","symbol":"zuno","description":"ZUNO is a community-driven meme token on the Solana blockchain. It is designed to represent fun, social engagement, and collective identity rather than complex or speculative financial products. Community members may choose to participate in staking programs where rewards are distributed transparently on-chain. There are no guaranteed utilities or returns, and the future direction of the token is determined by community involvement. ZUNO emphasizes user self-custody, open communication, and verifiable token transparency through public Solana explorers.","links":"https://zuno.guru","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/official-zuno_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"G1VhWSAhYXRRzokGqxs4aQ8u5DSuP69ki2bN7hnapjzZ","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/G1VhWSAhYXRRzokGqxs4aQ8u5DSuP69ki2bN7hnapjzZ"}},"is_native":false}
