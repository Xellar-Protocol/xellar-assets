{"name":"Threshold Network","id":"threshold-network-token_optimistic-ethereum","symbol":"t","description":"Threshold is a project merged from the NuCypher and Keep networks, which strives to provide different threshold cryptography solutions in a fully decentralized manner to the web3 community. Threshold cryptography is a technology that uses cryptography to unlock greater utility and usability for digital assets without needing to trust a centralized party. Threshold cryptography distributes sensitive operations across multiple independent entities – like nodes in a network – and requires a threshold, or minimum number of those entities to cooperate for the operation to be successful.","links":"https://threshold.network/","market_cap":102567705,"market_cap_rank":410,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/threshold-network-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"optimistic-ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x747e42eb0591547a0ab429b3627816208c734ea7","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/optimism/tokens/0x747e42eb0591547a0ab429b3627816208c734ea7"}},"is_native":false}
