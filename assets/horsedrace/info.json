{"name":"HorseDrace","id":"horsedrace","symbol":"horsedrace","description":"HorseDrace is a play-to-earn PVP style horse racing game where players compete for top placement against 5 other racers. Each race has randomised races variables which include accelaration, speed, stamina. Using strategic upgrades and foods, players must place in the top 1 to earn the platforms utility token, $HORSEDRACE. Within the game, players are able to fusion, rent, sell, and of course race their Horses to earn $HORSEDRACE tokens. This system has proven to be a sound long-term economic approach when building an NFT/Blockchain based game as it enables teams to build large guilds, scholarship programs, and even provides solo players the opportunity to earn in game tokens through daily racing.","links":"https://www.HorseDrace.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/horsedrace/logo.png"}
