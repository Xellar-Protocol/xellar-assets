{"name":"TaxSplit","id":"taxsplit_solana","symbol":"tax","description":"TaxSplit is a no-code token launchpad built on Solana that enables anyone to create tokens with built-in automatic tax distribution mechanisms. The platform addresses the complexity of traditional token creation by eliminating the need for smart contract programming while providing sophisticated tokenomics features. When users buy or sell tokens created on TaxSplit, a customizable transaction tax (typically 1-10%) is automatically collected and distributed to multiple parties: token holders who receive rewards proportional to their holdings, developers for funding ongoing operations, and optional burn mechanisms that create deflationary pressure. The native $TAX token powers the ecosystem with a 10% transaction tax split between holder rewards (distributed every 15 minutes), platform development, marketing initiatives, and automatic burns. Additionally, 10% of all platform fees are used to buy back and burn $TAX tokens from the open market, creating continuous buying pressure and reducing total supply.","links":"https://taxsplit.app","market_cap":24631,"market_cap_rank":9384,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/taxsplit_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"TaxhxvQdW5WwxDtxmyDnXfJ9eJV7wacbgow2kDEpogX","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/TaxhxvQdW5WwxDtxmyDnXfJ9eJV7wacbgow2kDEpogX"}},"is_native":false}
