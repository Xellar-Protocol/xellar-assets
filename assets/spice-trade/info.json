{"name":"Spice Trade","id":"spice-trade","symbol":"spice","description":"The core thesis of the Spice Trade protocol is that there is a massive need for a decentralized, on-chain, open-source, value-stable, scalable, modular, cross-chain, and capital-efficient system for global trade. Such a system should have deep, long-term, and protocol-owned liquidity to reduce friction and maintain tight pegs. The first step in building such a system is to re-think 'money' to be (1) on-chain and decentralized, (2) value-stable, (3) scalable, (4) modular, (5) open-source, (6) capital-efficient, (7) cross-chain, and (8) have protocol-owned liquidity based on a starfish topology. Spice Trade is the first protocol to encapsulate all of these principles into a suite of value-stable products.","links":"https://spicetrade.ai","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/spice-trade/logo.png"}
