{"name":"Spice Trade","id":"spice-trade","symbol":"spice","description":"The core thesis of the Spice Trade protocol is that there is a massive need for a decentralized, on-chain, open-source, value-stable, scalable, modular, cross-chain, and capital-efficient system for global trade. Such a system should have deep, long-term, and protocol-owned liquidity to reduce friction and maintain tight pegs. The first step in building such a system is to re-think 'money' to be (1) on-chain and decentralized, (2) value-stable, (3) scalable, (4) modular, (5) open-source, (6) capital-efficient, (7) cross-chain, and (8) have protocol-owned liquidity based on a starfish topology. Spice Trade is the first protocol to encapsulate all of these principles into a suite of value-stable products.","links":"https://spicetrade.ai","market_cap":490.85,"market_cap_rank":4405,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/spice-trade/logo.png","detail_platform":{"avalanche":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf30c5083a1479865c9a8916dec6ddadd82e8907b"},"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x66e8617d1df7ab523a316a6c01d16aa5bed93681"},"binancecoin":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x42586ef4495bb512a86cf7496f6ef85ae7d69a64"},"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x18a1ea69a50a85752b7bc204a2c45a95ce6e429d"}}}
