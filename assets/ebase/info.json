{"name":"eBASE","id":"ebase","symbol":"ebase","description":"eBASE Project Overview for CoinGecko: eBASE is a groundbreaking cryptocurrency project built on the BASE chain. It initiated with the first-ever community-wide airdrop, offering fair and equal opportunities to all participants. Notably, there were no presale events or favoritism towards insiders, and initial liquidity was securely locked. The core element of the eBASE project is its cutting-edge algorithmic trading bot. Developed since late 2020, this bot actively engages with the crypto markets, reacting to market volatility and volume. It strategically positions itself for long, short, or no trades to maximize returns. Historically, the eBASE trading bot has demonstrated strong performance on longer timeframes. Back-testing results from January 1, 2022, to August 31, 2023, showcase its potential, although it's essential to note that past performance is not a guarantee of future results. One of the unique features of eBASE is its staking program. Stakers of eBASE tokens are rewarded with ETH from a dedicated bot fund. Specifically, 1% of all trading volume is directed towards this fund, creating an incentive for token holders to participate and benefit from the project's trading activities.
