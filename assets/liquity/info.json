{"name":"Liquity","id":"liquity","symbol":"lqty","description":"LQTY is a token that captures the fee revenue generated by the Liquity Protocol via staking. Liquity is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows you to draw 0% interest loans against Ether used as collateral. Loans are paid out in LUSD and need to maintain a minimum collateral ratio of only 110%. In addition to the collateral, the loans are secured by a Stability Pool containing LUSD and by fellow borrowers collectively acting as guarantors of last resort. Liquity as a protocol is non-custodial, immutable, and governance-free.","links":"https://www.liquity.org/","market_cap":67406855,"market_cap_rank":493,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/liquity/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6dea81c8171d0ba574754ef6f8b412f2ed88c54d"},"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xfb9e5d956d889d91a82737b9bfcdac1dce3e1449"}}}
