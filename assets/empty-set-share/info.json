{"name":"Empty Set Share","id":"empty-set-share","symbol":"ess","description":"Empty Set Share is the new governance token in the Empty Set ecosystem. This token holds governance rights over the Empty Set protocol and will allow its holder to vote on and create proposals. This token will be created when the new version of the protocol launches. Users who hold ESD or Bonded ESD (ESDS) will be able to migrate their ESD/ESDS balances to ESS. This means that ESS has a hard cap related to the amount of ESD/ESDS migrated from the initial version of the protocol, however the Empty Set DAO has the ability to mint ESS via governance.","links":"https://emptyset.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/empty-set-share/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x24ae124c4cc33d6791f8e8b63520ed7107ac8b3e"}}}
