{"name":"QUALNET","id":"qualnet_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"qan","description":"QUALNET (QAN) is a pioneering Layer 1 blockchain engineered to provide a quantum-resistant foundation for the next generation of secure digital assets and decentralized applications. Leveraging a unique Proof-of-Quantum (PoQ) consensus mechanism and an integrated AI-driven optimization engine, QUALNET solves the critical security vulnerabilities inherent in classical elliptic curve cryptography. The network offers full EVM compatibility, allowing developers to deploy existing Ethereum-based dApps onto a future-proof, high-throughput environment. From securing Real-World Assets (RWA) to powering IoT solutions and decentralized AI, QUALNET serves as the essential security layer for a post-quantum digital economy.","links":"https://qan.xyz/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/qualnet/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf19f61bc9a2348a2fbc21209dddbbce2b98779a4","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xf19f61bc9a2348a2fbc21209dddbbce2b98779a4"}},"is_native":false}
