{"name":"Serey Coin","id":"serey-coin","symbol":"sry","description":"\"Serey is a next generation blockchain-based social media platform with an ecosystem of frontier decentralized applications (dApps) of Web 3.0. Our dApps will utilize the Serey blockchain to revolutionize industries and to bring added value to the society and to the people. With Serey we are aiming to decentralize content on the internet by connecting people to the platform and encouraging them to engage in social interactions. We believe that when we allow everyone to post and curate content, while giving them an economic and social incentive to be part of or to have a stake in the platform, information becomes more diverse and of higher quality. Information on Serey is stored on the blockchain and is distributed all over the world making it transparent, secure and immutable. Each user account on Serey receives an integrated wallet. The platformâ€™s native cryptocurrency is Serey coin (SRY), which can be transferred and used for payments. Serey coins can be earned by posting and curating content on the Serey platform or by maintaining the Serey network.\"","links":"https://serey.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/serey-coin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x2b618835a1eefcbf41e33497451ca1f3aa62f2d8"}}}
