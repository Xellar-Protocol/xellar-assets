{"name":"Edoverse Zeni","id":"edoverse-zeni","symbol":"zeni","description":"Edoverse is a unique metaverse which aims to recreate the virtual city of Edo where users begin their journey with an avatar as a ronin, or unemployed samurai, or in Edo city with its rules, regulation and social mores designed by the Tokugawa shogunate. ZENI is the native token of Edoverse, an exciting GameFi platform featuring samurai and ninjas. ZENI can be staked for enhanced rewards. Our web experience is about to go through a most radical transformation, possibly on par with the birth of the internet itself, with the advent of Metaverse, a virtual space constructed with state-of-the-art VR and 3D-CG technology that will serve, at once, as an ultra-user-friendly portal, a game platform, an e-commerce site, and a virtual society to be experienced through avatars.","links":"https://edoverse.io/","market_cap":271415,"market_cap_rank":3449,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/edoverse-zeni/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x9c6666d5ff4b53b5eb3bd866664c15d0bfcecaa7"}}}
