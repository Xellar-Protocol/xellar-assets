{"name":"Resolv USR","id":"resolv-usr_ethereum","symbol":"usr","description":"Resolv is a protocol that maintains USR, an overcollateralized stablecoin natively backed by Ether (ETH). USR achieves its peg by hedging its collateral pool and maintaining a tokenized insurance fund called RLP. Users can stake USR to obtain the yield-bearing version called stUSR. USR is minted by depositing liquid assets, such as USDC or USDT, on 1:1 value basis. When USR is redeemed, a user receives a 1:1 equivalent to the notional amount.","links":"https://www.resolv.xyz/","market_cap":334575629,"market_cap_rank":197,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/resolv-usr_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x66a1e37c9b0eaddca17d3662d6c05f4decf3e110","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x66a1e37c9b0eaddca17d3662d6c05f4decf3e110"}},"is_native":false}
