{"name":"ZKcandy","id":"zkcandy_ethereum","symbol":"candy","description":"ZKcandy is a Layer 2 ZKchain created as a strategic collaboration between iCandy Interactive and Matter Labs, designed to serve as the gaming and entertainment hub of the ZKsync ecosystem. Built on zkEVM technology, ZKchains are interconnected rollups that share a common settlement layer on Ethereum (L1), enabling high scalability, security, and interoperability. These ZKchains are connected through innovative “Hyperbridges,” which function like hyperlinks on the internet, allowing seamless movement of assets and data between chains. Within this framework, ZKcandy focuses on Web3 AI-enabled gaming and entertainment applications, making blockchain nearly invisible to users while empowering developers with powerful tools to create high-performance, engaging experiences.","links":"https://zkcandy.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/zkcandy/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc92fe380bf07fedc239a4b53639a6479fde8d30b","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xc92fe380bf07fedc239a4b53639a6479fde8d30b"}},"is_native":false}
