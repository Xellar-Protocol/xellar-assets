{"name":"Z","id":"z","symbol":"z","description":"Z is a BEP-20 meme token on BNB Smart Chain that pairs entertainment value with a clear-cut financial design. The contract was deployed with a fixed 1 000 000 000 supply, zero transfer taxes, and ownership renounced; the rules cannot be modified. At launch, 100 % of trading liquidity was created against USD1—World Liberty Financial’s fiat-backed, BitGo-custodied stablecoin—and the LP tokens were burned. This structure gives the community a light-hearted brand (Zippy the zebra) while anchoring price discovery to a dollar-pegged asset, making Z suitable for low-friction trading, tipping and future on-chain payments.","links":"https://zbnb.org","market_cap":148038,"market_cap_rank":6879,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/z/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd5cb08e3653ed8f78c781d8ac7f32b98f47e4444","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xd5cb08e3653ed8f78c781d8ac7f32b98f47e4444"}}}
