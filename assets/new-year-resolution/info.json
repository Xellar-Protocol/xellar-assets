{"name":"New Year Resolution","id":"new-year-resolution","symbol":"nyr","description":"NYR (New Year Resolution) is an experimental token designed to be as pure and lightweight as possible. There will be no owner, presale or team/dev tokens. There will also be no transactional taxes or hidden fees going to a hidden team. All the tokens will be put in the sale contract, keys to the liquidity wallet discarded. This means if you want to acquire NYR, there are no secret allocations or deals, it's simply being put out there to be used in whatever way the community wants, free from any centralised control.","links":"https://www.nyrtoken.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/new-year-resolution/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x3ecf9840deb8e3c395e1941fc39ceb662bf5a1dd"}}}
