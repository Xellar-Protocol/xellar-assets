{"name":"$KEK","id":"kek-2_solana","symbol":"$kek","description":"The El Risitas meme, also known as KEK, features a Spanish comedian, Juan Joya Borja, nicknamed \"El Risitas\" (\"The Giggles\"). The meme captures a segment from a Spanish TV interview where he tells a humorous story with his trademark infectious, high-pitched laugh. In meme culture, subtitles are added to reinterpret the story, often humorously exaggerating absurd situations or ironic mishaps. The laugh itself, with its \"KEK KEK\" sound, became iconic, leading to the meme's association with Kekistan and gaming culture. In short, he's the goat.","links":"https://kekcoin.fun/","market_cap":22957,"market_cap_rank":9510,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kek-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"2fZTwhbLg3xPquk8CqS3KKYbrNMbhKj7Q5zBKuT2pump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/2fZTwhbLg3xPquk8CqS3KKYbrNMbhKj7Q5zBKuT2pump"}},"is_native":false}
