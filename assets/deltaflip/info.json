{"name":"DeltaFlip","id":"deltaflip","symbol":"deltaf","description":"DeltaFlip is a platform where users will be able to coinflip their NFT's against other users. DeltaFlip revolves around tossing a coin toss, which gives the players a 50/50 chance to lose or win NFT's. A coin flip involves taking NFT's from your OpenSea inventory and turning them into credits, for which you then flip a coin. For one credit, DeltaFlip requires you to transfer the equivalent of $1 worth of NFT's. Before the coin flip, the draw machine assigns you and another player to a particular side of the coin (Heads/Tails), and then the player whose side wins, takes the pot. DeltaFlip will take a 3% tax on the total value of NFT's in each coinflip. This 3% tax will be used on $DELTAF token buybacks to ensure the price of $DELTAF is always rising. 29% supply is locked :https://bscscan.com/token/0x3D06CB9E8Fa1c7638a8B3D8d8B8755f1F6B7164B#balances","links":"https://deltaflip.net","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/deltaflip/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x3d06cb9e8fa1c7638a8b3d8d8b8755f1f6b7164b"}}}
