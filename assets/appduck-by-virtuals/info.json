{"name":"AppDuck by Virtuals","id":"appduck-by-virtuals","symbol":"duck","description":"AppDuck is an AI-powered venture builder that turns ideas into real, working products. It provides users with on-demand access to advanced AI agents that handle everything from frontend and backend development to market research, branding, and architecture. The platform simplifies the startup process by enabling anyone—regardless of technical background—to generate MVPs, test concepts, and see the first version of their idea with github exportable code before deploying full products. AppDuck is built for early-stage founders, developers, and communities who want to move fast without assembling full teams. It combines AI automation with a marketplace model and token incentives, creating a new way to build and fund digital products at scale. As the platform evolves, it will shift from human-to-agent workflows to fully autonomous agent-to-agent collaboration, enabling continuous product generation with minimal human input.","links":"https://appduck.ai/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/appduck-by-virtuals/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x67446a5746b5f1ce62d78f40f8c83dba03ae3e15","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x67446a5746b5f1ce62d78f40f8c83dba03ae3e15"}}}
