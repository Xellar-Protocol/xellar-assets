{"name":"OpenxAI","id":"openxai_base","symbol":"openx","description":"OpenxAI Network is the first peer-to-peer permissionless AI protocol. What Bitcoin did for money, OpenxAI does for intelligence. Anyone, anywhere can launch, own, and monetize AI apps, agents, and services fully on-chain. No banks. No corporations. No gatekeepers. Intelligence becomes open, sovereign, unstoppable. GPU compute becomes liquid with tokenized credits (tGPU). Built by core contributors from Fantom, Solana, ICP, Binance, NEAR, and AragonDAO, OpenxAI runs fully on decentralized infrastructure. It cuts GPU costs by up to 80% compared to AWS and Google, while enabling global AI deployment. Think AWS + Hugging Face + Stripe, rebuilt as a trustless Web3 protocol, open to everyone.","links":"https://openxai.org/","market_cap":1097319,"market_cap_rank":3645,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/openxai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa66b448f97cbf58d12f00711c02bac2d9eac6f7f","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xa66b448f97cbf58d12f00711c02bac2d9eac6f7f"}},"is_native":false}
