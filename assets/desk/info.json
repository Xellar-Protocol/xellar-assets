{"name":"DESK","id":"desk","symbol":"desk","description":"DESK is a next-generation DeFi perpetual trading infrastructure designed for both human traders and AI agents. The protocol combines two trading systems: a Pool-based model (evolved from the HMX platform) and a new Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) engine. DESK enables cross-margin trading, embedded money markets, real-time oracle feeds (via Pyth, Stork, RedStone), and modular integration with AI trading agents. Its architecture focuses on scalability, capital efficiency, and developer extensibility—making DESK a core building block for the future of onchain perps.","links":"https://desk.exchange/arbitrum","market_cap":1338150,"market_cap_rank":3778,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/desk/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe22865a7820823e27d6c630b15711b070cbd0d57","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/arbitrum/tokens/0xe22865a7820823e27d6c630b15711b070cbd0d57"}}}
