{"name":"BURN","id":"burn-3","symbol":"$burn","description":"$BURN is a deflationary token on the XRPL designed to reduce its own supply over time through manual and future automated burns. With an initial supply of 1 quadrillion, over 935.7 trillion tokens have already been burned, bringing the total supply down to 64.3 trillion. Unlike traditional tokens, $BURN does not rely on mining or staking; instead, it increases scarcity by permanently removing tokens from circulation. NFT sales on XRP Cafe contribute to buybacks and burns, reinforcing the token’s deflationary model. $BURN transactions settle in 3-5 seconds with minimal fees, benefiting from XRPL’s efficiency. Future developments include automated burn mechanisms, liquidity enhancements, and expanded ecosystem integration, ensuring long-term sustainability and deflationary impact.","links":"https://www.xrpburn.com","market_cap":306817,"market_cap_rank":5800,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/burn-3/logo.png","detail_platform":{"xrp":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":"4255524E00000000000000000000000000000000.rwgNTwrsZKPe7xYCy4emjFAYpgnuioHSkd","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/xrpl/tokens/4255524E00000000000000000000000000000000.rwgNTwrsZKPe7xYCy4emjFAYpgnuioHSkd"}}}
