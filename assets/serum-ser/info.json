{"name":"Serum SER","id":"serum-ser","symbol":"ser","description":"Serum is a decentralised autonomous brand or DAB, fueled by the SER token. It aims to give SER holders direct control through the use of the DAB. Serum aims to build a sustainable product by fixing two main problems. Firstly, tax tokens generate huge profits, but fail due to poor fund management, lack of utility, unsustainable revenue, and fake promises. Serum solves this problem by controlling funds with a legally binding escrow to ensure honest and responsible management of funds. Serum also builds multiple digital and IRL revenue streams and provides extensive utility for the SER token. Secondly, brands aren't keeping up with the concept of decentralisation and community. Serum solves this by giving community members direct control through the use of the DAB. The SER ecosystem revolves around the community.","links":"https://drinkserum.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/serum-ser/logo.png"}
