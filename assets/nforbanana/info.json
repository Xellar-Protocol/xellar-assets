{"name":"Banana","id":"nforbanana","symbol":"n","description":"In the ever-surprising world of crypto, Justin Sun, founder of Tron, made headlines after purchasing a taped banana art piece, sparking a viral frenzy. Sun then took to Twitter, cryptically linking his purchase to Tron with the phrase: \"N for Banana.\" This playful moment gave rise to Banana Coin, a memecoin with the ticker $N, built on the Tron blockchain. Combining humor, art, and blockchain innovation, $N embodies the essence of crypto culture: unpredictable, engaging, and driven by community enthusiasm. Whether it’s a clever nod to the meme economy or a new trendsetter, $N is already making waves in the Tron ecosystem, proving that even a banana can fuel the next big crypto phenomenon.","links":"https://nforbanana.com/","market_cap":55620,"market_cap_rank":8347,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nforbanana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"tron":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"TBBThLgHtUhGuT9DJ1rrzXDQ6j2XSP2Dq5","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/tron/tokens/TBBThLgHtUhGuT9DJ1rrzXDQ6j2XSP2Dq5"}}}
