{"name":"Horny Jail","id":"horny-jail","symbol":"jail","description":"The \"Horny Jail Bonk\" meme coin, often referred to as $JAIL, is a cryptocurrency on the Solana blockchain inspired by the \"Go to Horny Jail\" meme. This meme, which emerged around March 2020 on platforms like iFunny and Twitter, features a Doge character hitting a Cheems character with a stick or bat, captioned with \"Go to Horny Jail BONK.\" It’s used humorously to call out overly sexual or \"thirsty\" behavior online. The meme’s popularity led to its adaptation into a meme coin, capitalizing on the viral nature of the Doge and Cheems imagery.","links":"https://letsbonk.fun/token/yFtG6tU4mZqiUnrBC4gF9eXTdWyzj7ZSKb92wv3bonk","market_cap":843405,"market_cap_rank":3837,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/horny-jail/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"yFtG6tU4mZqiUnrBC4gF9eXTdWyzj7ZSKb92wv3bonk","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/yFtG6tU4mZqiUnrBC4gF9eXTdWyzj7ZSKb92wv3bonk"}}}
