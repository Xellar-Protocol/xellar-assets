{"name":"BULL Token","id":"bull-token","symbol":"$bull","description":"We've structured our tokenomics with a few things in mind. Our pre-sale gives the project the funds it needs for a healthy launch without favoring pre-sale buyers so much that it undermines a healthy public launch. Team allocation is very small and is intended to ensure we have the firepower we need for a smooth delivery. Plenty of tokens have been allocated for community rewards, CEX/DEX liquidity, and ongoing marketing.","links":"https://bulltokeneth.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bull-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x18c1074845c389907762a71242bfe271c9da2d9c"}}}
