{"name":"Angle Staked EURA","id":"staked-ageur","symbol":"steur","description":"stEUR is a staked version of agEUR earning a native Euro yield paid in agEUR. It is a yield-bearing ERC-20 token that can be freely transferred and that is always redeemable for an ever-growing amount of agEUR. The value of 1 stEUR is not meant to be 1€: it increases over time as yield continuously accrues to it.","links":"https://angle.money","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/staked-ageur/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x004626a008b1acdc4c74ab51644093b155e59a23","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x004626a008b1acdc4c74ab51644093b155e59a23"},"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x004626a008b1acdc4c74ab51644093b155e59a23","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/arbitrum/tokens/0x004626a008b1acdc4c74ab51644093b155e59a23"},"xdai":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x004626a008b1acdc4c74ab51644093b155e59a23","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/xdai/tokens/0x004626a008b1acdc4c74ab51644093b155e59a23"}}}
