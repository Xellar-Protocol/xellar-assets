{"name":"Xen Crypto (MATIC)","id":"xen-crypto-matic","symbol":"mxen","description":"This is an existing project on the Ethereum network. All information about this project was already included when it was listed. I would like to be able to track XEN on the MATIC network as it was done on the BSC network The request is motivated by the fact that XEN on the MATIC network is very popular, as is XEN on the BSC network. Many new protocols that are supposed to burn XEN start with the MATIC network, and that says something Xen on the MATIC network currently has 35,938,578 active minters. Total Supply of XEN on MATIC right now is 34,150,501,050,173","links":"https://xen.network/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/xen-crypto-matic/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x2ab0e9e4ee70fff1fb9d67031e44f6410170d00e"}}}
