{"name":"Eroverse","id":"eroverse","symbol":"ero","description":"Eroverse is a self-sustaining ecosystem built atop the Binance Smart Chain that intends to dominate the adult gaming market by empowering creators and consumers of digital erotica. For our creators, we offer a platform dedicated completely to the erotic gaming genre, paired with a lucrative business model unmatched by existing rival platforms. With the addition of our marketplace, Eroverse will allow for the sale of digital erotic art and the creation of NFTs. Game developers will be able to harness NFT technology to enhance their games, offer their consumers an experience beyond normal gameplay, and tap into ways to generate passive income utilizing cryptocurrency. For our gamers, we offer them titles that host our Play2Earn mechanic which rewards gamers with $BNB token as they progress and trigger achievements throughout the game. We also boast a leaderboard and award seasonal prizes to top players. It’s like Xbox, but there’s definitely nothing micro, nor anything soft about Eroverse! Eroverse utilizes Discord as its center of operations, housing its library of information and its loyal community of enthusiastic game developers, gamers, artists, art collectors, and investors. We welcome you to join in the adult fun at https://discord.com/invite/eroverse.","links":"https://eroverse.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/eroverse/logo.png"}
