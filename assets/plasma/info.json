{"name":"Plasma","id":"plasma","symbol":"xpl","description":"Plasma is a high-performance, scalable, and secure blockchain purpose-built for stablecoins. Traditional blockchains were designed long before stablecoins existed or gained traction. Today, stablecoins have over $225 billion in supply and see trillions of dollars transferred monthly, making them one of crypto’s most critical use cases. However, current blockchains face significant obstacles for stablecoins, such as high transaction fees, centralization issues, high transaction failure rates, and a lack of specialized features required to support stablecoins from first principles. With backing from Bitfinex/USDT0, Plasma is engineered from the ground up to meet the unique needs of stablecoins. Our team brings together expertise in software engineering at Apple and Microsoft, high-frequency trading at Goldman Sachs, distributed systems research at Imperial College London and Los Alamos National Lab, and hands-on experience building some of the largest stablecoins and blockchains.","links":"https://www.plasma.to/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/plasma/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
