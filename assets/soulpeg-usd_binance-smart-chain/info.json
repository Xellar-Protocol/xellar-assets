{"name":"SoulPeg USD","id":"soulpeg-usd_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"spusd","description":"SoulPeg USD (SPUSD) is a BEP-20 stablecoin wrapper for the non-transferable sUSDC deposit token. Users mint SPUSD by wrapping sUSDC and can always unwrap back to sUSDC; on redeem, SPUSD is burned. The $1 target is maintained on-chain by a simple market-making bot that trades the SPUSD/USDC v2 pool on PancakeSwap and by reserves deployed in transparent lending strategies (currently Venus). Contracts are verified on BscScan, liquidity is partially time-locked via PinkLock, and all docs/code are public.","links":"https://www.soulpeg.io/","market_cap":4504230,"market_cap_rank":2163,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/soulpeg-usd/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x40ff3dea2eec93a7b71879874dc4407918da77a6","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x40ff3dea2eec93a7b71879874dc4407918da77a6"}},"is_native":false}
