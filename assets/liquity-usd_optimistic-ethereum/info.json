{"name":"Liquity USD","id":"liquity-usd_optimistic-ethereum","symbol":"lusd","description":"LUSD is a fully redeemable USD-pegged stablecoin issued by the Liquity Protocol. Liquity is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows you to draw 0% interest loans against Ether used as collateral. Loans are paid out in LUSD and need to maintain a minimum collateral ratio of only 110%. In addition to the collateral, the loans are secured by a Stability Pool containing LUSD and by fellow borrowers collectively acting as guarantors of last resort. Liquity as a protocol is non-custodial, immutable, and governance-free.","links":"https://www.liquity.org/","market_cap":36372791,"market_cap_rank":782,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/liquity-usd/logo.png","detail_platform":{"optimistic-ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc40f949f8a4e094d1b49a23ea9241d289b7b2819","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/optimism/tokens/0xc40f949f8a4e094d1b49a23ea9241d289b7b2819"}},"is_native":false}
