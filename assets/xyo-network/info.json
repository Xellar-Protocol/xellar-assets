{"name":"XYO Network","id":"xyo-network","symbol":"xyo","description":"Our project is called the \"XY Oracle Network\" (XYO Network). The XYO Network enables trustless transactions through an ecosystem of crypto-location components that can bridge the gap from the world of today, to the world of tomorrow. The XYO Network makes it possible for smart contracts to access the real world by using the XYO Network's ecosystem of devices to determine if an object is at a specific XY-coordinate. If it is, one can set up applications which execute transactions in the smart contract. This has opened up a new world of possibilities. The applications of such a technology are infinite. Take for example an eCommerce Company. With the XYO Network, they could now offer their premium customers payment-upon-delivery services. To be able to offer this service, the eCommerce company would leverage the XYO Network (which uses XYO Tokens) to write a smart contract. The XYO Network could then track the location of the package being sent to the consumer along every single step of fulfillment; from the warehouse shelf to the shipping courier, all the way into the consumer's house and every location in between. This could enable eCommerce retailers and websites to verify, in a trustless way, that the package not only appeared on the customer's doorstep, but also safely inside their home.","links":"https://xyo.network/","market_cap":344357155,"market_cap_rank":299,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/xyo-network/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x55296f69f40ea6d20e478533c15a6b08b654e758"}}}
