{"name":"GenCoin Capital","id":"gencoin-capital","symbol":"gencap","description":"GenCoin Capital Token is a multi-function token that is uniquely designed to reward holders. One function of the token is Capital Investment, where the project will invest in other cryptocurrency projects to produce a yield. This yield is used to fund buybacks within GenCoin Capital to help maintain growth, as well as fund our Charity Initiatives. The second function of the project is a Giveaway utility in which holders are eligible to win giveaways that happen consistently throughout the project. Our first big charity initiative will be directed towards mental health awareness. The project will be working in the community to host charity donations and events to help give back.","links":"https://gencoincapital.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gencoin-capital/logo.png"}
