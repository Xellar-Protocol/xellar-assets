{"name":"Bitcoin Bob","id":"bitcoin-bob-2_ethereum","symbol":"₿o₿","description":"The viral “Bitcoin Bob” video is the earliest animated explainer about Bitcoin on YouTube—around 2010. It featured an Xtranormal-made cartoon with two characters, Bob and his friend , casually chatting about what Bitcoin is. It’s often titled something like “What is a Bitcoin?” and has become legendary among early crypto educators. Here’s what makes BOTCOIN BOB special: • The video was uploaded around November 10, 2010, right when Satoshi was still posting on Bitcointalk—each coin was worth around $0.30. • It features Bob encouraging viewers to “buy Bitcoin”—making him one of the earliest mascot-like figures in the crypto world .","links":"https://bitcoinbob.io/","market_cap":6276.52,"market_cap_rank":12021,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bitcoin-bob-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf86506384453d4875f7cfb31290b9b60daeb810a","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xf86506384453d4875f7cfb31290b9b60daeb810a"}},"is_native":false}
