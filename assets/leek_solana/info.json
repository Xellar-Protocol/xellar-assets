{"name":"LEEK","id":"leek_solana","symbol":"leek","description":"LEEK operates as a deflationary token on Solana, incorporating automated burn and earn smart contracts to reduce supply from 999M at launch in October 2024 to 913M currently. It applies a 1% transaction fee on Meteora pools, allocating 0.5% to LEEK burns and 0.5% to SOL airdrops for the top 50 holders every ~24 hours. Revenue from Solana-focused bots and tools, such as the SOL Holder Bot and Solana Booster Bot, supports token buybacks that are subsequently burned, enhancing scarcity. The project includes Leek Swap, a Jupiter-integrated terminal launched in December 2025, featuring a points and badge system where users earn points through swaps for eligibility in upcoming airdrops of LEEK and partner tokens like those from Concentric DAO.

The immutable SPL contract (Fdp3GvvkJZkaKLF7DBwLs5Ar1xeNgg4sPR3LCoSgXn58) ensures transparency, with trading on Raydium and Meteora pools. This structure leverages Solana's low fees and high throughput for efficient DeFi interactions, focusing on holder incentives without inflationary elements.","links":"https://leeksol.online","market_cap":263620,"market_cap_rank":5515,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/leek/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"Fdp3GvvkJZkaKLF7DBwLs5Ar1xeNgg4sPR3LCoSgXn58","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/Fdp3GvvkJZkaKLF7DBwLs5Ar1xeNgg4sPR3LCoSgXn58"}},"is_native":false}
