{"name":"TWEET","id":"tweet","symbol":"tweet","description":"$TWEET is the new bird in town bringing on-chain interactions directly to 𝕏 (formerly Twitter). It's no longer necessary to switch between apps and wallets while scanning the market and KOLs on 𝕏 before buying your favorite coin. You can now seamlessly do this all directly on 𝕏, and much more. We offer the ability to buy/sell crypto directly on X with a public tweet, as well as through a conversation with our bot in DMs. Further, we enable users to send crypto to anyone with an @ X handle, and support communities/projects with our unique Airdrop feature to send crypto to large groups with one single tweet (e.g. to award community prizes or competitions).","links":"https://tweet.money","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/tweet/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x004f747a91e05d0e2fbe8bf3cd39cdb2bcfab02c"}}}
