{"name":"Pack","id":"pack","symbol":"pack","description":"$PACK is a crypto marketing and educational platform introducing investors to other projects in the space while diversifying their holders portfolio through passive rewards. $PACK is a token intended to bridge the gap between the Ethereum chain, and Shibarium. With the bombardment of new projects claiming to be “the next best thing”, who are we to believe? At $PACK we will be inviting you, the community, to take part in this decision making process, and be rewarded for your insight. Projects will enter the den, and pitch their project on VC to the Pack leaders. In turn, these leaders will compile a ballot for the pack to vote upon. Each week, three projects will be chosen for The Pack’s war-chest to invest in, and distribute as rewards to the community. Doing so, will provide The Pack with a diverse portfolio of tokens and tools to transition into the Shibarium successfully.","links":"http://packtoken.xyz/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pack/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb186035490c8602ead853ec98be05e3461521ab2"}}}
