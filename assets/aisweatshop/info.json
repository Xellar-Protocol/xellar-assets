{"name":"AISweatShop","id":"aisweatshop","symbol":"defai","description":"AiSweatShop (A.S.S.) is an open-source framework aimed at deploying autonomous AI agents (often called “DeFAI” agents) with decentralized financial capabilities. Built on Arbitrum’s Layer-2 blockchain, AiSweatShop integrates elements of decentralized finance (DeFi) into AI agents, allowing them to independently manage tokens, liquidity, and related financial operations. By serving as a foundational infrastructure—sometimes compared to a “Federal Reserve” for AI agents—AiSweatShop focuses on establishing stable, secure, and scalable conditions for these AI-driven ecosystems to operate.","links":"https://aisweat.shop/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/aisweatshop/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x13ad3f1150db0e1e05fd32bdeeb7c110ee023de6","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/arbitrum/tokens/0x13ad3f1150db0e1e05fd32bdeeb7c110ee023de6"}}}
