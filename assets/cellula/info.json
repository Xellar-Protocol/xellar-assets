{"name":"CELLULA","id":"cellula","symbol":"cela","description":"What Is Cellula? Cellula is pioneering a programmable incentive layer that is transforming asset issuance on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem by third party projects building out their digital asset tokenomics distribution. At the core of Cellula's innovation is its virtual Proof-of-Work (vPOW) consensus mechanism, which combines principles from Conway's Game of Life, Variable Rate GDAs Algorithm, and Game Theory. What Is the CELA Token? $CELA is central to the Cellula ecosystem, serving as a multifaceted asset that fuels BitLife and facilitates staking participation. The design of $CELA ensures that as the Cellula ecosystem expands, its utility value increases, aligning the interests of token holders, and the team. The utility of the $CELA token will be introduced in different stages of Cellula, including but not limited to the following functions: * Minting BitLife: BitMiners can spend a certain amount of $CELA to mint their 4x4 BitLife; only BitMiners can mint 4x4 BitLife. * Charging BitLife: Users who hold BitLife will need to use $CELA to charge in order to gain $esCELA. * Staking Rewards: Users can stake $CELA in the $CELA staking pool, BitMiners can stake to earn BitLife minting rights, BitAgent can stake to earn BitLife selling rights. Additionally, the Cellula team is exploring more ways to enhance the utility of $CELA, increasing its value and incentive for users.","links":"https://www.cellula.life/","market_cap":51336,"market_cap_rank":8484,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cellula/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc790ac3b67c42302555d928e5644b848c557e319","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xc790ac3b67c42302555d928e5644b848c557e319"}}}
