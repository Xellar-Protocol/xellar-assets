{"name":"Radiate Protocol","id":"radiate-protocol","symbol":"radt","description":"Radiate Protocol is a yield enhancing protocol built on top of Radiant Capital. Radiate allows Radiant depositors to earn $RDNT emissions without locking any of their own dLP. On the other hand, Radiant allows liquidity providers earn boosted yields on dLP with no lockups. Users can earn up to 40% APY on stablecoins, or other assets such as WETH, WSTETH, and WBTC. Stakers can do single sided staking for DLP and earn WETH denominated yields. No need to worry about claiming multiple tokens or worrying about locking for certain durations.","links":"https://radiateprotocol.com","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/radiate-protocol/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x7ca0b5ca80291b1feb2d45702ffe56a7a53e7a97"}}}
