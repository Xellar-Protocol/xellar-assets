{"name":"Astar","id":"astar","symbol":"astr","description":"Astar Network is a dApp hub on Polkadot that supports Ethereum, WebAssembly, and layer 2 solutions like ZK Rollups. Astar aims to be a multi-chain smart contract platform that will support multiple blockchains and virtual machines. Polkadot Relay Chain doesn’t support smart contracts. That’s why it’s important for the ecosystem to have a parachain that enables this for all developers who want to build in the Polkadot ecosystem. Astar is here to provide the best solution for all developers by supporting EVM and making a parachain where EVM and WASM smart contracts can co-exist and communicate with each other.","links":"https://astar.network/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/astar/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
