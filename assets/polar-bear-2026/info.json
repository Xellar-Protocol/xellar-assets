{"name":"Polar Bear 2026","id":"polar-bear-2026","symbol":"ойойойойой","description":"Polar Bear 2026 is a decentralized, community-driven cryptocurrency project inspired by a popular and ominous meme that first gained traction in 2023. The meme showcases an AI-generated image of a polar bear balancing solely on its front paws, a visual that emerged from the depths of future predictions for the year 2026. The lore around this enigmatic bear traces its origins back to Russian TikTok users who utilized a haunting “yoyoyoyoyo” sound from the track “Cumbia Masonica” in their videos. This sound later became synonymous with the meme, embedding itself further in the cryptic narrative of Polar Bear 2026. With a total supply of 1 trillion tokens, the project emphasizes its commitment to decentralization by burning all liquidity, renouncing ownership, and imposing zero taxes on transactions. While the project operates primarily as a meme coin, devoid of intrinsic value or financial expectations, it serves as a testament to the cultural phenomenon that memes can shape and influence the cryptosphere. Remember, $ойойойойойо is solely for entertainment, so tread with caution and a sense of humor.","links":"https://polarbear2026.tech/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/polar-bear-2026/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":"0x061a1a443e3be3a679d3504e65175842da72365d"}}}
