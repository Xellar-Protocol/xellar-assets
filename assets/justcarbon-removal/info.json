{"name":"JustCarbon Removal","id":"justcarbon-removal","symbol":"jcr","description":"JustCarbon was founded by finance, crypto and blue carbon experts. JustCarbon's founders want voluntary carbon markets (VCMs) to be available to all, not just large corporates and expensive middlemen. JustCarbon wants to scale access to funding for project developers and ensure everyone has the opportunity to fight climate change. JustCarbon Removal Units or JCRs represent one tonne of physical carbon sequestrated from the atmosphere. JustCarbon only deals in recent removal meaning all offsets are nature-based and backed by the highest standards (VCS, GS). JustCarbon affords access to voluntary carbon markets through tokenisation; all credits are visible and recordings are stored on the blockchain. JustCarbon never owns JCRs, it simply mints them and ensures their transparency and quality. JustCarbon is also pushing for decentralisation, VCMs shouldn't be concentrated in the hands of the few. The JustCarbon DAO has minted 1 billion governance tokens (JCGs) to give everyone a stake in the future of JustCarbon. Through this mechanism, users will decide the future of JCRs as well.","links":"https://www.justcarbon.com","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/justcarbon-removal/logo.png"}
