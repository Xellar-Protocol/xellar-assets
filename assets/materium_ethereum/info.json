{"name":"Materium","id":"materium_ethereum","symbol":"mtrm","description":"In Mirandus, players have absolute freedom of choice - there are no maps, no quest givers. Players can set out into the wilderness alone to try their fortunes against the monsters of the deep woods and dungeons, join with one of the monarchs to serve as a knight in their court, or set up shop in one of the five great citadels of the realm. Players take on the role of avatars in the world, and if desired, can purchase an exemplar avatar with powers and abilities beyond those of others in Mirandus. Player ownership of in-game assets is a central mechanic, with players being able to hold land deeds which allow them to claim parts of the wilderness and set up holdfasts ranging from small farms to massive cities. The risks of exploring Mirandus are great – but so are the rewards, for Mirandus is rich in the arcane substance Materium, a concentrated magic that allows players to channel its power to cast spells, craft the impossible, and even raise a slain hero from the dead.","links":"https://mirandus.game/","market_cap":180470,"market_cap_rank":6075,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/materium/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":0,"contract_address":"0xcd17fa52528f37facb3028688e62ec82d9417581","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xcd17fa52528f37facb3028688e62ec82d9417581"}},"is_native":false}
