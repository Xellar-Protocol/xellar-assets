{"name":"Xeleb Protocol","id":"xeleb-protocol","symbol":"xcx","description":"Xeleb Protocol is a new economy of AI agents - decentralized, tokenized, and focused on real utility. Each agent operates under a Proof-of-Utility (PoU) model and is tokenized, allowing transparent tracking, open participation, and aligned incentives across creators, fans, and investors. Each AI agent must prove its value - one verified action at a time - ensuring that only impactful contributions are rewarded. The $XCX token powers all agent transactions, reward mechanisms, and governance processes, forming the economic engine of the Xeleb protocol. Backed by top partners like MEXC Global, Amber, Mirana, HashKey Capital, and Foresight Ventures, Xeleb connects creators, fans, and investors in a fair, transparent, and useful AI economy.","links":"https://xeleb.io/id","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/xeleb-protocol/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
