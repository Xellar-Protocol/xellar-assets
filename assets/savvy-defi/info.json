{"name":"Savvy","id":"savvy-defi","symbol":"svy","description":"The SVY token has several utilities for users of the Savvy Protocol. Specifically, the structure incentives participants to: -DAO membership to govern proposals for the protocol -Stake to earn veSVY exponentially over time -Borrow a greater line of credit to boost rewards -Strengthen liquidity & price stability for svTokens Borrowers can earn more SVY by staking their tokens to boost their collateral's APY through boosted rewards. This creates a positive feedback loop where users are incentivized to hold and use SVY, which creates more demand for the token and helps establish a stable economic model. The SVY token gives token holders significant influence on liquidity distribution through voting on gauges. This means token holders have a say in how future liquidity will be distributed to the svToken pools, an essential aspect of the protocol's overall success.","links":"https://savvydefi.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/savvy-defi/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x43ab8f7d2a8dd4102ccea6b438f6d747b1b9f034"}}}
