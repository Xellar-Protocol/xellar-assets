{"name":"USX","id":"usx","symbol":"usx","description":"USX is a Solana-based stablecoin designed to provide a secure, efficient, and transparent digital dollar for both institutional and retail users. It is created through over-collateralization with leading stablecoins, ensuring that every USX in circulation is backed 1:1 with assets like USDT or USDC. Unlike legacy stablecoins that simply hold reserves, USX is built to integrate directly into the broader DeFi ecosystem, where it acts as a core liquidity layer for trading, lending, and payments. Its purpose is to offer a dollar-pegged asset that can move at the speed and scale of Solana while maintaining reliability for settlements and financial transactions. By combining stability with seamless composability, USX serves as a foundational building block for protocols, payment processors, and institutions seeking trusted dollar liquidity in the crypto economy.","links":"https://solsticelabs.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/usx/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"6FrrzDk5mQARGc1TDYoyVnSyRdds1t4PbtohCD6p3tgG","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/6FrrzDk5mQARGc1TDYoyVnSyRdds1t4PbtohCD6p3tgG"}}}
