{"name":"Scorefam","id":"scorefam","symbol":"sft","description":"Scorefam Token is a new digital asset for sport lovers, designed to be used for transactions on and outside the Scorefam Platform. Our project is set up to innovate the way we use blockchain technology in gaming, by creating a bridge between the cryptosphere and the world of Football. To put it simply: we created a crypto token, a football gaming platform using blockchain technology and issuing our own cryptocurrency (SFT). Our mission is to bridge the gap between the crypto world and the world of sports. In doing that, we offer a degree of anonymity and complete ownership over the game assets, and from a broader point of view, we bring our contribution to the mass adoption of DLT (Distributed Ledger Technologies) such as blockchain. We believe in the future of our gaming platform and its global adoption, so our vision is to become a major player in sports gaming with fans all over the world while building a strong and healthy game crypto economy. Scorefam has come to offer a blockchain sports gaming service where users earn by predicting and staking, engaging in the football fantasy league and trading NFT player cards, all on the Scorefam platform with ease. This brings a significant advantage to Scorefam, giving the token an edge when compared to existing crypto tokens.","links":"http://www.scorefam.org","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/scorefam/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"0xcb73918ac58d0c90d71c7992637c61094c15305b"}}}
