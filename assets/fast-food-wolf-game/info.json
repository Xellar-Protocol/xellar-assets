{"name":"Fast Food Wolf Game","id":"fast-food-wolf-game","symbol":"ffwool","description":"\"Thousands of Sheep and Wolves compete on-chain for $FFWOOL, with high stakes. Fully decentralized. Low Fees and Sub Second Finality and fully functional! Fast Food Wolf Game shows what’s possible with interactions between the ERC-20 and ERC-721 protocols on Polygon. For the very first time, your NFT can steal other NFTs (ERC-721) for you. The rarer your NFT, the more tokens you'll accumulate probabilistically! - There will only ever be 10,000 Gen Zero, minted with MATIC. The 40,000 Gen 1 are minted by farming $FFWOOL - Sheep can be staked in the Barn to earn $FFWOOL and pay a tax anytime they claim their $FFWOOL earnings - If a Sheep is unstaked from the Barn, the Wolves try to steal all of its accumulated $FFWOOL - When a new Sheep is born, the Wolves attempt to kidnap it. If they’re successful, it’s given to a randomly selected Wolf, instead of the owner who minted it Whitepaper: https://fastfoodwolfgame.com/whitepaper\"","links":"https://fastfoodwolfgame.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/fast-food-wolf-game/logo.png"}
