{"name":"Web3 Whales","id":"what-do-you-meme","symbol":"w3w","description":"What Do You Meme is a project created by Youtuber Fomotion. The goal of the project is to colletivelly invest in crypto launchpads like Seedify, Enjinstarter Dao Maker and many more. For 1 single person it could be really hard to get a good and profitable tier in a good launchpad. But with an entire community, it's way more easy. What Do You Meme has a small buy and sell tax which will be used for this. On our Dapp people can not only buy/sell our token, use the DAO voting system to decide the move we will make, bt also stake their $WDYM tokens. Based on the amount and the period a user stakes the token, he/she can claim their share of these launchpad profits.","links":"https://www.wdymcrypto.com","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/what-do-you-meme/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0079914b3c6ff1867b62c2cf8f108126970eab6e"}}}
