{"name":"Kinect Finance","id":"kinect-finance","symbol":"knt","description":"The Kinect Protocol aims to solve the problems of other existing yield farms, yield aggregators, staking platforms, and farming rewards. Yield farming often looks very attractive to investors due to extremely large interest rates. Although, a problem in today's defi ecosystem is that rewards often have to be paid out by using artificial inflation. This is a problem but is also necessary for these protocols to function, because without inflation, platforms wouldnâ€™t be able to offer enticing interest rates to investors. Although, it gives participants little reason to want to hold the token because it will be losing value as it becomes more diluted. Historically yield farming platforms will have great price action at first, as their large interest rates attract new investors and a large amount of capital to the platform. However, once the rate of new users onboarding starts to peak and there is less new capital buying up the tokens that are being minted. It ends up with the price starting to consistently decline as the market gets more and more diluted with freshly minted tokens and sell pressure builds up. The Kinect Protocol has been developed in a way that solves all of these problems and uses it beneficially.","links":"https://kinect.finance","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kinect-finance/logo.png"}
