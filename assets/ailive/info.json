{"name":"ailive","id":"ailive","symbol":"ailive","description":"AILIVE is a novel project designed to democratize machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). By providing a robust, intuitive platform, we aim to make AI accessible to everyone—so they can understand the basic principles of machine learning and experiment with it. Our focus is to empower individuals to train, understand and deploy their own 3D AI agents with minimal barriers. Accessibility for machine learning lies at the heart of the AILIVE mission. Despite the explosion of interest in AI, most platforms remain excessively complex, requiring specialized knowledge and significant computational resources. AILIVE seeks to streamline and simplify this process. By offering an integrated framework that is intuitive, transparent, and well-documented, we remove many obstacles that often inhibit newcomers.","links":"https://ailive.co","market_cap":26486,"market_cap_rank":8407,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ailive/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"3He53vyEdBSD3Pxx5vAJ4AzQz3GXLXYBvKcYiTJ2pump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/3He53vyEdBSD3Pxx5vAJ4AzQz3GXLXYBvKcYiTJ2pump"}}}
