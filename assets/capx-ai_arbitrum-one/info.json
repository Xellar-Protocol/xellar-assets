{"name":"Capx AI","id":"capx-ai_arbitrum-one","symbol":"capx","description":"Capx is an Ethereum Layer 2 powering the Nasdaq of AI Apps, where users can trade AI App tokens. The project combines scalable blockchain infrastructure with application and cloud layers, purpose-built to support tokenized AI application layer. Capx enables developers to build consumer-facing AI agent apps, tokenize them, and trade their tokens in a secure and composable environment. The Capx Chain is built using Arbitrum Orbit and offers fast finality and low-cost transactions. The Capx Superapp (app.capx.ai) is the primary interface for both developers and users. It functions as a platform for discovering, using, and trading AI apps. Available on web and mobile, the Capx App is structured to provide app store-like discoverability of AI apps, while integrating token-based trading mechanics inspired by modern consumer trading platforms. Capx Cloud is the decentralized hosting and deployment layer for AI apps and agents. It is built on top of Symbiotic, a restaking protocol that allows cloud operators to provide compute and availability guarantees for hosted agents. Capx is focused on supporting the consumer-facing AI app layer by enabling the end-to-end lifecycle of AI agent apps - from development and deployment to discovery and monetization.","links":"https://capx.ai","market_cap":22076227,"market_cap_rank":1057,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/capx-ai_arbitrum-one/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x97e66d3c4d5bcd7c64e3e55af28544c9addf9281","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/arbitrum/tokens/0x97e66d3c4d5bcd7c64e3e55af28544c9addf9281"}},"is_native":false}
