{"name":"Eggs Finance","id":"eggs-finance","symbol":"eggs","description":"Eggs Finance is a DeFi protocol built on the Sonic blockchain. It utilizes the EGGS token, which is secured by S tokens in the protocol, to facilitate loans with 99% LTV. Borrow S by using EGGS as collateral. Burning mechanisms ensure that the ratio of S per EGGS in the contract can only increase. This creates intrinsic value, or a price floor, for EGGS within the protocol and prevents loans from falling under collateral. EGGS can be redeemed for the underlying S on the dApp.","links":"https://eggs.finance","market_cap":11516212,"market_cap_rank":1694,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/eggs-finance/logo.png","detail_platform":{"sonic":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf26ff70573ddc8a90bd7865af8d7d70b8ff019bc","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/sonic/tokens/0xf26ff70573ddc8a90bd7865af8d7d70b8ff019bc"}}}
