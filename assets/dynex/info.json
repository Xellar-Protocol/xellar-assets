{"name":"Dynex","id":"dynex","symbol":"dnx","description":"The World’s First Decentralised Neuromorphic Supercomputing Platform #Dynex is a fast growing next-generation platform for neuromorphic computing based on a groundbreaking flexible blockchain protocol. It consists of participating nodes that constitute a decentralised neuromorphic supercomputing network which is capable of performing computations at unprecedented speed and efficiency — even exceeding quantum computing. #Decentralised Neuromorphic Computing By transforming traditional inefficient computers into neuromorphic chips, we will finally be able to create new discoveries. To achieve this goal, every computer, every laptop and even every mobile device available needs to be connected. As a community and with collaborative effort we can take the next step towards sustainability and efficacy. Transform your phone, your old computer or your dormant mining equipment into neuromorphic machines, earn money and generate wealth. #Energy efficient — green & sustainable In light of the growing threat of climate change to our environment and our future, it is imperative that we take every measure necessary to reduce global energy consumption. An accelerated adoption of neuromorphic computing will therefore benefit our entire society since it uses orders of magnitude less energy compared to traditional computing systems. #Listing Dynex is delighted to announce its initial exchange listing on https://txbit.io, an upcoming cryptocurrency exchange listed on CoinMarketCap.
