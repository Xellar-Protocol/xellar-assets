{"name":"f(x) Protocol","id":"fxn-token","symbol":"fxn","description":"What is the project about? f(x) Protocol creates two new ETH derivative assets, one with stablecoin-like low volatility and the second a leveraged long ETH perpetual token. These tokens are created by separating ETH collateral into a lower-volatility token named fETH, and a higher-volatility token named xETH. What makes your project unique? f(x) Protocol is bult with the aim of creating a symbiotic system that decomposes ETH into two useful tokens. For fETH, the goal is to produce a low volatility token which: Is fully decentralized and Ethereum-native; Minimizes volatility while retaining a small exposure to the market; Can be minted and redeemed instantly in direct response to stablecoin demand; Has maximum liquidity depth based on a multiple of demand for xETH, rather than a fraction of demand for CDPs. Specifically for xETH, we create a leveraged long ETH token which: Is fully decentralized and Ethereum-native; Is composable, with liquidity on-chain; Has extremely low risk of liquidation. What can your token be used for? f(x) will adopt ve tokenomics. Locking FXN will receive veFXN. The longer the lock time, the more veFXN received. 75% of treasury revenue will be distributed to veFXN holders.","links":"https://fx.aladdin.club","market_cap":5412338,"market_cap_rank":1985,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/fxn-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x365accfca291e7d3914637abf1f7635db165bb09"}}}
