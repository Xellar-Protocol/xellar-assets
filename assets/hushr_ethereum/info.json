Just pure, encrypted communication executed wallet to wallet. Real-time encryption, powered by adaptive AI, ensures that messages stay private, persistent, and tamper-proof. From private chats to public forums, NFT-holder broadcasts, stealth token transfers, and secure DAO inboxes, Hushr delivers a fully integrated experience with zero reliance on Web2 systems. In-chat smart contract triggers and agent-native interactions make Hushr more than a messenger. It’s a programmable communications layer that gives users and communities new ways to coordinate, govern, and transact—without needing to trust any platform, team, or intermediary.","links":"https://hushr.io/","market_cap":8520.38,"market_cap_rank":11492,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/hushr/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8079751edb6bf16078b07585ee60010f430617d5","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x8079751edb6bf16078b07585ee60010f430617d5"}},"is_native":false}
