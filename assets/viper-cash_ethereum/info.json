{"name":"Viper Cash","id":"viper-cash_ethereum","symbol":"vip","description":"VIPER CASH is a censorship-resistant bridge that connects Zcash-grade privacy to any chain. Instead of broadcasting transactions to public mempools, users sign encrypted intents (e.g., swap USDC on Base → receive SOL on Solana). Off-chain solvers compete to provide the best all-in execution price, and settlement occurs through RAILGUN shielded pools and Relay cross-chain proofs with no linkable addresses, no orderflow leakage, and no centralized custodians. The native token, VIP, powers the network by enabling gasless transfers, fee rebates, and relayer/solver participation, ensuring privacy, neutrality, and censorship-resistance by design.","links":"https://www.viper.cash/","market_cap":32923,"market_cap_rank":8858,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/viper-cash_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x128ec47d961e5ad39455ff071d7931195586f38c","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x128ec47d961e5ad39455ff071d7931195586f38c"}},"is_native":false}
