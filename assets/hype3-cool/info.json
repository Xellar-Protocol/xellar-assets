The platform facilitates programmable licensing, automated revenue distribution, and AI model training integration for various forms of intellectual property, including memes, art, celebrity content, and scientific research. Through its swarm of AI-powered IP agents, HYPE3 automates the complex processes of IP management, licensing, and monetization. The framework addresses traditional IP industry challenges by implementing a global, blockchain-based system that replaces manual, jurisdiction-specific processes. HYPE3's infrastructure enables real-time revenue tracking, automated royalty payments, and simplified collaboration between creators. The platform also serves as a standardized interface for AI models to access and train on properly licensed IP data, creating a sustainable ecosystem where IP creators are fairly compensated for their contributions to AI development.","links":"https://hype3.cool/","market_cap":127960,"market_cap_rank":7074,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/hype3-cool/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"9iQFnxrDDMFrhLx2pYJCDeqN3wFuaBimQkUnZQHNpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/9iQFnxrDDMFrhLx2pYJCDeqN3wFuaBimQkUnZQHNpump"}}}
