{"name":"Freedom Dollar","id":"freedom-dollar","symbol":"fusd","description":"Freedom Dollar (ticker fUSD) is an over-collateralised, algorithmic stable asset issued on the Zano privacy blockchain. Each fUSD targets one U.S. dollar of purchasing power and is backed by a public reserve of ZANO that initially exceeds the liability by roughly a factor of ten. Anyone may add to the decentralization of the network by running an open source market making node. Collateral is held in transparent on-chain addresses and is continuously staked, so its yield compounds the buffer automatically. Because Zano uses ring signatures and stealth addresses, fUSD transfers inherit native Zano level privacy while remaining censorship-resistant—there is no admin freeze key or custodial bank account. The design therefore offers a dollar-like unit for users who prefer permission-less, non-KYC rails.","links":"https://www.freedomdollar.com/","market_cap":1300049,"market_cap_rank":3357,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/freedom-dollar/logo.png","detail_platform":{"zano":{"decimal_place":4,"contract_address":"86143388bd056a8f0bab669f78f14873fac8e2dd8d57898cdb725a2d5e2e4f8f"}}}
