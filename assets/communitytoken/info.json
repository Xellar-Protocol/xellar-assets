The basic algorithm is based on collective intelligence, and is operated as a process of Quest, Choice & Voting, and Reward. It covers all the knowledge of the world, including Art & Culture, Society, Competition, Collective resolution, Economy, and Science. It recognizes the predicted result of the fusion process of the collective intelligence generated before the actual result is derived. Once the actual result is drawn, users who voted in the correct answer will be rewared. “COJAM” is a platform that seeks solutions to uncertainties based on past experiences and presents current problems from a future perspective.","links":"https://www.cojam.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/communitytoken/logo.png"}
