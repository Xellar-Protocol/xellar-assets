{"name":"Lepricon","id":"lepricon","symbol":"l3p","description":"Lepricon is reimagining the possibilities of entertainment through technology, and we’re building a tech stack to prove one immutable fact; that gaming can and should be the first killer on-ramp for the mass adoption of blockchain utility. To facilitate the mainstream gaming industry’s adoption and incorporation of blockchain utility, Lepricon have developed a high-speed, fully gasless side-chain which sits beside the Ethereum network, to serve as the perfect infrastructure for in-game economies. Leprichain and all of the dApps that run on it are powered by our ERC-20 utility token, L3P. Lepricon’s DeFi portal will enable L3P holders to manage their tokens, participate in governance, and benefit from advanced yield-earning activities. Lepricon’s DeFi portal will launch towards the end of the fourth quarter of 2021.
