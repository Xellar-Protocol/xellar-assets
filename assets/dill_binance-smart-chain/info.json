{"name":"Dill","id":"dill_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"dl","description":"Dill, a new paradigm chain based on a modular and sharded architecture, capable of achieving maximum scalability, sovereignty, and decentralization: - Maximum scalability: Dill supports up to 800,000 TPS, which is approximately 100 times the scalability of existing high-performance monolithic chains. - Maximum sovereignty: Each application deployed on Dill has its own dedicated execution environment, allowing it to capture the value of the execution layer while enabling custom execution environments. - Maximum decentralization: Dill supports up to 1 million validators while maintaining low barriers for staking and node operation, making it accessible to solo stakers.\\ The protocol combines the advantages of both solutions by adopting a modular internal structure while maintaining an externally unified architecture. This approach ensures the high scalability, sovereignty and decentralization that modularity brings while avoiding the ecosystem fragmentation caused by Layer 2.","links":"https://www.dill.xyz/","market_cap":2744763,"market_cap_rank":2633,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dill/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xcd806d0eb9465020994c9e977cbe34fe430172ae","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xcd806d0eb9465020994c9e977cbe34fe430172ae"}},"is_native":false}
