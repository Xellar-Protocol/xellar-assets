{"name":"Intercoin","id":"intercoin","symbol":"itr","description":"Intercoin is building a decentralized payment platform that is intended to serve as a bridge among decentralized payment networks of various affinity groups, organizations, and other communities. The Company is also seeking to develop technology that will allow any community (for example, a cruise line, casino, resort operator, club, university, city or town) to customize, issue and manage its own currency in the form of digital community coins (i.e., the Community Coins), by simply downloading and deploying the software on a number of community-based computers. In essence, this technology will allow communities to create \"\"private label\"\" digital currencies on dedicated distributed ledgers with relatively little upfront investment of financial or human resources.","links":"https://intercoin.org/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/intercoin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x1111158f88410da5f92c7e34c01e7b8649bc0155"}}}
