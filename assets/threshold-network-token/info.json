{"name":"Threshold Network","id":"threshold-network-token","symbol":"t","description":"Threshold is a project merged from the NuCypher and Keep networks, which strives to provide different threshold cryptography solutions in a fully decentralized manner to the web3 community. Threshold cryptography is a technology that uses cryptography to unlock greater utility and usability for digital assets without needing to trust a centralized party. Threshold cryptography distributes sensitive operations across multiple independent entities – like nodes in a network – and requires a threshold, or minimum number of those entities to cooperate for the operation to be successful.","links":"https://threshold.network/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/threshold-network-token/logo.png"}
