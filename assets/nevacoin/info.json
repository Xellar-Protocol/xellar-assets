At 1457344680 unix time is my girlfriend's 25th birthday (her name is Neva if that isn't obvious) and since she is abroad at the moment I figured this is the best gift I can give her remotely. Who wouldn't want a global decentralized peer to peer network cryptocurrency platform named after them as a birthday gift, right? Don't worry, I will also give her a less geeky gift when she comes back","links":"https://nevacoin.net/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nevacoin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe7498f332c35a346b486f3f6a68f05934e92a228"}}}
