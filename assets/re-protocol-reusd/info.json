{"name":"Re Protocol reUSD","id":"re-protocol-reusd","symbol":"reusd","description":"Re Protocol (RE) is a blockchain-based platform that democratizes access to reinsurance risk by tokenizing exposure to insurance contracts. The protocol’s two deposit tokens—reUSD and reUSDe—let users choose between a principal-protected, fixed-yield product (reUSD, RF + 250 bps) or a risk-bearing, variable-yield option (reUSDe, up to ~23 % APR). Built on Ethereum, Avalanch, Arbitrum and Base, Re Protocol leverages decentralized underwriting pools to generate transparent, market-driven insurance returns. Governance and treasury functions are overseen by the Cayman-based Re Foundation to ensure regulatory compliance and capital efficiency. With integrations into DeFi ecosystems like Curve, Pendle, and Ethena, Re Protocol bridges traditional reinsurance markets and DeFi—opening institutional-grade risk diversification to crypto investors.","links":"https://re.xyz","market_cap":9714.69,"market_cap_rank":9587,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/re-protocol-reusd/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x5086bf358635b81d8c47c66d1c8b9e567db70c72","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x5086bf358635b81d8c47c66d1c8b9e567db70c72"},"avalanche":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x180af87b47bf272b2df59dccf2d76a6eafa625bf","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/avax/tokens/0x180af87b47bf272b2df59dccf2d76a6eafa625bf"},"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x76ce01f0ef25aa66cc5f1e546a005e4a63b25609","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/arbitrum/tokens/0x76ce01f0ef25aa66cc5f1e546a005e4a63b25609"},"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x7d214438d0f27afccc23b3d1e1a53906ace5cfea","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x7d214438d0f27afccc23b3d1e1a53906ace5cfea"}}}
