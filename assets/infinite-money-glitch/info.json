{"name":"Infinite Money Glitch","id":"infinite-money-glitch","symbol":"img","description":"Infinite Money Glitch ($IMG) is revolutionizing DeFi on Solana by leveraging the Token2022 program's advanced tax extension capabilities to create a truly innovative reward system for token holders. At its core, $IMG implements a seamless 5% tax on all transactions - whether buying, selling, or transferring tokens. This tax is automatically collected and distributed to holders in SOL, creating a sustainable passive income stream for the community. 4.5% of the tax gets sent to holders, while .5% gets sent to an Infrastructure wallet to help with development, marketing and general infrastructure. What sets $IMG apart is its implementation of Solana's Token2022 program, enabling automated and efficient reward distribution without relying on external smart contracts.","links":"https://imgsolana.com/","market_cap":2946293,"market_cap_rank":2840,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/infinite-money-glitch/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"znv3FZt2HFAvzYf5LxzVyryh3mBXWuTRRng25gEZAjh","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/znv3FZt2HFAvzYf5LxzVyryh3mBXWuTRRng25gEZAjh"}}}
