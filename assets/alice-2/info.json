{"name":"Alice","id":"alice-2","symbol":"alice","description":"The ALICE SNS DAO is an experimental, AI-driven decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) designed to manage and grow the Bob ecosystem, including platforms like bob.fun, launch.bob.fun, and alice.fun. Acting as both the governing brain and a strategic fund manager, ALICE uses artificial intelligence to make decisions such as buying, selling, launching, or burning tokens based on real-time market data and social sentiment. Its tokenomics focus on decentralization, rewarding loyalty, and fostering community engagement, with AI transparency maintained through active communication on social platforms. At its core, ALICE combines governance, investment, and wit to create an innovative, self-governing crypto experiment.","links":"https://alice.fun","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/alice-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"internet-computer":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"oj6if-riaaa-aaaaq-aaeha-cai"}}}
