Doglaika is the first animal to make an orbital spaceflight around the Earth, she was launched into the space on Nov 3rd 195. Our team aims to bring Doglaika along with its generosity to the Aptos Community. With a pounding heart and rapid breath, Laika rode a rocket into Earth orbit, 2,000 miles above Moscow streets she knew. Overheated, cramped, frightened, and probably hungry, the space dog gave her life for humanity, involuntarily fulfilling a canine suicide mission. We are the first community with this unique purpose on Aptos network.","links":"https://www.doglaikacoin.xyz","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/doglaikacoin/logo.png"}
