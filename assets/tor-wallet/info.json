{"name":"Tor Wallet","id":"tor-wallet","symbol":"tor","description":"TorWallet - Artificial intelligence for audit trail and data security TorWallet is designed so users donâ€™t have to choose between their favorite cryptocurrencies and privacy coins. They can have both. They can hold any cryptocurrency and still be able to use it confidentially whenever they want. Privacy needs to be ubiquitous, inclusive, and accessible. Today, anyone can send BTC, ETH, and thousands of other cryptocurrencies to another party without going through a financial institution. For those who value privacy, these cryptocurrencies come with a big tradeoff. Transactions are recorded on public ledgers, displaying amounts involved, inscribing virtual identities of their senders and receivers. Given the choice, we strongly believe that very few people will willingly disclose their crypto financials to the entire world.","links":"https://torwallet.app","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/tor-wallet/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x35073ca7bac0c2edf58fb34a2cbc39ea2fbb7056"}}}
