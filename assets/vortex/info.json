{"name":"VORTEX","id":"vortex","symbol":"vrtx","description":"Setup a multi-chain DeFAI Agent in less than 5 minutes using the $VRTX Protocol with real-time deployment, customization and visual alerts. We've made all of this really easy by structuring everything in one single dApp. That is this website. VORTEX is built like a layered app. You will find from this overlay all the way to the small UI integrations that you can do everything on this website. Being multi-chain means that our Agents work on both SOL and ETH. To allow this they use a shared liquidity quote AMM system which basically makes even swapping ETH for SOL tokens possible. This way the Agents catch the best plays no matter what chain they are on.","links":"https://vortexprotocol.ai/","market_cap":12939.83,"market_cap_rank":9299,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/vortex/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x5c7cc28ff152c397dc2e17349661db67113d6ce3","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x5c7cc28ff152c397dc2e17349661db67113d6ce3"}}}
