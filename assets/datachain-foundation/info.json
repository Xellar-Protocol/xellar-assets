{"name":"DATACHAIN FOUNDATION","id":"datachain-foundation","symbol":"dc","description":"Launched in September 3, 2017 by BRAINCITIES LAB a software editor based in Paris, France, The Datachain Foundation is a distributed data management platform that enables developers to build decentralized networks of AI-augmented object and infrastructures like public lights or roads. Core component of our platform, the Datawallet is a blockchain-based digital vault facilitating the exchange, the tracking and the management of pre-structured critical data. It adds verifiability to the key Vs describing the characteristics of big data (Volume, Velocity, Variety, Variability, Veracity, Visualization, and Value). Augmenting Utility Tokens With Memory And Purpose. The DC Future Access Token is an intrinsic token enabling the verification and validation of digital transaction on the Datachain Decentralised Data Network. Tokens owners have the possibility to allocate the Decentralised Control mean of value generation to specific projects, ecosystems and community. The DC Future Acces Token ecosystems facilitate an exchange of goods and services between participants in the ecosystem. Concepts from matching theory, auction theory, monetary economics, allocation theory, network economics and game theory, are explored to design stronger incentives for participants, produce robust stable outcomes, reduce inefficient allocation and improve the efficiency of transactions within each ecosystem powered by the DC FAT.
