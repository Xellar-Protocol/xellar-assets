{"name":"Eneftor","id":"eneftor","symbol":"eftr","description":"What is Eneftor? Eneftor is a blockchain based project which aims to be the centralizer every enthusiast needs for minting collections, creating, buying and selling NFTs on the Elrond Network. Moreover, Eneftor comes with tools for generative collections and a NFT Artificial Intelligence generator. Because Eneftor is about humans, from humans and to humans, we want to dedicate a section of our platform to raise funds for charity causes via our NFT superheroes community, by creating and sustaining special collections and auctions. Eneftor is a universal platform and we thought about the community managers, so we came up with a solution in this area, too. The NFT community managers will have the ability to reach their people easily and fast, organize giveaways for the most active members and create special community events or fancy airdrops. Many communities may create special NFT collections for events and could handle the access verification process via Eneftor tools. We believe that keeping it simple and intuitive is always the best solution, so the Eneftor Ecosystem will bring together some of the most usual activities from the NFT zone. In our vision, as an Eneftor user, you can do everything you would need for interacting with NFTs in a single place, without the need of a development team: ● Create collections and NFTs using our creator tools ● Launch and manage your mintable collection ● Sell and buy directly or via auctions ● Contribute to the charity events from the crowdfunding section ● Reach and manage your community with ease ● Enter the golden zone of airdrops ● Invest in launchpad’s project or list your own NFT based project.","links":"https://eneftor.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/eneftor/logo.png","detail_platform":{"elrond":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"EFTR-315177"}}}
