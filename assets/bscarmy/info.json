{"name":"BscArmy","id":"bscarmy","symbol":"barmy","description":"Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is the most viable and efficient blockchain network nowadays, with multiple advantages regarding transaction speed, gas fee, flexibility, scalability, security, and real use cases. Since May 2021, there have been more than 10 million daily transactions on average on BSC, according to BscScan, and this record-breaking number far exceeds the number of daily transactions on the most dominant blockchain competition, Ethereum. Being in the same ecosystem as Binance, the worldâ€™s biggest crypto exchange, BSC has a clear competitive advantage in liquidity. In the future, BSC is likely to prevail in the decentralized economy with thousands of BUIDLers working around the clock to improve the ecosystem. BSC Army is the first DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) for social media industries on BSC, and a community-centered initiative that strives to promote the adoption of BSC and blockchain in general. This program is for those who are passionate about BSC, Binance, and BNB token (BSC's native token). By advocating for BSC as well as helping potential investors and projects to use BSC, members of BSC Army can receive passive incomes in BARMY token.","links":"https://bsc.army/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bscarmy/logo.png"}
