{"name":"Peak Token","id":"peak-token","symbol":"pktk","description":"Oath of Peak is a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) that uses blockchain technology to facilitate players' participation in the economic side of MMORPG gameplay. Set in an ancient world of mythology and legends, players take on the role of an adventurer exploring exquisitely rendered 3D lands where they can befriend pets, monsters and other like-minded adventurers. $PKTK is a utility token that can be exchanged with in-game Peak Tokens (gPKTK), which can purchase and be purchased with Shells. As a token created on the Polygon Chain, $PKTK and gPKTK act as the link between Oath of Peak and the larger Web3 ecosystem. - $PKTK, which is on-chain, can be exchanged with gPKTK, which is off-chain (in-game), at a 1 to 1 ratio - The value of $PKTK is reflected in the demand of Shells and exchanging $PKTK for gPKTK is the only way for players to top up in Oath of Peak - Inversely, players can, to a certain limit, exchange Shells to gPKTK and then to $PKTK as well. More details can be found in the Token Flow section - The exchange rate between $PKTK/gPKTK and Shells indicates the Shell's inflation rate. As the number of users increases, more Shells will be produced. The exchange rate will adjust accordingly to stabilize the value of $PKTK, preventing it from inflating. Thus, the in-game economy is shielded from large fluctuations occurring outside of the game by adjusting the exchange rate - Finally, there is also the Peak Token Shop where players can use gPKTK to purchase certain shop items directly","links":"https://yeehagames.com/game/oathofpeak/event","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/peak-token/logo.png"}
