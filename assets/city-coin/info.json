{"name":"City Coin","id":"city-coin","symbol":"city","description":"Bitcoin gave us digital money, a means of reliable and secure transfer of money to anyone, anywhere at any time. The next step forward is to expand the usage and the availability of services that build on crypto-currencies and blockchain technology, and applied those to cities, towns and its citizens. We want to make this technology available for everyone to use. And to do just that we are building the City Chain blockchain and the Smart City Platform. Blockchain-technology is not a magic bullet that can be applied to every exisiting computer system. That is why we are building the Smart City Platform on top of the City Chain, ensuring that we are utilizing the most optimal technology for the different services and experiences provided by City Chain and the Smart City Platform. Cities and citizens will be able to use the City Chain to improve how we communicate, socialize, trade and manage our assets (both physical and digital). In addition, it will be possible to reduce costs/overhead, and at the same time empowering us with all the tools we need to take the next step forward!","links":"https://city-chain.org","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/city-coin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
