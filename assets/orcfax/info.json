{"name":"Orcfax","id":"orcfax","symbol":"fact","description":"Orcfax is a decentralized oracle service that publishes data about real world events to the Cardano blockchain. Orcfax data is made available to on-chain smart contracts in Cardano's eUTXO native format using the Cardano Open Oracle Protocol (COOP). Orcfax archives standards-compliant audit logs for all its real world data collection and validation. These are available on the permissionless Arweave.org decentralized storage network or via our own “Fact Explorer” app. The oracle data published by Orcfax is marked up using fact checking vocabularies. This means it can be easily verified to be authentic and accurate, thereby making it more trustworthy and repurpose-able than standard oracles.","links":"https://orcfax.io/","market_cap":1484519,"market_cap_rank":2475,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/orcfax/logo.png","detail_platform":{"cardano":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"a3931691f5c4e65d01c429e473d0dd24c51afdb6daf88e632a6c1e51"}}}
