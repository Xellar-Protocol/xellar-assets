{"name":"SPLASH","id":"splash-2","symbol":"splash","description":"SPLASH is a decentralized token built on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), designed as a liquidity-first experiment that strategically connects to the token $DROP. The project explores the power of automated market makers (AMMs) and arbitrage bots by seeding deep liquidity across SPLASH/DROP and SPLASH/XRP pools. At launch, 60% of the SPLASH supply was injected into the DROP/SPLASH pool alongside DROP worth approximately $30,000. The pairing leverages automated arbitrage opportunities to generate buy pressure across both assets. Instead of following a conventional market-first approach with hype and promotion, SPLASH flips the model by prioritizing liquidity setup. The project aims to test how volume, visibility, and price action can be driven through market mechanics rather than manual trading. The core idea is that as DROP increases in value, arbitrage bots will buy SPLASH to balance the pools, creating a symbiotic relationship. This feedback loop benefits both tokens, helping to stabilize volatility while building stronger price floors. SPLASH serves as a live case study in how deep liquidity design can support price discovery, reduce volatility, and organically grow volume and visibility on-chain.","links":"https://linktr.ee/SplashXRPL","market_cap":196096,"market_cap_rank":6472,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/splash-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"xrp":{"decimal_place":0,"contract_address":"53504C4153480000000000000000000000000000.rwfGtVZKpPX6vb51xE5RGTgXkQ4W9wSUrz","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/xrpl/tokens/53504C4153480000000000000000000000000000.rwfGtVZKpPX6vb51xE5RGTgXkQ4W9wSUrz"}}}
