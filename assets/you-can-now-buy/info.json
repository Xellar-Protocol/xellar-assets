{"name":"you can now buy","id":"you-can-now-buy","symbol":"happiness","description":"Happiness is a state of well-being and contentment, driven by a mix of biological, psychological, and social factors. Biologically, it’s tied to neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin, released during rewarding experiences. Psychologically, it’s shaped by mindset—practices like gratitude or mindfulness can boost it. Socially, strong relationships and a sense of purpose are key drivers. Context matters too; what sparks joy for one person (say, a quiet night in) might bore another.","links":"https://happinesscoin.fun/","market_cap":142789,"market_cap_rank":6910,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/you-can-now-buy/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"BXtTxGMRygG7DxufDFVaGP1WdvxSscWN8VoQ2zLhpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/BXtTxGMRygG7DxufDFVaGP1WdvxSscWN8VoQ2zLhpump"}}}
