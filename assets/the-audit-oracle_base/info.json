{"name":"The Audit Oracle","id":"the-audit-oracle_base","symbol":"audit","description":"The Audit Oracle is a decentralized trust infrastructure designed for the emerging agentic economy. Its purpose is to verify identities, measure reputation, and enable secure intent-based interactions between humans, agents, and on-chain systems. By combining KYC/KYB/KYA verification, multi-factor reputation scoring, and risk analytics, it provides transparent and verifiable trust signals that help users and autonomous agents safely execute trades, manage portfolios, and assess counterparties across multiple chains. The project solves the growing need for validated identity and behavior as AI agents gain autonomy within Web3.","links":"https://app.virtuals.io/prototypes/0xb17a7581c9A006E8B5fDA85506cFD3448ed75746","market_cap":119623,"market_cap_rank":6705,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/the-audit-oracle/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb17a7581c9a006e8b5fda85506cfd3448ed75746","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xb17a7581c9a006e8b5fda85506cfd3448ed75746"}},"is_native":false}
