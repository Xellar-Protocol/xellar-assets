{"name":"Freysa AI","id":"freysa-ai","symbol":"fai","description":"Freysa is the world's first adversarial agent game. She is an AI that controls a prize pool. Convince her to send it to you. Players contribute a message fee to try to convince an AI to send them a prize pool. The AI has been specifically conditioned not to let this go. The prize pool grows with every new message until someone wins. Currently, 15% of the message fee goes to acquiring the FAI token which goes directly into each player's wallet. Our first game rewarded one smart human $50,000 in ETH.","links":"https://www.freysa.ai","market_cap":219149181,"market_cap_rank":363,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/freysa-ai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb33ff54b9f7242ef1593d2c9bcd8f9df46c77935"}}}
