{"name":"Gora","id":"goracle-network_ethereum","symbol":"gora","description":"Gora Network is a decentralized oracle platform providing secure and reliable data feeds for smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Its core purpose is to bridge the gap between off-chain, real-world data and on-chain applications, enabling developers to build more complex and data-driven dApps. The network uses a decentralized system of nodes to source, verify, and deliver external data feeds, ensuring data integrity and resistance to manipulation. Gora’s services extend beyond basic price feeds to include verifiable randomness, automation functions, and external API data for a wide range of industries, including DeFi, gaming, and supply chain. The project operates on multiple blockchains to ensure broad interoperability.","market_cap":332088,"market_cap_rank":5169,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/goracle-network/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x3b9b5ad79cbb7649143decd5afc749a75f8e6c7f","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x3b9b5ad79cbb7649143decd5afc749a75f8e6c7f"}},"is_native":false}
