{"name":"Lukas Token","id":"lukas-token_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"lukas","description":"LUKAS Token is an entertainment-based cryptocurrency that bridges the gap between artists and fans, allowing supporters to directly benefit from the success of the performers they love. Inspired by Aca Lukas, one of the biggest music icons in the Balkans, the project transforms concerts and live events into tokenized experiences with real economic impact. The concept is simple, our company organizes one major event every month, and all event profits are used in a flywheel model to buy back LUKAS Tokens from the market, creating sustainable demand and linking token value to real-world success. Aca Lukas has a massive following, performing in sold out stadiums of over 100,000 people, and his influence forms the foundation of this unique Web3 ecosystem. Token holders gain access to exclusive concert tickets, backstage experiences, limited NFTs, and fan-only digital content, while also benefiting from the continuous growth of the platform. The long-term vision of LUKAS Token is to become a global artist-fan platform, onboarding more musicians and performers from around the world who will continue the movement that Aca Lukas started. Each new artist brings their audience and events into the ecosystem, increasing exposure, volume, and token utility.","links":"https://lukastoken.com","market_cap":599899,"market_cap_rank":4356,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/lukas-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xbf49e86227ac588ca9898b48b4e9828cc2c77ea9","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xbf49e86227ac588ca9898b48b4e9828cc2c77ea9"}},"is_native":false}
