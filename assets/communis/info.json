{"name":"Communis","id":"communis","symbol":"com","description":"Communis is an ERC20 token on the Ethereum network that is distributed to Hex Stakers as an incentive to stake better. Anyone who has shares from an active stake can mint their own Communis. Not only is Communis minted based on the shares of your stakes but it is also done exclusively to long term stakers and to those who actually fulfill their staking commitment. Communis aims to run alongside Hex to instill positive staking habits in the community. Your influence in Communis is directly reflected from the number of Shares you have from your stakes and for how many days. Completely read-only. No wrapping stakes, No Encapsulating stakes. Mintable only to stakes whose ownership can be provably signed for. No admin keys and no additional Origin Address. No extra found-me-first bonuses.","links":"https://communis.app/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/communis/logo.png"}
