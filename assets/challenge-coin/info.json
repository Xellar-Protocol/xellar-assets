{"name":"Challenge Coin","id":"challenge-coin","symbol":"hero","description":"Challenge Coin (HERO) is dedicated to giving back to our heroes within the military, law enforcement, and first-responder communities via an interactive ecosystem, built by members within these same communities, to establish the ability for donations, fundraising campaigns, and other initiatives via blockchain technology. The projectâ€™s Dev Team is fully Doxxed and consists of several high-profile members of the military community, including highly decorated SEAL Team Members; which is critical in providing the necessary insight to effectively allocate funds, resources, and the ability utilize their public platforms to ensure the project's \"mission\" statement is a success. Challenge Coin specifically follows through by providing ETH reflections on ALL transactions; specifically with 2% being redistributed to ALL holders and 4% to the publicly notated HERO Charity Wallet (herocharitywallet.eth) for the Team to distribute amongst various charities and fundraising initiatives within these communities.","links":"https://thechallengecoin.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/challenge-coin/logo.png"}
