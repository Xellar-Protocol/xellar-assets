{"name":"Loop ETH","id":"loop-eth","symbol":"lpeth","description":"Loop is a dedicated lending market for Ethereum carry trades. Users can supply a long tail of Liquid Restaking derivatives (e.g., Pendle LP tokens) as collateral to borrow ETH for increased yield and points exposure. The interest charged to borrowers is distributed among ETH-lenders or lpETH stakers and dLP-lockers, thus rewarding high protocol-alignment that allows Loop to scale. - Lenders receive back a receipt token, lpETH, that can be used throughout DeFi or be staked to earn passive yield in ETH. - Loopers can borrow ETH against yielding LRT derivatives to perform carry trades for ETH-based yields. - dLP Lockers can lock the protocolâ€™s governance token, LOOP, into a Dynamic Liquidity (dLP) position to earn protocol revenue.","links":"https://www.loopfi.xyz","market_cap":1732416,"market_cap_rank":3331,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/loop-eth/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa684eaf215ad323452e2b2bf6f817d4aa5c116ab"}}}
