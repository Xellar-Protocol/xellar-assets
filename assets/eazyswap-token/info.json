{"name":"EazySwap Token","id":"eazyswap-token","symbol":"eazy","description":"EazySwap is a Decentralized Exchange with an Automated Market Maker (AMM), native to PulseChain. It is based on a dual token system, consisting of the native liquid EAZY and its escrowed version xEAZY, which is a non-transferable governance token - also known as Staked EAZY. Key Features on EazySwap - Secure Token Swapping with Lowest Fees - Liquidity Provision (earning rewards by providing LP) - Farming (earning rewards by staking LP in farm) - Protocol Profit Sharing (by allocating xEAZY in Profit Sharing Program) - Launchpad Participation (by allocating xEAZY in Launchpad Program) - Governance Voting (by allocating xEAZY in Governance Program) DEX with Future Once EazySwap reaches a mature stage and successfully attracts a significant amount of liquidity, majority of emissions will be distributed in xEAZY. This will provide a high level of control on the supply flow on the market. Initially, the majority of protocol earnings derived from swap fees will be allocated towards redistributing real yield to xEAZY token holders. A portion of these earnings will be utilized for buybacks and burns, ensuring a consistent buying pressure on EAZY tokens. This mechanism aims to provide continuous value appreciation and supports the long-term stability of the EazySwap ecosystem. Additional pros for bright future with EAZY - Capped Maximum supply - Strategically designed and pro-actively adjusted emissions - Deflationary Mechanism - Regular EAZY buybacks","links":"https://www.eazyswap.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/eazyswap-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"pulsechain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6cf99baa0a4d079f960216d08cf9a1bc7e4dd37c"}}}
