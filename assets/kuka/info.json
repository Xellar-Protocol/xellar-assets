It was launched with a renounced contract and locked liquidity to ensure long-term transparency and community trust. KŪKA positions itself as a symbolic return to simplicity and shared value—drawing from early crypto ideals of decentralization, anonymity, and collective momentum. The project is tax-free, community-driven, and focused on fostering organic participation without central control.","links":"https://www.kukatoken.io/","market_cap":824116,"market_cap_rank":3877,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kuka/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe9942930a2e3a8a096a8a9637d62219f3159cf4d","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xe9942930a2e3a8a096a8a9637d62219f3159cf4d"}}}
