{"name":"FluidAI","id":"fluid","symbol":"fld","description":"FluidAI makes tokenized market access more efficient for institutions, trading platforms, and retail investors by using predictive AI-based models to solve inefficiencies in digital asset markets. Unlike the equities, FX, or commodities markets, which have sophisticated liquidity infrastructures and settlement systems, crypto markets suffer from several problems arising from a lack of liquidity such as high volatility, large price slippages, vulnerability to market manipulation, and flash crashes. FluidAI is driven by technologists, academics, data scientists, institutional digital asset platform founders, and investment bankers whose experience spans across tier-one TradFi and crypto institutions such as Bank of America, HAYVN, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Jefferies, Bloomberg, Citigroup, Refinitiv, and leading data science academic institutions such as Imperial College London, and Blekinge Institute of Technology, Sweden. FluidAI is Liquidity Transformed.","links":"https://fluidai.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/fluid/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
