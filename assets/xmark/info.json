{"name":"xMARK","id":"xmark","symbol":"xmark","description":"Benchmark Protocol's xMARK token is issued similarly to a LP token in exchange for staking MARK tokens in the Standard, Benchmark Protocol's single asset staking model. xMARK is similar to a receipt in that you can exchange it back at anytime for the underlying MARK tokens. As MARK is a rebase token, the assets underlying the xMARK token will be affected by rebase; however, the number of xMARK tokens you own while staking, will never rebase. The exchange rate of xMARK to MARK tokens therefore will be dynamic","links":"https://benchmarkprotocol.finance","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/xmark/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x26a5dfab467d4f58fb266648cae769503cec9580"},"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x36b679bd64ed73dbfd88909cdcb892cb66bd4cbb"},"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xf153eff70dc0bf3b085134928daeea248d9b30d0"}}}
