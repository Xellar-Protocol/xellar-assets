{"name":"Nosey","id":"nosey_solana","symbol":"nosey","description":"Nosey is a community-driven memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. The token is inspired by the viral TikTok creator Citra, who is building a 10-foot tall animatronic robot. The project brings this character and lore into the crypto ecosystem, using Nosey as a cultural and meme-driven asset for the Solana community. Nosey has no centralized roadmap or utility promises, but functions as a cultural token that ties together social media virality and blockchain activity. The contract is deployed on Solana and trading is available on decentralized exchanges.","links":"https://x.com/i/communities/1958758241950650563","market_cap":14644.73,"market_cap_rank":10411,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nosey/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"GZcVdxXSenrKgnkAKCj9Yp7ConTB4poGfBohFVpupump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/GZcVdxXSenrKgnkAKCj9Yp7ConTB4poGfBohFVpupump"}},"is_native":false}
