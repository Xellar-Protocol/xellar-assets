{"name":"Unifund","id":"unifund","symbol":"ifund","description":"Unifund is a decentralized mutual fund protocol running on the Ethereum blockchain; it allows users to pool their assets under the administration of a Fund Manager (any Ethereum address). The best part about our protocol is that it allows all this mutual fund business to be conducted in a trustless, decentralized manner which removes part of the risk from fund members and onto Fund Managers.","links":"https://unifund.global/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/unifund/logo.png"}
