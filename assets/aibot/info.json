Aibot also has a multi-node infrastructure for redundancy and geographical optimization. History of your project. Aibot was founded in 2023 with the goal of bringing an ultra-fast trading bot on Telegram. The project has iterated through beta testing and feedback to refine the product. Recently, Aibot launched on Telegram to give public access to its high-speed trading tools. Whatâ€™s next for your project? Upcoming milestones include releasing their own AIBOT token, integrating advanced AI for auto-trading, expanding to other blockchains, and developing an iOS/Android app. The roadmap focuses on more features while improving speed and usability. What can your token be used for? The AIBOT token can be used to get a 50% fee discount on trading fees. Users need to hold 1000 AIBOT to unlock the lower fees. The token also allows holders to claim a portion of fees as rewards. In the future, more utility like governance may be added.","links":"https://aibot.app/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/aibot/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf1fb4cf949277adc3f89c0d6091100789033b7b5"}}}
