{"name":"AMAX Network","id":"amax-network","symbol":"amax","description":"To address growing user application needs, blockchain technology has evolved from distributed ledger, to smart contract technology that supports all sorts of application logic, through to providing layer-0 and layer-1 SDK technology that facilitates rapid building of new blockchains, and building layer-2 to solve problems that couldn't be solved with layer-1 technology, as well as bi-directional cross-chain technology. However, other than promoting security, reliability and decentralization, there hasn't to-date been a single blockchain technology that can sufficiently meet the following requirements: massively parallel processing modularized and extensible customizable and configurable Armonia's founding team believes it takes a multichain blockchain platform technology to achieve the above objectives, which can then service every individual and business user globally. It is also Armonia's founding team's belief that the to-be-built metaverse will be a truly decentralized, open and multi-chain universe which harbors users, assets, transactions and smart-contract based, mission-critical DApps.","links":"https://amax.network/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/amax-network/logo.png"}
