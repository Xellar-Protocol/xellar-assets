{"name":"Resolv RLP","id":"resolv-rlp","symbol":"rlp","description":"Resolv is a protocol that maintains USR, an overcollateralized stablecoin natively backed by Ether (ETH). USR achieves its peg by hedging its collateral pool and maintaining a tokenized insurance fund called RLP. Users can stake USR to obtain the yield-bearing version called stUSR. USR is minted by depositing liquid assets, such as USDC or USDT, on 1:1 value basis. When USR is redeemed, a user receives a 1:1 equivalent to the notional amount. RLP: ETH portfolio backs USR with a more than 100% ratio. Excess part of collateral acts as a backing for RLP - Resolv Liquidity Pool. Key features of RLP: RLP is designed to protect USR from market and counterparty risks. In exchange, RLP users receive higher portion of profits of the collateral pool. RLP has a price, representing value of ETH backing a single unit of RLP token; RLP price can vary. Collateral required for minting or redemption is based on the latest price;","links":"https://www.resolv.xyz/","market_cap":7331368,"market_cap_rank":1641,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/resolv-rlp/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x4956b52ae2ff65d74ca2d61207523288e4528f96"}}}
