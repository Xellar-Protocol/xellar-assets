{"name":"DIAM","id":"diam_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"diam","description":"Diamante is a Layer 1 network focused on quantum-proof security for everyday crypto use. It combines a modern proof-of-stake validator set with an execution layer designed for low latency finality and high throughput. The network uses post-quantum signature schemes alongside standard cryptography, plus an execution model built to process transactions in parallel where possible. Developers can deploy apps through a familiar toolchain, and users can move assets, run privacy-preserving connections, and interact with on-chain services. Diamante prioritizes quantum-proof primitives for keys and signatures, and integrates AI-assisted telemetry to optimize routing and performance across nodes. The design aims to keep consumer apps responsive while maintaining strong security assumptions. DIAM pays network fees, is staked by validators and delegators to secure the chain, and participates in on-chain governance for protocol upgrades. Supply, emissions, and validator details are documented in the project docs and explorer. Diamante is developed by Diamante with contributions from an open developer community. The network and code are open source and maintained in public repositories.","links":"https://www.diamante.io/","market_cap":18596958,"market_cap_rank":1155,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/diam/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x1fa0f5ed24a1a2b43741e88f8fec19633e67082b","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x1fa0f5ed24a1a2b43741e88f8fec19633e67082b"}},"is_native":false}
