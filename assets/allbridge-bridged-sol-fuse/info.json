{"name":"Allbridge Bridged SOL (Fuse)","id":"allbridge-bridged-sol-fuse","symbol":"assol","description":"Allbridge SOL (Fuse) is the bridged version of Solana (SOL) token on Fuse network bridged through Allbridge classic dapp. Solana is a Layer 1 blockchain that offers users fast speeds and affordable costs. It supports smart contracts and facilitates the creation of decentralized applications (dApps). Projects built on Solana include a variety of DeFi platforms as well as NFT marketplaces, where users can buy Solana-based NFT projects. Its high performance means Solana doesnâ€™t require a traditional scaling Layer 2 solution; instead, Layer 2s on Solana focus on interoperability and connecting Solana to other chains. Solana combines the Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus mechanism alongside the more common Proof-of-Stake. This ensures Solana achieves consensus more quickly while reducing the workload and solving the blockchain trilemma, where developers have to balance decentralization, security, and scalability.","links":"https://fuse.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/allbridge-bridged-sol-fuse/logo.png","detail_platform":{"fuse":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x5cb5249d420639619ffd637c79f0aa5c0a9fcd4b"}}}
