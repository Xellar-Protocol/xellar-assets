{"name":"2","id":"2-token_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"2","description":"In a crypto world overflowing with complex projects, technical whitepapers, and promises of revolutionary change, “2” arrives with no ambition other than to exist — and somehow, that’s exactly what makes it powerful. It’s a memecoin born from the chaos of the internet, from the collective realization that not every coin needs a purpose, and not every project needs to take itself seriously. “2” is the anti-hype coin that ironically creates hype. It’s the sequel nobody asked for, the follow-up to nothing, and the start of something we can’t explain — but we feel it. It’s not built on a mission to decentralize the banking system or revolutionize smart contracts. It’s not here to create a metaverse, save the environment, or provide cross-chain liquidity (whatever that means). It’s just 2 — and that’s more than enough. The beauty of “2” lies in its simplicity. It doesn’t pretend to be useful. It doesn’t need a roadmap filled with buzzwords or a whitepaper that sounds like it was written by AI on caffeine. It’s not trying to be the next Bitcoin or Ethereum. Instead, “2” is a coin that thrives on vibes, memes, and community. It exists because sometimes, existing is the meme. And in a world where everything is optimized and monetized, something meaningless starts to feel meaningful. The name “2” itself is part of the joke. Why “2”? Because “1” is too serious — it's the first, the original, the overachiever. “2” is the chill younger sibling who doesn’t care about winning, yet somehow becomes the favorite. And “3”? Tryhard. “2” hits that sweet spot of not being first, not being last, but being just enough to be remembered. It’s a coin that says: \"Hey, we’re not here to change the world. We’re just here to hang out.\" This is not a revolution. It’s a meme. It’s not a utility. It’s a vibe. “2” is for the people who bought Dogecoin before Elon tweeted. It’s for the degens, the lurkers, the meme lords, and the silent holders who watched serious projects crash and still had the energy to laugh. So what can you do with “2”? Absolutely nothing — and that’s the point. You can hold it, meme it, send it to your friends, lose it in your wallet, forget about it, then laugh about it six months later. You can create inside jokes, put it in your Twitter/X bio, or tell your grandkids you bought “2” before it was cool (or never cool, which is even funnier). In a sea of try-hard tokens and fake promises, “2” dares to be simple. It’s a memecoin that leans into absurdity, embraces the joke, and builds community through shared laughter, not shared spreadsheets. Because sometimes, being just 2 is better than trying to be #1.","links":"https://x.com/2before4bnb","market_cap":6555.44,"market_cap_rank":11965,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/2-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x977c4f40742daca3f1a4c11b44938fc12d714444","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x977c4f40742daca3f1a4c11b44938fc12d714444"}},"is_native":false}
