{"name":"Nostra","id":"nostra","symbol":"nos","description":"Nostra is your one-stop DeFi solution where you can lend, borrow and swap crypto. Integrating Nostra Money Market, UNO, and Nostra Swap creates the Nostra Liquidity Layer. We are enabling permissionless access to liquid crypto assets for users at any time for any purpose, with minimal impact on price. The core functions of the Liquidity Layer include: Lending: Users can deposit crypto for lending and earn interest Borrowing: Users can borrow crypto by using their deposits as collateral Minting: UNO is pegged to the USD and is overcollateralized by interest-bearing ETH deposited in the Nostra Money Market Swapping: Users will be able to seamlessly swap their stablecoins (including UNO) on Nostra Swap Nostra builds upon the foundations of well-established money markets (Compound, Aave, Euler Finance) while introducing new features that improve both capital efficiency and composability and takes into account the low gas fee environment of StarkNet. We have chosen to build Nostra on StarkNet because its underlying Validity proofs technology is ideal for building scalable and accessible DeFi products in a decentralized environment with fast finality times and cheap gas fees without compromising Ethereum's security. Further information regarding the role of NOS in the Nostra Liquidity Layer will be released in the coming months.","links":"https://nostra.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nostra/logo.png"}
