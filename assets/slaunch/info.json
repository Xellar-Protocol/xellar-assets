{"name":"Slaunch","id":"slaunch","symbol":"s","description":"Slaunch is the first launchpad powered by Initial Attention Offering (IAO), built natively on the Sui Network. It introduces a new launch primitive where early-stage projects can raise capital through community attention and participation. Unlike traditional IDOs, Slaunch rewards users for both attention and commitment. Through its dual system - Mindshare and Points - users gain access to launches by contributing on social platforms and participating on-chain with the $S token (hold, stake, trade). No VCs. No team allocation. 100% fairlaunch. Slaunch turns participation into power.","links":"https://slaunch.xyz/","market_cap":125257,"market_cap_rank":6313,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/slaunch/logo.png","detail_platform":{"sui":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0x80c204e59e0f55c7624210f04820c292a35176834756388397b47305cf2e7e1f::s::S","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/sui-network/tokens/0x80c204e59e0f55c7624210f04820c292a35176834756388397b47305cf2e7e1f::s::S"}}}
