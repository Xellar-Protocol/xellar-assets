{"name":"RUG RADIO","id":"rug-radio","symbol":"rug","description":"$RUG is the currency of exchange within the RugRadio ecosystem. $RUG is a pure utility token which means itâ€™s specifically designed to be used within the RugRadio ecosystem. It will also hold future exchange value within the RugNetwork on new projects developed by the DAO. Every Genesis NFT held will produce $RUG tokens. The longer that you hold your utility NFT, the more tokens you will receive. $RUG token works on a slow release cadence, meaning it will take 5 years for all the $RUG to be trading in the marketplace. Rug Radio is the first fully decentralized media platform. Rug Radio is platform agnostic, allowing our hosts to create using whichever medium they want. Hosts directly benefit from their creation and own the rights to what they create.","links":"https://www.rug.fm/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/rug-radio/logo.png"}
