The $XNK token is 100% reserve-backed by real physical gold stored in bankrupt-remote vaults that have been fully audited and which are compliant with all Japanese FSA regulations. Each $XNK will be worth 1 fine troy ounce of pure gold. As Daiichi Commodities adds more gold to the vault, more $XNK tokens will be issued for use in DeFi, Web3, and the entire crypto space.","links":"https://kinka-gold.com","market_cap":1642231,"market_cap_rank":3544,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kinka/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x722a89f1b925fe41883978219c2176aecc7d6699","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x722a89f1b925fe41883978219c2176aecc7d6699"},"cardano":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"2c5c6ca6f993e198bc9ac859ffb624dd291ec50b4d361544bd01e3ac","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/cardano/tokens/2c5c6ca6f993e198bc9ac859ffb624dd291ec50b4d361544bd01e3ac"}}}
