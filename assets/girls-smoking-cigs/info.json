{"name":"Girls Smoking Cigs","id":"girls-smoking-cigs","symbol":"gsc","description":"$GSC (Girls Smoking Cigs) represents a cultural shift in the memecoin space, challenging both crypto and societal norms. While the memecoin landscape has increasingly gravitated toward short-term speculation, $GSC draws inspiration from the original 'hodl' philosophy - but with a rebellious twist. The project transforms hodl's concept of 'conviction' into one of 'addiction,' playing on the irresistible nature of both cigarettes and cultural rebellion. The project emerged from recognizing a significant gap in crypto culture: the lack of authentic, non-objectified female representation in memecoins. $GSC captures the essence of feminine rebellion against societal double standards, particularly how women face disproportionate judgment for the same behaviors accepted in men - symbolized through the act of smoking. Beyond its satirical surface, $GSC taps into a powerful aesthetic and cultural movement, celebrating women who reject arbitrary social constraints. The project resonates with a global community of individuals who appreciate both the artistic appeal of the imagery and its deeper commentary on gender dynamics in both traditional and crypto spaces. While other 'female-themed' tokens often resort to objectification, $GSC stands apart by embodying genuine empowerment through defiance, making it uniquely positioned in both the memecoin space and broader cultural conversation.","links":"https://x.com/GirlsCigs","market_cap":15913.04,"market_cap_rank":9046,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/girls-smoking-cigs/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"B2Lfe3mjgszhieS9QbZHHDNcSdMcjigqp8GtJrc2pump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/B2Lfe3mjgszhieS9QbZHHDNcSdMcjigqp8GtJrc2pump"}}}
