{"name":"Potion Exchange","id":"potion-exchange","symbol":"ptn","description":"Potion is a meticulously designed initiative focused on establishing a dynamic framework for a synthetic asset marketplace within the Ethereum Network. The protocol's primary objective is to facilitate the synthesis of tokens on the ETH Network, encompassing assets that have yet to be introduced to the trading landscape. Operating on a partially collateralized model, Potion's unique design involves collateralization of its synths by both the underlying asset and Potion's native token. This innovative approach enhances the stability and reliability of the protocol, ensuring a secure foundation for users engaging in asset transactions within the Ethereum ecosystem. Potion introduces a distinctive approach to collateralization, combining the support of the underlying asset with the strength of Potion's proprietary token. This dual collateralization mechanism enhances the robustness of the protocol, providing users with a secure environment for asset transactions.","links":"https://www.potion.exchange/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/potion-exchange/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x276e84edc5bd94731b65c207dc1512fc5391572f"}}}
