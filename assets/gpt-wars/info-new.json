{"name":"GPT Wars","id":"gpt-wars","symbol":"gptw","description":"GPT Wars is an AAA-quality GameFi project built on the TON blockchain, leveraging Unreal Engine 5.4.3 to provide high-resolution graphics and immersive shooter gameplay. The game includes a unique Telegram Mini App, which functions as a Tap-to-Earn game to enhance engagement and serve as an in-app marketplace for assets like skins and loot boxes. The projectâ€™s deflationary token, $GPTW, is integrated into a sustainable in-game economy designed around USDT transactions, with token buybacks and burns contributing to its value maintenance. The game targets both Web2 and Web3 users, with streamlined onboarding via Telegram to minimize barriers to entry.","links":"https://gptwars.ai/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gpt-wars/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
