{"name":"Boson Protocol","id":"boson-protocol","symbol":"boson","description":"Boson Protocol is a trust minimised and cost minimised protocol that automates digital to physical redemptions using NFTs encoded with game theory. Boson Protocolâ€™s vision is to enable a decentralized commerce ecosystem by funding and accelerating the development of a stack of specialist applications to disrupt, unbundle and democratize commerce. What is needed is a way to execute commerce transactions trustlessly with minimized human intermediaries or arbitrators. Our core technology disrupts e-commerce platforms by tokenizing real-world products and services and commerce data within a liquid digital market, built on DeFi. We call this decentralized autonomous commerce.","links":"http://bosonprotocol.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/boson-protocol/logo.png"}
