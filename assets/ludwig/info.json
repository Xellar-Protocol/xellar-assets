{"name":"LUDWIG","id":"ludwig","symbol":"ludwig","description":"Ludwig On Sonic (LUDWIG) is your meme gateway to exploring Balancer technology on the Sonic network. The phrase \"High Speed, Perfect Beets\" highlights the Sonic network’s lightning-fast performance, while \"Beets\" refers to the DEX where our primary pools and liquidity are hosted. Ludwig brings you the nostalgic yet iconic Ludwig character, which has been the Beethoven X mascot since their launch in 2021, thanks to Vee’s artistry and their invitation to adapt their assets. LUDWIG leverages Balancer's technology by offering a 60/25/15 weighted pool paired with stS (the leading liquid staking solution on Sonic) and BEETS (the native token of the Beets). With a total supply of 25 million tokens, a team-managed multisig will oversee emissions and incentive models, delivering APR rewards to stakers and liquidity providers.","links":"https://ludwigonsonic.com/","market_cap":53399,"market_cap_rank":8411,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ludwig/logo.png","detail_platform":{"sonic":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe6cc4d855b4fd4a9d02f46b9adae4c5efb1764b5","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/sonic/tokens/0xe6cc4d855b4fd4a9d02f46b9adae4c5efb1764b5"}}}
