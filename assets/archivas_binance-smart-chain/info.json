{"name":"Archivas","id":"archivas_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"rchv","description":"Archivas ($RCHV) is a decentralized memory layer built on BNB Chain that transforms data storage into living memory through Proof of Intelligent Storage (PoIS). Instead of simply keeping files, Archivas verifies and rewards data that holds real meaning such as AI models, datasets, and knowledge that can be recalled and reused across the network. This makes Archivas more than just storage because it becomes the foundation for intelligent data that can live, evolve, and contribute to Web3 and AI systems. It is the first of its kind on BSC, bringing a new category to the chain that goes beyond traditional storage tokens. Archivas is built to connect the worlds of AI and decentralized infrastructure, giving value to meaningful data instead of rewarding random file storage. Every interaction with the network burns $RCHV, creating a sustainable and deflationary system where real usage drives token demand. Archivas represents the next generation of decentralized storage where data is not only stored but remembered and understood. It is a network designed for the AI age, built for developers, researchers, and communities that believe the future of intelligence should be open, verifiable, and permanent.","links":"https://archivas.ai/","market_cap":124040,"market_cap_rank":6660,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/archivas_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x44442271e6ca7336a29032838d70675680adc7df","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x44442271e6ca7336a29032838d70675680adc7df"}},"is_native":false}
