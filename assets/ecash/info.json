{"name":"eCash","id":"ecash","symbol":"xec","description":"eCash (XEC) is a Layer-1 digital cash network, developed by Bitcoin ABC. It was created on Nov 15th, 2020, and has since distinguished itself from its predecessors and other Bitcoin clients by integrating the breakthrough Avalanche consensus with its core proof-of-work (PoW) layer, extending its security and fundamental capabilities. This hybrid consensus integration gives it unique properties for a Bitcoin-like chain, such as interoperability, staking rewards, real-time processing, and an improved overall extensibility, which is hard to achieve in a completely trustless manner using only Nakamoto consensus. The development roadmap is set with three main goals: Scaling transaction throughput from ~100 tps to more than 5.000.000 tps Improving the payment experience with a less than 3 second transaction finality time Extending the protocol and establishing fork-free upgrade routines, allowing for more rapid, iterative development","links":"https://e.cash/","market_cap":382241778,"market_cap_rank":183,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ecash/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
