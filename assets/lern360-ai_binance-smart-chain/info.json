Through tokenized incentives and smart contracts, it ensures transparent, secure, and high-quality learning experiences for individuals and institutions alike. LERN360 takes these problems head-on. Our platform integrates blockchain-certified credentials, AI-powered adaptive learning, and a tokenized reward system to create a more inclusive, efficient, and transparent digital learning experience. With blockchain verifying every credential, and AI tailoring each learning journey, students receive personalized, trustworthy, and flexible education. LERN tokens fuel the platform. They are used to unlock access to courses, reward participation, content creation, and skill development. A well-designed tokenomics model ensures long-term value: a fixed supply of tokens (with spent tokens recycled and sold to LERN360 users), rising demand, and value appreciation to support scalable increase in the number of learners, make learning accessible without inflation.","links":"https://www.lern360.ai/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/lern360-ai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x61327929b3ea44c5ec503d44d71a6c0fa2cefb02","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x61327929b3ea44c5ec503d44d71a6c0fa2cefb02"}},"is_native":false}
