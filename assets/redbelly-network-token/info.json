{"name":"Redbelly Network","id":"redbelly-network-token","symbol":"rbnt","description":"Redbelly Network is the worldâ€™s first formally verified blockchain, developed at the University of Sydney in collaboration with CSIRO, the Australian National Science Agency. Patent #12093247 granted in the United States. Redbelly enables RWA asset issuers to tokenise and trade compliant on-chain structured products. Redbelly Network integrates full user identity and accountability at the transaction layer, protecting user PII with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) and verifiable credentials. This ensures proper licensing, jurisdiction compliance, and eliminates the need for repetitive KYC processes. Compliance is automatically enforced and customizable by asset class and jurisdiction, removing the need for offline registries and paper-based checks. Redbelly enables asset issuers to build digital registries, creating a single source of truth for entire asset classes on-chain and facilitating the creation of new structured financial products from tokenized assets. We work with challenger-brand asset issuers who have established network effects and assets, reducing issuer risk by promoting accountability and ensuring clean liquidity by default.","links":"https://www.redbelly.network/","market_cap":355450191,"market_cap_rank":258,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/redbelly-network-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
