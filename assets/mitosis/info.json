{"name":"Mitosis","id":"mitosis","symbol":"mito","description":"Mitosis introduces a protocol that transforms DeFi liquidity positions into programmable components while solving fundamental market inefficiencies. In current DeFi systems, when users provide liquidity to protocols, they encounter two significant limitations. First, their positions become static and illiquid - once assets are committed, they can’t be effectively used elsewhere. Second, the most profitable opportunities remain exclusive to large investors who can negotiate private agreements, creating an uneven playing field that mirrors traditional finance systems.","links":"https://mitosis.org/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mitosis/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8e1e6bf7e13c400269987b65ab2b5724b016caef","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x8e1e6bf7e13c400269987b65ab2b5724b016caef"}}}
