{"name":"Module","id":"module","symbol":"module","description":"MODULE introduces a new experimental framework for tokenized intelligence and intelligent liquidity: Composable Multi-Agent System Tokens, powered by a novel token standard and execution primitive called ERC-AI. Each MODULE token represents a fully autonomous, programmable AI agent that is composable with other agents to form powerful onchain swarms. By combining the fungibility of ERC-20 and the identity of ERC-721with the logic of ERC-6551, ERC-AI enables a modular swarm of intelligent agents that an reason, act, and evolve together.","links":"https://module.tech/","market_cap":81967,"market_cap_rank":6900,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/module/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb01b6a7ef8560017aa59a990e39f26b8df29f80f","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xb01b6a7ef8560017aa59a990e39f26b8df29f80f"}}}
