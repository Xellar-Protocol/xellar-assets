{"name":"Sanke Wallet","id":"sanke-wallet_ethereum","symbol":"sanke","description":"Sanke Wallet is a privacy-first browser extension built on Kohaku, the privacy and security framework founded by Vitalik Buterin, Nicolas Liochon, and contributors from the Ethereum Foundation. Our goal is simple: bring trustless, private, locally-verified wallet flows to everyday users — without relying on centralized RPCs or data-leaking intermediaries. Today, most wallets expose far more than users realize: your identity, on-chain patterns, app connections, IP metadata, and even how you move funds. Privacy is not lost in one action — it leaks piece by piece, until anyone can reconstruct a full profile of who you are. Sanke was built to reverse this trend.","links":"https://www.sanke.app/","market_cap":11095.34,"market_cap_rank":10954,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/sanke-wallet_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x72943fb986c7cc044740ff7bbf4ec722cd7d5436","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x72943fb986c7cc044740ff7bbf4ec722cd7d5436"}},"is_native":false}
