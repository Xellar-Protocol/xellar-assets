{"name":"Morphex","id":"mpx","symbol":"mpx","description":"Morphex is an emerging decentralized exchange offering spot and perpetual futures trading while requiring only a wallet connection to use. All trades are settled against the Morphex Liquidity Pool (“MLP”), where a user would be able to provide liquidity with any whitelisted asset, and in exchange, they would receive MLP tokens, representing their share in the diversified liquidity pool. Morphex provides low transaction fees, eliminates price impact and provides protection against \"scam wick\" liquidations, while enabling traders to retain full control of their assets. The pricing of the protocol will be established through an average of prices from top centralized exchanges in combination with Chainlink oracles. Over time, the protocol's governance will have a greater influence over key parameters, such as liquidity incentives for specific MLP pools in the future.","links":"https://www.morphex.trade/","market_cap":958495,"market_cap_rank":3980,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mpx/logo.png","detail_platform":{"fantom":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x66eed5ff1701e6ed8470dc391f05e27b1d0657eb"},"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x94c6b279b5df54b335ae51866d6e2a56bf5ef9b7"}}}
