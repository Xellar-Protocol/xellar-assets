{"name":"Atto","id":"atto","symbol":"atto","description":"Atto is a Layer-1 cryptocurrency designed to function as fast, feeless digital cash for everyday payments of any size, including true micropayments. The purpose is to let people, apps, and devices move value peer-to-peer with sub-second confirmation and zero transaction fees, so even very small transfers remain practical while larger checkouts stay predictable and low-friction. Atto focuses on payment utility over general computation: send, receive, and settle quickly, without fee markets or variable costs complicating pricing. This enables use cases like retail checkout, online subscriptions, per-request APIs, content tipping, and machine-to-machine payments, while giving developers a simple, reliable payment rail that behaves consistently under load.","links":"https://atto.cash/","market_cap":113466,"market_cap_rank":7271,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/atto/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":null}}}
