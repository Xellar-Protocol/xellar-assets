{"name":"Jiyuu","id":"jiyuu","symbol":"jiyuu","description":"Jiyuu, the Japanese word for freedom, reminds us of the importance of breaking free from societal constraints and living true to ourselves, just like the mighty eagle soaring through the sky. Jiyuuâ€™s tax structure is a defining characteristic that sets it apart from other coins in the market. With a limited total supply of 1 million, Jiyuu offers holders the benefit of a 0% tax on purchases, providing a significant cost efficiency when acquiring the coin. However, in the event of profit being made, Jiyuu imposes a 30% tax exclusively on the profit earned, ensuring that holders of Jiyuu are not subject to any taxes on their transactions or holdings as long as they are not making a profit or at a loss. This structure is designed to provide a balance between promoting the coins adoption and protecting the coins value. This tax structure rewards long-term holders, as it taxes only on profit and not on transactions or holdings, providing an additional layer of residual income freedom. This tax structure is a rare feature in the crypto space, it makes Jiyuu an attractive option for traders and investors who value the ability to earn residual income with fewer restrictions and regulations.","links":"https://www.jiyuucoin.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/jiyuu/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x77d9046ee15faaceb89439ffdde4be071c2f07bd"}}}
