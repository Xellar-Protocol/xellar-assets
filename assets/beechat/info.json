{"name":"BeeChat","id":"beechat","symbol":"chat","description":"BeeChat is a decentralized application that runs under the protocol framework provided by OpenChat. BeeChat uses financial incentives to bring other digital services and applications into the decentralized OpenChat ecosystem in the form of communications & wallets. The OpenChat Reward Engine will provide ChatCoin as a natural incentive for digital service providers. In addition to ensuring common ethics and legitimacy of content and transactions, the ecosystem does not impose any unnecessary restrictions or charges on monetization strategies, which in turn encourages new partners to join the initiative. BeeChat now has hundreds of millions of users around the world, and BeeChat is committed to providing full support for the development of OpenChat, and OpenChat will continue to conduct a full range of decentralized research using BeeChat's support.","links":"http://www.beechat.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/beechat/logo.png"}
