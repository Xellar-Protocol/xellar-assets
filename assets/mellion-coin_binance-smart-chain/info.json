{"name":"Mellion Coin","id":"mellion-coin_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"mec","description":"Mellion Coin (MEC) is the core token of the BitNest ecosystem, launched in 2025 and built on the BNB Smart Chain (BEP20). It serves as a functional digital asset that powers BitNest’s decentralized savings, leasing, lending, cross-chain, and governance systems. The total supply of MEC is 300 million tokens, with a fixed and deflationary model designed to ensure long-term scarcity and sustainable value growth. The token economy of MEC follows a “fixed supply + behavior-based release + multi-dimensional burn + lock-up mechanism” model. BitNest allocates 30% of MIX Chain’s quarterly net profits to buy back MEC from the open market and permanently burn those tokens. This ongoing deflation mechanism gradually reduces circulating supply while supporting token value stability and user confidence. Token allocation structure: 45% – Liquidity incentives (LP mining): rewards for decentralized liquidity providers and yield contributors. 35% – DAO node sales: supports BitNest’s decentralized governance and community dividend model. 10% – BitNest Loop airdrop: distributed to early ecosystem participants and verified contributors. 6.5% – Technical team incentives: released gradually under time-lock for transparency. 3.5% – Ecosystem development fund: used for partnerships, marketing, and product expansion. In the BitNest ecosystem, MEC is used for multiple core functions: As the primary token of BitNest Savings, users can stake or deposit MEC to earn algorithmically managed on-chain yields. Acts as collateral within BitNest’s lending protocol, enabling borrowing and credit-based liquidity. Serves as the transaction and settlement token within the Lease platform and BNC cross-chain bridge. Provides governance power within the BitNest DAO for proposals, voting, and reward distribution. Integrated into transaction-fee burning, strengthening the token’s deflationary loop. BitNest aims to establish MEC as a key on-chain medium that links decentralized finance (DeFi) with real-world applications. Future expansion plans include cross-chain payments, asset custody, and micro-payment integration, allowing MEC to function as a foundational layer for multi-chain liquidity and value settlement. With its transparent tokenomics, deflationary model, and utility-driven ecosystem, MEC combines the use-value of a working asset with the governance rights of a decentralized economy. It forms a closed-loop system where “usage leads to consumption, and transactions feed back into value,” ensuring long-term growth and active community participation. BitNest continues to focus on sustainable token circulation, long-term ecosystem growth, and global compliance development, positioning MEC as a key financial instrument bridging digital and real-world economies.","links":"https://mellion.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mellion-coin_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x9a79d9c9e521cb900d2584c74bb41997eb7bf49f","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x9a79d9c9e521cb900d2584c74bb41997eb7bf49f"}},"is_native":false}
