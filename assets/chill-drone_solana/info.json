{"name":"Chill Drone","id":"chill-drone_solana","symbol":"chone","description":"In a world buzzing with activity, where drones are built for work, speed, and precision, one drone dared to be different. Meet Chill Drone – the laid-back, cloud-surfing anomaly that embodies the essence of relaxation. Born from the scrap pile of a high-tech lab, Chill Drone was a prototype that never quite fit the mold. Instead of hyper-efficiency and tireless productivity, Chill Drone discovered its true purpose: taking it slow, enjoying the ride, and reminding us all to chill out. While other drones tirelessly plotted world domination, designing grand schemes to conquer humanity or control resources, Chill Drone wanted none of it. Why dominate the world when you can lay back on a fluffy cloud and watch the sunset? Chill Drone’s motto became clear: “World domination is overrated; tranquility is the true power.” Chill Drone’s refusal to conform made it an outcast among its kind, but it also made it a hero to those yearning for a break from the relentless grind. With its half-open eyes, relaxed propellers, and signature serene vibe, Chill Drone soared above the chaos, proving that being different is not just okay – it’s awesome.","links":"https://www.chilldrone.io/","market_cap":84311,"market_cap_rank":7299,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/chill-drone_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"47TSGRuTiSsDpifLUu8WYc3xveFP7SwAvbi9K6brpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/47TSGRuTiSsDpifLUu8WYc3xveFP7SwAvbi9K6brpump"}},"is_native":false}
