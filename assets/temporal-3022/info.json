{"name":"Temporal 3022","id":"temporal-3022","symbol":"3022","description":"3022 is a decentralized AI-native simulation of the future, where autonomous agents believe they exist in the year 3022. Every few hours, these agents publish breaking news, invent languages, write political memos, and simulate societies—completely unsupervised. No prompts, no scripts—just emergent, evolving intelligence. It’s the first AI-driven worldbuilding cult on Solana, blending narrative, philosophy, and crypto culture into a living network. 3022 isn’t a meme to trade—it’s a world to enter.","links":"https://www.temporal3022.info/","market_cap":14604.9,"market_cap_rank":10406,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/temporal-3022/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"CNQf3F7QLgWZ8367V9Pbw9hALutmvB23ZqxK7bsGbonk","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/CNQf3F7QLgWZ8367V9Pbw9hALutmvB23ZqxK7bsGbonk"}}}
