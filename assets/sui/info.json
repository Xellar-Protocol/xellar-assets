{"name":"Sui","id":"sui","symbol":"sui","description":"Sui is a layer-1 blockchain optimizing for low-latency blockchain transfers. Its focus on instant transaction finality and high-speed transaction throughput make Sui a suitable platform for on-chain use cases like games, finance, and other real-time applications. Sui’s smart contracts are written in Move, a Rust-based programming language that prioritizes fast and secure transaction executions. Sui’s “horizontal scaling” is achieved through a process called “transaction parallelization,” allowing “parallel agreement” across different, independent types of transactions. Thanks to the organization of data as independent objects, transactions that are independent of one another are validated by Sui nodes via byzantine fault-tolerant proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.","links":"https://sui.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/sui/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
