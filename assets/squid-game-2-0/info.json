{"name":"Squid Game 2.0","id":"squid-game-2-0","symbol":"squid2","description":"What is the project about? Squid2.0 is a real Squid Game. The tax wallet and the bot are the casualties. Both wallets have been blacklisted, and the contracts have been renounced. The private key of the tax wallet has been publicly disclosed. Squid's founder made significant mistakes in the past, resulting in the disintegration of the Squid community. The community regained its spirit with the assistance of influential figures in the blockchain space. Squid2.0 learned from Squid's lessons, transforming into a fully community-driven project. 100% of the tokens were injected into the liquidity pool and locked for the long term. What makes your project unique? What sets SQUID2 apart is its emphasis on community-driven participation and engagement. We believe in the power of collective decision-making and actively involve our community in shaping the direction of the project. Additionally, our integration of entertaining and interactive features, inspired by the Squid Game, adds a distinctive and enjoyable element to the crypto landscape. History of your project.
