{"name":"The Space","id":"the-space","symbol":"space","description":"The Space is the worldâ€™s first NFT pixel art co-creation canvas where anyone can tokenize and trade pixels under Harberger Tax and Universal Basic Income (UBI). It is large-scale blockchain experiment that brings together NFT pixel art, Radical Markets principles, co-creation pixel map, and DAO. It is developed by Matters Lab (https://matters-lab.io/) One of the core components of The Space is decentralization and self-sustainability. The Space will be managed and operated by SpaceDAO, which will gradually take over the ownership and governance of The Space. SpaceDAO will decide on economic parameters such as the Harberger Tax rate, UBI ratio, canvas size, as well as the use of the Community Treasury. $SPACE is a standard ERC-20 token that people can get by claiming Airdrop or Fairdrop, completing community publishing tasks, or by buying directly from a Decentralized Exchange (DEX). $SPACE will be used to support the economic activities in The Space such as buying and selling pixels, paying tax, receiving UBI, as well as supporting the operation of SpaceDAO.","links":"https://thespace.game/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/the-space/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x264808855b0a6a5a318d238c6ee9f299179f27fc"}}}
