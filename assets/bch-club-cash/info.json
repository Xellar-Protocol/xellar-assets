CASH is focused on stimulating innovation and widening the scope of what's possible on the BCH network. As a community-driven initiative, CASH aims to be the sandbox for emerging decentralized applications. Through these initiatives, CASH seeks to not only demonstrate the capabilities of BCH beyond peer-to-peer transactions but also to catalyze community-led development. The ultimate goal is to further integrate CASH into the BCH ecosystem, making it a hub for developers and a showcase for the new CRC20 protocol. What can your token be used for? CASH can be used for a variety of functions within the BCH ecosystem. The fungible aspect of CASH is aimed at general transactions, remittances, and settlements. This allows for a myriad of use-cases, including but not limited to Defi.","links":"https://www.bchclub.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bch-club-cash/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
