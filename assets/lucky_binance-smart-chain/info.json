{"name":"LUCKY","id":"lucky_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"lucky","description":"B-Lucky is a decentralized lottery platform built on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC), designed to revolutionize the way people experience online gaming and rewards in the Web3 era. Unlike traditional lottery systems that rely on centralized authorities and opaque mechanisms, B-Lucky leverages blockchain technology and smart contracts to provide users with a fully transparent, provably fair, and trustless lottery experience. At the heart of B-Lucky’s ecosystem lies a set of carefully audited smart contracts that handle every aspect of the game. From ticket purchases and prize pool management to random number generation and automated payouts. Every draw is recorded on the blockchain, allowing anyone to verify results independently in real time. Participants can enter lotteries using BNB, and each ticket purchased contributes to the growing prize pool. When the draw takes place, a random winner is selected through a verifiable on-chain randomization process, ensuring that every participant has an equal and fair chance of winning. Winners receive their prizes instantly and directly into their wallets, eliminating delays and ensuring complete financial autonomy. Beyond just lotteries, B-Lucky aims to create a community-driven ecosystem where players, token holders, and developers can all benefit. Holders of the native B-LUCKY token may gain access to exclusive draws, staking rewards, governance rights, and referral bonuses. Security and transparency are core pillars of the B-Lucky platform. Regular audits by reputable third-party firms verified the security of the contracts. The use of decentralized technologies minimizes risks associated with fraud or manipulation, fostering a new level of trust between the platform and its community. In essence, B-Lucky is more than just a lottery, it represents a next-generation decentralized entertainment platform that merges gaming, blockchain innovation, and community empowerment. With its focus on fairness, accessibility, and sustainability, B-Lucky is paving the way for the future of decentralized gaming and digital rewards.","links":"https://b-lucky.gg","market_cap":6038153,"market_cap_rank":1934,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/lucky/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x67b47971426bb2180453b3993ff2ec319e704444","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x67b47971426bb2180453b3993ff2ec319e704444"}},"is_native":false}
