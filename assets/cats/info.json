{"name":"Cats","id":"cats","symbol":"cats","description":"#What is CATS about? CATS is a charity based meme token on the Arbitrum network #What makes our project unique? The first CAT based token with charity NFT ownership #History of our project. It all started with a curious cat named Whiskers. Whiskers was always fascinated by the world of technology and one day, he stumbled upon the world of crypto and blockchain. Whiskers was amazed by the potential of this new technology and how it could be used to create new and innovative solutions. One day, Whiskers was talking to a group of cat owners about his newfound love for crypto and blockchain. They were equally amazed by the potential of this technology and together, they envisioned a world where cats and their owners could connect, transact, and share information through the power of crypto. This is where the idea for Cats Token was born. A token that would represent ownership in a community of cat lovers and owners. #Whatâ€™s next for our project? An NFT / Charity partnership integration #What can our token be used for? Charitable donations and trading","links":"https://www.catscatscats.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cats/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xb1cd1d319f5363ed57fce58a85055ada0e15a957"}}}
