So, many different professionals like mechanics, cleaners, plumbers, electricians, doctors, nurses, engineers, designers, software programmers, architects, tutors and so many more professions can use it to earn a living full-time or part-time. Also, the developers plan to divide the store into a hard store and a soft store. As a result, clients could buy and sell tangible and intangible goods from one another. The YOU is a BEP20 (BSC) token serving as an integral part of the Youwho’s system. So, the team plans to reward early adopters and testers. Moreover, users will be able to claim a share of the platform’s fees. Also, token-holders can vote inside the DAO and participate in the arbitration to solve buyer-seller disputes. Besides, the management aims to provide $YOU with a bridge among BSC, Avalanche, Polygon, and Ethereum blockchains.","links":"https://why.youwho.io/","market_cap":380672,"market_cap_rank":3242,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/youwho/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb583961e033dfe0fff161952f7ba21c411b6103d"},"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x2fac624899a844e0628bfdcc70efcd25f6e90b95"},"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb92ba0a6a843379499770de82aa936d6ba0fd8ca"}}}
