{"name":"LabraCoin","id":"labracoin","symbol":"labra","description":"Labra is a deflationary meme token. Every holder is staking automatically. The staking reward comes from transactions. 1% of every transaction goes to holders and 1% of every transaction gets burned immediately. The goal is to have a true competitor for Doge but smarter. Incentivizing holders and burning 1% on every transaction makes it more fun. There is a serious team behind Labra and 70% of the maximum supply has already been burned. Labra is short for ''Labrador Retriever''. Which is the most popular dog in the whole world. The ticker that is being used is $LABRA. So it easily recognizable. All initial liquidity has been locked and 70% of the maximum supply is burned. The maximum supply is 1,000,000,000,000,000.
