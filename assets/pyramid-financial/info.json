{"name":"Pyramid Financial","id":"pyramid-financial","symbol":"pyra","description":"Pyramid Financial’s vision with $PYRA is positioned as a defiant challenge to what it views as the overly restrained and idealistic norms of decentralized finance (DeFi). Framing the current state of DeFi as a product of “sustainable” limitations, Pyramid Financial proposes a system that abandons the ideals of equity and democratization. Instead, it offers a model aimed at users who seek to dominate, not just participate. In this ecosystem, $PYRA is more than just a token—it’s presented as a symbol of power and resilience, crafted for those who reject modern DeFi’s “grain-fed” structure, which Pyramid sees as bound by restrictive values. Pyramid Financial’s ethos is that true wealth creation favors the bold and competitive, not those waiting for “egalitarian” returns. By advocating for a system where only the strong and assertive succeed, it emphasizes the notion that this new economic frontier is not for everyone—especially not for those unwilling to embrace risk and ambition. In essence, Pyramid Financial invites participants who are unafraid to strive for dominance and financial strength. Those who lack this aggressive mindset, it suggests, will ultimately be left behind. This philosophy doesn’t cater to universal success but promises substantial rewards to those who are willing to claim their space in a competitive, merit-driven economic framework.","links":"https://pyramid.lgbt/","market_cap":189076,"market_cap_rank":5536,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pyramid-financial/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x77777bf11ab5b96753ea48e0401667a70675841e"}}}
