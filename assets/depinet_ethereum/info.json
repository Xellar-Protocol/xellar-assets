Unlike conventional platforms that rely on centralized servers and intermediaries, DEPINET leverages decentralized technologies—such as distributed networks, encryption, and blockchain—to ensure that no single entity can monitor, censor, or exploit your online activities. At its core, DEPINET aims to reshape the way people interact with the internet by prioritizing individual sovereignty over data and identity. By offering a suite of products—including a decentralized VPN (dVPN), a privacy-focused browser (dBrowser), private file storage, a secure wallet, and a scalable blockchain—DEPINET delivers a holistic, user-centric environment. This ecosystem eliminates reliance on centralized control, putting you, the user, back in charge of your data, your browsing experience, and your digital assets.","links":"https://depinet.app/","market_cap":6720.15,"market_cap_rank":11912,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/depinet/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x28e58ee9932697f610de907a279684d30c407ba9","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x28e58ee9932697f610de907a279684d30c407ba9"}},"is_native":false}
