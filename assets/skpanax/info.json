{"name":"SKPANAX","id":"skpanax","symbol":"skx","description":"Community-based reward membership service Various cashback and point services have been released in the past, but there are disadvantages that only some consumers can use or must be used only on that platform. In addition, since the points paid at the time of purchase by consumers are around 0.5%, and in order to actually use them, it is difficult for consumers to use them easily. SKX has a vision to grow into a world-class bio company that realizes the value of improving human health and welfare by researching and developing products using Korean hwangchil tree, a native species of Korea. Many people in Korea as well as abroad are using S&PanaX products, and we provide 3% of the consumer price of all products as a reward when purchasing. In addition, in order to return 20% of net profit from sales to society, we plan to revitalize the SKX token ecosystem by making additional monthly deposits to the account dedicated to SKX, Vietnam's official virtual asset exchange.","links":"https://skxnow.xyz/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/skpanax/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
