{"name":"Presearch","id":"presearch_base","symbol":"pre","description":"Presearch is an open, decentralized search engine that rewards community members with Presearch Tokens for their usage, contribution to, and promotion of the platform. In a world where one company controls 77% of all searches, influencing trillions of dollars in spending, shaping perceptions and effectively acting as the primary gatekeeper to the Internet, a new, open and community-driven search engine is a necessity. Presearch has an innovative go-to-market strategy to target the most frequent searchers - web workers - and gain early adoption, on our way to releasing future versions of the open source platform that will utilize a blockchain-based index, curated by the community.","links":"https://www.presearch.io/","market_cap":3724084,"market_cap_rank":2334,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/presearch/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x3816dd4bd44c8830c2fa020a5605bac72fa3de7a","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x3816dd4bd44c8830c2fa020a5605bac72fa3de7a"}},"is_native":false}
