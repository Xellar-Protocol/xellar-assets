{"name":"Wrapped Avalanche (Universal)","id":"wrapped-avalanche-universal_base","symbol":"uavax","description":"uAVAX is a wrapped implementation of AVAX designed to enable trading and DeFi integrations across multiple blockchains. Avalanche is a layer one blockchain that functions as a platform for decentralized applications and custom blockchain networks. The Avalanche network consists of three individual blockchains: the X-Chain, C-Chain and P-Chain. Each chain has a distinct purpose, which is radically different from the approach Bitcoin and Ethereum use, namely having all nodes validate all transactions. Avalanche blockchains even use different consensus mechanisms based on their use cases.","links":"https://www.universal.xyz/tokens/uAVAX","market_cap":39261,"market_cap_rank":8584,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wrapped-avalanche-universal/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd6a34b430c05ac78c24985f8abee2616bc1788cb","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xd6a34b430c05ac78c24985f8abee2616bc1788cb"}},"is_native":false}
