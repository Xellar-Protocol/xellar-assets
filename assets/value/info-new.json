{"name":"Value","id":"value","symbol":"valu","description":"Value is the decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator and swap router protocol, which settles transactions for low price slippage impact. It finds the most accountable trade for the underlying swap transaction by fetching hundreds of assets markets. With finding the best route, Value sends transactions through the most secure and efficient way to decentralized exchanges. To carry out the best trade, Value can split it into multiple transactions and execute it all subsequently to minimize slippage impact. It also helps avoid transaction sandwiching between MEV bots.","links":"https://valu.so","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/value/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6d5e345796f6fc568798aac6e8704e736cc1bf2b"}}}
