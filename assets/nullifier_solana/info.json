{"name":"nullifier","id":"nullifier_solana","symbol":"null","description":"Nullifier.cash is a privacy-preserving transaction mixer on Solana that uses zero-knowledge proofs (zkSNARKs) to break the link between deposit and withdrawal addresses. Users can deposit SOL and withdraw to fresh addresses after a time delay, providing transaction privacy while maintaining the security and speed of the Solana blockchain. The protocol uses Groth16 zkSNARK verification, SHA256-based cryptographic commitments, and Poseidon hash functions for Merkle tree proofs to ensure maximum privacy.","links":"https://www.nullifier.cash/","market_cap":3197.62,"market_cap_rank":12880,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nullifier_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"D2jtkGU93qikXr2dpftsStLs3EXEZy62ww4VQpM7pump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/D2jtkGU93qikXr2dpftsStLs3EXEZy62ww4VQpM7pump"}},"is_native":false}
