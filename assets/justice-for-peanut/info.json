{"name":"JUSTICE FOR PEANUT","id":"justice-for-peanut","symbol":"jfp","description":"Welcome to the movement of justice for pnut and Fred, the only official coin that is backed by the owner of Pnuts freedom farm. This coin is the heartbeat of Pnut's Freedom Farm Animal Sanctuary, a haven for dozens of rescued horses, cats, and raccoons. It embodies founder Mark Longo's profound vision - more than a financial instrument, but a living commitment to those who cannot speak for themselves. Through this project, Fred and Peanut are raising awareness and hope, transforming each transaction into a promise of continued rescue and care. This isn't just a meme coin - it's a movement declaring that every life matters, and that rescue is an act of pure love. This isn't just a meme coin. It's a movement. It's a declaration that every life matters, that rescue is an act of love, and that together, we can create sanctuaries of hope, one rescued animal at a time.","links":"https://www.justiceforpnut.io/","market_cap":3190138,"market_cap_rank":2776,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/justice-for-peanut/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"CHKzK9EbEDxaQx1aU3SrRixJPFsToURcug5uUG2ipump"}}}
