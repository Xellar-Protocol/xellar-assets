{"name":"Immortal Token","id":"immortal-token_immutable","symbol":"imt","description":"Immortal Rising 2 is a dark fantasy idle RPG game where players - as Immortals - embark on epic quests, forging alliances and battling monsters to save the fallen world from the 7 Demons. Players can choose to enjoy the game either idly by automated battling and grinding process, or immersively by making choices in growing characters and participating in in-game governance. $IMT serves as the core game currency, enabling in-game transactions, governance participation, and staking for rewards. It drives demand through guild competitions, marketplace transactions, and revenue buybacks. Up to 50% of Web2 revenue supports buybacks, and up to 90% of $IMT-based revenue may be burned, ensuring long-term value accrual.","links":"https://immortalrising2.com/","market_cap":634742,"market_cap_rank":4281,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/immortal-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"immutable":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x80807723cfc04bf5dbe3186ebd8a7486e78cd8ca","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/immutable-zkevm/tokens/0x80807723cfc04bf5dbe3186ebd8a7486e78cd8ca"}},"is_native":false}
