{"name":"ShibVinci","id":"shibvinci","symbol":"shiv","description":"\"SHIBVINCI allows investors to hold a meme coin with a community treasury used to buy, own and trade NFTs, sharing profits with the holders. The ShibVinci Treasury is formed by a 3% buy & sell fee on $SHIV transactions. This means the Treasury grows anytime $SHIV tokens are bought or sold, increasing the size of the Treasury for the community governed NFT investments. Voting rights are gained by purchasing ShibVinci tokens - as long as you are a ShibVinci token holder, you have a right to vote on what NFT’s the Treasury fund will purchase, as well as when the treasury sells the NFT’s to make profits\"","links":"https://shibvinci.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/shibvinci/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xe9615071341c6f0392a5dfde1645ad01b810cb43"}}}
