{"name":"Kangaroo the Jumping Co​in","id":"kangaroo-the-jumping-co-in","symbol":"$roo","description":"$ROO coin is the top liquidity memecoin in the Stacks ecosytem, aiming to have a fair launch, with no initial allocation for founders, and no pretend valuations. Why $ROO? Well, here is a thread to give you some idea of what we are about and where we are going: Can a memecoin be more than a memecoin? This was one of the questions that we wanted to answer that ultimately led to the creation of the ROO token in the @Stacks ecosystem. However this question of course leads to a more fundamental question, which is: Why memecoins? Memecoins, at their most fundamental level, are an unintended consequence of the financial nihilism of our age. They offer a low barrier of entry for market participants and the potential to make outsized returns that simply are not available anywhere else. In addition to this, the culture surrounding memecoins is fun. Memecoin culture is created at the comunity level, and fosters a sense of camaraderie that anyone can experience. That isn’t to say that memecoins don’t come with significant drawbacks. Due to a variety of factors that we won’t get into at this time, the fact remains that trading memecoins produces many more losers than winners. With this in mind the grand ROO experiment was born.","links":"https://roo-stx.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kangaroo-the-jumping-co-in/logo.png","detail_platform":{"stacks":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"SP2C1WREHGM75C7TGFAEJPFKTFTEGZKF6DFT6E2GE.kangaroo"}}}
