{"name":"ATEHUN","id":"atehun","symbol":"atehun","description":"$atehun is short for $atehun'dred. Its derived from the first organic meme around hyperliquid: $800/pt. $800/pt was based on @crypto_adair long tweet thread that gave the bull case for Hyperliquid before they had a token and they just had a points program to award users. Essentially, @crypto_adair argued it was likely the best opportunity in crypto and is destined to be a top 10 coin which would make each point worth $800 in the next 12-18 months. $atehun represents this undying delusional bullishness on Hyperliquid as the future of finance.","links":"https://x.com/crypto_adair","market_cap":6338165,"market_cap_rank":2149,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/atehun/logo.png","detail_platform":{"hyperliquid":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xbebb35d03b83a302a2aa06dbaa67dd9f"}}}
