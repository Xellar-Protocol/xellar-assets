{"name":"375ai","id":"375ai_solana","symbol":"eat","description":"At 375ai, we're building a network of AI-enabled, camera-and-microphone-equipped edge sensors with full visibility of highways and city streets to unlock the value of real-world data, not only as a standalone data platform that is sold to ‘traditional’ data buyers, but as a feedstock providing ground truth for other AI systems - physical AI. The value of the 375ai network stems from its ability to provide massive real-time, contextual, and multimodal data on human and vehicular movement, infrastructure usage, social behaviors, and environmental conditions. This network effectively becomes a “sensory nervous system” for the physical world — feeding the growing ecosystem of AI models that aim to understand, predict, and intervene in the real world. In many ways, it’s the missing data layer needed to bridge the gap between AI’s virtual knowledge and real-world dynamics. This is why 375ai is poised to be one of the most strategically important data platforms powering use cases spanning a growing estate of real-time AI systems.","links":"https://www.375.ai/","market_cap":6682981,"market_cap_rank":1841,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/375ai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"375aiUqZERLrB9sHtsArKr4nuWCgBrtqibUDBMGeLvZC","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/375aiUqZERLrB9sHtsArKr4nuWCgBrtqibUDBMGeLvZC"}},"is_native":false}
