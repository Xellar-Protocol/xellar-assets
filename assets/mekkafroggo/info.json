{"name":"MekkaFroggo","id":"mekkafroggo","symbol":"mekka","description":"MEKKA FROGGO is a collection of 1,111 NFTs on Solana where two alliances are at war. We are Solana's first gamified staking wars game whereby holders can level up their Froggos, add more combat power to their alliance, and fight against the opposing team. The team has also launched Staking-as-a-Service in order to help generate revenue that will go back into project development. Our token, MEKKA, is what is used to train Froggos as well as to purchase other items such as super serum or MEKKA PASS.","links":"https://mekkafroggo.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mekkafroggo/logo.png"}
