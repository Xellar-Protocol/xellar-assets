{"name":"WOLF","id":"wolf-2","symbol":"wolf","description":"WOLF powers our Dapp ecosystem, originally developed by a founding team of eight who were determined to tackle the growing issues of scams and unreliable tokens in the crypto space. Now a team of ten, we remain committed to building a platform that empowers investors to participate with confidence. Our Dapp makes it easy to cut through the noise. Instead of spending hours trying to find legitimate projects in a sea of rugs, users can explore pre-vetted opportunities and even invest in multiple coins at once through our Packs — bundles of curated tokens designed to simplify diversification. Every project listed on our platform undergoes rigorous vetting, including technical due diligence and team verification. Only credible and trustworthy listings make it through. What does the Dapp mean for WOLF? Revenue generated through the Dapp is strategically reinvested into the ecosystem through $WOLF buybacks, liquidity pool reinforcement, and ongoing marketing. This helps drive long-term growth and value for the token. WOLF fuels the platform’s ongoing expansion. If you believe crypto should be transparent, secure, and community-focused, you’re in the right place. Our vision continues to evolve, with bold plans ahead. Stay tuned — there’s much more to come. WOLF is a FAIR-LAUNCH token, meaning everyone has an equal opportunity. This isn’t built for the elite — it’s built by the community, for the community. And we’re just getting started.","links":"https://www.thewolfonsol.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wolf-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"BTr5SwWSKPBrdUzboi2SVr1QvSjmh1caCYUkxsxLpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/BTr5SwWSKPBrdUzboi2SVr1QvSjmh1caCYUkxsxLpump"}}}
