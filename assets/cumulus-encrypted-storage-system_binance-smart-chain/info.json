CESS aims to address the pain points of traditional centralized data systems, including data security risks, privacy concerns, and high costs. CESS is constructed as a Layer 1 network based on the DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network), realizing decentralization, efficiency, security, privacy, and scalability. CESS enables the free flow and exchange of data value while protecting user privacy and data sovereignty. With CESS, users can easily transform their data into valuable assets, realizing “one-click” data monetization. CESS ensures data security and privacy while enabling the flow and exchange of data value across different applications, unlocking data as an asset. This will bring a more equitable and open digital economy to various industries, ultimately enabling every user to benefit from their own data. By prioritizing data sovereignty, CESS supports AI model training, real-time data access, and privacy-enhanced AI agent operations. CESS empowers AI-driven innovation, fostering the development of decentralized AI solutions while ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations and scalability for the future of intelligent systems.","links":"https://cess.network/","market_cap":8990577,"market_cap_rank":1634,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cumulus-encrypted-storage-system_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0c78d4605c2972e5f989de9019de1fb00c5d3462","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x0c78d4605c2972e5f989de9019de1fb00c5d3462"}},"is_native":false}
