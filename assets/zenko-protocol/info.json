{"name":"Zenko Protocol","id":"zenko-protocol","symbol":"zenko","description":"Zenko is a real-world engagement protocol that connects brand campaigns with on-chain incentives. Users earn $ZENKO tokens by completing actions like learning, moving, or playing. Brands fund these actions to reduce cost-per-lead and generate impact. All rewards are backed by real demand, with token buybacks and verified good (e.g. trees planted, carbon offset) recorded on-chain. • Yield machine powered by ad budgets – brands fund the system, not holders. • 100% fee loop – 50% auto buybacks, 50% to holder-voted environmental and social impact projects. • One token, multi-dApp demand – Zenko powers Learn-to-Earn, Move-to-Earn, Shop-to-Earn, and Play-to-Earn experiences. • Real-world flywheel – Brands cut CPL by +35%, create measurable ESG outcomes, and vacuum tokens off-market. • Already live with enterprise clients – including Fortune 500 brands and pro sports teams.","links":"https://www.zenkoprotocol.com/zenko-token","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/zenko-protocol/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"Zenko9EfTmbYVUw8RMjEW4vf7bNPSd419EjtpAFXeWw","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/Zenko9EfTmbYVUw8RMjEW4vf7bNPSd419EjtpAFXeWw"}}}
