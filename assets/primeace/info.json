{"name":"PrimeACE","id":"primeace","symbol":"peace","description":"PeACE is both an ERC20 and an ERC721 Token. It employs 404 + ERC5169 standards and includes a recycling and burning mechanism to minimize investment risk during extreme liquidity shortages. Ticket fees from ACE Arena and its Marketplace are funneled into an incentive pool, continually boosting the base price of each PeACE through the recycling program. Each PeACE token is equivalent to one Ace Avatar NFT. The ACE Avatar NFT Collection is an innovative set of NFTs derived from character images in the ACE Arena game. Each PeACE NFT represents a character from the game and can be used within the ACE Arena, providing ongoing benefits within the Endurance Eco-system. The collection aims to enhance liquidity, expand utility, and improve overall market fluidity.","links":"https://medium.com/@fusionistio/primeace-launchpad-2874c591a0d0","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/primeace/logo.png","detail_platform":{"endurance":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6a4a0c6f1f1644cee981ac9a6d9f4ff54ab3cd3d"}}}
