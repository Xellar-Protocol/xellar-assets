{"name":"Cluster","id":"cluster","symbol":"clstr","description":"Decentralized AI: Super Swarm of Models. Fine-tuning is the core of our Decentralized AI Super Swarm! We're building a decentralized AI ecosystem where a super swarm of specialized, smaller models collaborates to perform complex tasks, coordinated through a community-driven, modular architecture and governed by DAOs that manage LLM weights. This approach sidesteps the resource-intensive, monolithic LLMs of centralized giants, offering asymmetric advantages in efficiency, innovation, and community engagement. A \"super swarm\" refers to a decentralized network of AI models, each specialized for specific tasks or domains, that collaborate to perform complex, multi-step tasks. Unlike a single, general-purpose LLM (e.g., GPT-4), which handles diverse tasks within one model, a super swarm distributes intelligence across many smaller models, coordinated through a decentralized protocol. This mimics biological swarms (e.g., ant colonies), where simple agents collectively achieve sophisticated outcomes. Users & creators fine-tune models or contribute datasets, earning rewards for their work — think data curation, model training, or testing.","links":"https://simngmi.com","market_cap":214356,"market_cap_rank":5604,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cluster/logo.png","detail_platform":{"saga":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0xf11a9b22ea9d241607474c924561b39a1ff0bee3","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/saga/tokens/0xf11a9b22ea9d241607474c924561b39a1ff0bee3"}}}
