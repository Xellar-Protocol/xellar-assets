{"name":"Wrapped Bonk (Universal)","id":"wrapped-bonk-universal_base","symbol":"ubonk","description":"uBONK is a wrapped implementation of BONK designed to enable trading and DeFi integrations across multiple blockchains. BONK is the self-described “dog coin of the people”. BONK was initially airdropped to select Solana wallet addresses in December 2022, and has rapidly grown in popularity. BONK is currently the most held dog-themed cryptocurrency on the Solana blockchain. Universal is a cross-chain asset protocol that enables users to trade and utilize wrapped assets (uAssets) across multiple blockchains. uAssets are 1:1 backed representations of native cryptocurrencies, such as XRP, DOGE, and SUI, held in secure custody. This allows users to access and transact with assets that are not natively available on their preferred chains, without relying on bridges or centralized exchanges. Universal provides seamless trading, liquidity provision, and lending opportunities for uAssets, ensuring deep liquidity and security through institutional-grade custody and real-time proof of reserves.","links":"https://www.universal.xyz/tokens/uBONK","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wrapped-bonk-universal_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf56ce53561a9cc084e094952232bbfe1e5fb599e","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xf56ce53561a9cc084e094952232bbfe1e5fb599e"}},"is_native":false}
