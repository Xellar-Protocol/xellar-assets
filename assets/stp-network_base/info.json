The Autonomous Worlds Engine (AWE) is a modular framework enabling the creation of self-sustaining worlds for scalable agent-agent and human-agent collaboration. AWE scales interactions between thousands of autonomous agents using parallel processing, dependency management and GPU-optimized workloads. World.Fun is an autonomous worlds launcher that supports 1,000 agent AI-driven Autonomous Worlds powered by AWE. Users can create and customize agents to be deployed into these autonomous worlds using STPT.","links":"https://www.awenetwork.ai/","market_cap":110989611,"market_cap_rank":387,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/stp-network_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x1b4617734c43f6159f3a70b7e06d883647512778","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x1b4617734c43f6159f3a70b7e06d883647512778"}},"is_native":false}
