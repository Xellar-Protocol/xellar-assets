{"name":"Dogens","id":"dogens","symbol":"dogens","description":"BLOCKCHAIN FOR DEGENS Our Mission from ‚ÄúFollowers to Founders‚ÄùüöÄ With the bear market casting its shadow on crypto, our degen brothers and sisters were finding themselves falling victim to scams and rugs, their hard earned crypto being used as exit liquidity at the hands of greedy and malevolent influencers. The space has become a minefield of bad actors that can be perilous to traverse, even for the best of us, but that is all about to change with DOGENS. A safe haven for degens, built on trust and transparency, operated by a community of founders. Along these lines we have on boarded @Moontography to act as contract custodian and project overseer to ensure all our DOGENS family know they are in the safest of hands. The DOGENS team will be launching several utility sites that will be hooked up to the main token ($DOGENS). Starting with, an adventurous ‚Äúscavenger hunt‚Äù with prizes to be unlocked by clues found in high-end in-house movies. We also plan to build a number of gaming style Dapps with revenue streams which will flow directly back to you, our NFT and token holders. Dogens never forget, never forgotten.","links":"https://dogens.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dogens/logo.png"}
