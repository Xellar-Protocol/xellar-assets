The phrase \"All Roads Lead to Rome\" originally referred to the Roman Empire's road system and now means different paths can lead to the same outcome. The meme version recently resurfaced with the White Rabbit from Alice in Wonderland, clutching a clock like he's late. It took off because people started getting the image unexpectedly and without context. The joke is that no one really knows what it means, making it funny, confusing, and open to interpretation.","market_cap":415648,"market_cap_rank":4845,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/all-roads-lead-to-rome/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"8ZeTmGGktvSwSSghx8btbTAVGdWogThKM4DQBJgRpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/8ZeTmGGktvSwSSghx8btbTAVGdWogThKM4DQBJgRpump"}},"is_native":false}
