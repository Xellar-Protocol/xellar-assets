{"name":"Catcher DAO","id":"catcher-dao","symbol":"cdao","description":"Catcher DAO is an ERC-20 blockchain-based community built to rehabilitate past mistakes into good vibes. The motto and concept of Catcher DAO is “Reinventing Illiquid Assets”, we take dead tokens and give them value. $CDAO holders will be able to vote on which dead/illiquid tokens we will be rehabilitating next and the ratio at which they will be able to be exchanged for CDAO tokens. These CDAO tokens will then be vested for a predetermined amount of time to ease the pressure of large redemptions in the ecosystem. Catcher DAO keeps it simple with three main steps: Vote — Nominated and Vote for past failed projects that you think are deserving of a second chance. Catch — Tokens that pass quorum will be available for exchange at fair rates. Claim — Claim your new CDAO tokens, allowing you to have more voting power to determine the next rehabilitation project.","links":"https://catcherdao.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/catcher-dao/logo.png"}
