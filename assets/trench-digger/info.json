{"name":"Trench Digger","id":"trench-digger","symbol":"trench","description":"TrenchDigger is a decentralised protocol that enables users to express and trade market sentiment on any token through time-locked liquidity positions called Dwellings. Participants can take a bullish position by depositing $TRENCH to receive a target token (BullPost) or a bearish position by depositing the token to receive $TRENCH (CreateFUD), each for a defined duration. These positions are fully on-chain, tradable, and resolved at the end of their term. Counter-trades allow other users to challenge or support existing positions, creating an open market for sentiment-driven liquidity. TrenchDigger introduces behavioral liquidity as a novel mechanism within DeFi, combining transparent trading, on-chain governance of sentiment, and optional NFT-based position trading.","links":"https://www.trenchdigger.trade/","market_cap":251764,"market_cap_rank":6099,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/trench-digger/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd199e23e2396b4ad8734b7321ca0d435a97017a0","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xd199e23e2396b4ad8734b7321ca0d435a97017a0"}}}
