{"name":"Amiko","id":"amiko_solana","symbol":"amiko","description":"Amiko is a social identity infrastructure platform for creating behavior-first AI agents, known as “Amikos,” that simulate decision-making, emotional logic, and personality structure, rather than relying on prompt chaining or scraped data. These agents operate independently, conduct transactions, coordinate with each other, or assist users across various contexts including reflection, writing, and emotional support. Amiko’s system includes encrypted local memory, multi-agent orchestration, judgment modeling, and developer-accessible APIs for building with structured identity on an open source social graph. It is fully portable and runs with or without persistent memory, offering a scalable way to deploy user-owned agents across platforms.","links":"https://heyamiko.com/","market_cap":30457802,"market_cap_rank":874,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/amiko_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"AY1Ww6MxwC3cCiyrandHqLrp4FXvzgcwQTZpJ2FEpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/AY1Ww6MxwC3cCiyrandHqLrp4FXvzgcwQTZpJ2FEpump"}},"is_native":false}
