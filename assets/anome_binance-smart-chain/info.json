{"name":"Anome","id":"anome_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"anome","description":"Anome is a Web3 entertainment protocol that merges gaming, collectibles, and decentralized finance through NFT-based battle cards. The platform introduces a play-to-earn environment where users can mint, trade, and compete using unique digital assets on the blockchain. Each card carries intrinsic value supported by ERC-404 hybrid token standards, allowing partial ownership and deflationary mechanics through card burning and loss-mining. The core gameplay features 3x3 strategic battles where participants deploy cards with distinct attributes and earn rewards based on in-game outcomes. Beyond gaming, Anome supports ecosystem activities such as NFT staking, liquidity mining, and marketplace trading, fostering sustainable engagement for players, collectors, and investors alike. Designed as an open entertainment protocol, Anome aims to connect on-chain communities by transforming gaming interactions into measurable blockchain activities, providing transparent data on asset ownership, rewards distribution, and ecosystem growth.","links":"https://anome.xyz/","market_cap":1645860,"market_cap_rank":3170,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/anome_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6bc3855827fa6ee1229c937a26bb9fca1a0ffbf0","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x6bc3855827fa6ee1229c937a26bb9fca1a0ffbf0"}},"is_native":false}
