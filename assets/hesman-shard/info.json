{"name":"Hesman Shard","id":"hesman-shard","symbol":"hes","description":"Hesman Legend is launched to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the first publication of Vietnamese legendary superhero comic series - 'Dung si Hesman' (Hero Hesman). The project aims to evoke the memories of the comic lovers in the late 20th century as well as the pride in the spirit of Vietnam. With the mission of becoming a pioneer of projects involving NFTs in Vietnam, introducing domestic arts to the international community, Hesman Legend aims to be the first NFT project adapted from a comic series that has been rooted into the hearts of readers at the end of the twentieth century. To engage the community, the project will release NFTs with special benefits and a Play-to-Earn game of the same name. At the same time, the project promises to open a metaverse with the image of Hesman appearing in other products such as movies, games, animation and most likely with completely new character versions in the second part of the legendary series.","links":"https://hesman.net/en/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/hesman-shard/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x80a466cea081bdd8e9c3be80268aad16915d03d0"}}}
