{"name":"Piggy Bank","id":"piggy-bank-2","symbol":"piggy","description":"Piggy Bank is a game inspired by Pool Party & Grape Finance that encourages users to make strategic decisions about which Bank to deposit in, based on factors such as the annual percentage yield (APY), deposit duration, and the risk associated with each Bank. Bank 1 and Bank 2 are Cournot-style competitions where players deposit $PIGGY in a single-sided Bank. Then, the losing Bank pays out 10% of its tokens to the winning Bank every day. Bank 3 offers a variable APY for players to deposit $PIGGY-ETH LP tokens. Rewards are earned every 24 hours, and this Bank carries no risk of losing tokens to other Banks. However, Bank 3 will only be available for 14 days.","links":"https://piggy-bank.xyz/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/piggy-bank-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xdf121180af07cb906d970799627a430d2440c36d"}}}
