{"name":"Dephaser JPY","id":"dephaser-jpy_base","symbol":"jpyt","description":"DePhaser is a cutting-edge decentralized finance (DeFi) platform designed to transform the way people interact with digital assets and conduct cross-border transactions. At the heart of this innovation is JPYT, the world’s first algorithmic YEN stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the Japanese YEN (¥). Unlike traditional stablecoins, JPYT is backed by fully locked USDT (Tether), ensuring a high level of security, transparency, and trust for its users. Through DePhaser, individuals and businesses can seamlessly lock in USDT and mint JPYT, allowing them to hold and transact in a currency that mirrors the stability of the Yen while operating natively within the Web3 ecosystem. This mechanism provides a powerful tool for those who wish to avoid volatility in the crypto market while still benefiting from the efficiency, accessibility, and inclusivity of blockchain technology.","links":"https://dephaser.com/","market_cap":122934,"market_cap_rank":6667,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dephaser-jpy_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0xc47da4cb96ce65a96844a01bfae509f9d5454534","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xc47da4cb96ce65a96844a01bfae509f9d5454534"}},"is_native":false}
