{"name":"Bull God","id":"bull-god_base","symbol":"bullgod","description":"Bull God is a community-driven meme token built on the Base blockchain that blends mythology, culture, and digital branding. Designed as a movement rather than a typical meme coin, Bull God symbolizes resilience and optimism during market cycles. The project introduces multiple utilities including mascot marketing for real-world brand collaborations, NFT-based blind-box collectibles with rarity tiers, and transparent community engagement through regular AMAs and a doxxed YouTube channel. Revenue from campaigns flows directly into the treasury to sustain long-term growth, while real-world partnerships aim to bring the Bull God brand into mainstream industries. Its design emphasizes transparency, creativity, and cultural symbolism to unite crypto communities under a single emblem of growth and belief.","links":"https://www.bullgod.xyz/","market_cap":46992,"market_cap_rank":8303,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bull-god_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x56d4938431f7fae7c6741e061aa2683df12256f8","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x56d4938431f7fae7c6741e061aa2683df12256f8"}},"is_native":false}
