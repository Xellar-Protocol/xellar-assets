{"name":"SPARTA","id":"sparta-2","symbol":"sparta","description":"SPARTA is a hyper-deflationary token on PulseChain designed to reduce supply and increase value over time. It applies a 5% tax on every buy and sell; fees from these transactions are used to strengthen liquidity and burn tokens permanently. SPARTA is primarily paired with HEX, allowing it to benefit from HEX’s price performance through Heart’s Law. A supporting network of trading pairs drives volume, reinforcing liquidity and price stability.","links":"https://www.spartapls.com","market_cap":7026728,"market_cap_rank":1808,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/sparta-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"pulsechain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x52347c33cf6ca8d2cfb864aec5aa0184c8fd4c9b"}}}
