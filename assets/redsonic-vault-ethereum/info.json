{"name":"RedSonic Vault Ethereum","id":"redsonic-vault-ethereum","symbol":"rsveth","description":"RedSonic is an Ethereum zk Layer 2 solution released and maintained by Reddio. RedSonic Vault Ethereum (rsvETH) is a token that users receive when they deposit ETH, which replaces ETH for cross-chain operations to Layer 2. The ETH stored in RedSonic Vaults will be partially used for risk-free investments, and the generated returns will be proportionally distributed to all rsvETH holders. When users return from Layer 2, the exchange operation will be executed on Layer 1 Ethereum, burning rsvETH to retrieve the principal and all returns in ETH.","links":"https://www.reddio.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/redsonic-vault-ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xca9de1f80df74331c5fcb7eee2d05e746d47bfb2"}}}
