{"name":"Bolt","id":"bolt-2_solana","symbol":"bolt","description":"Solana traditionally has many rugs and Bolt's launch embodies the essence of bringing energy, trust, and community outreach back to Solana. See what Bolt is about below. Bolt is a streak of pure lightning given life a fast, lovable, and fearless guardian born from the Stormcore, the heart of the magical realm known as Cloudspire. Glowing with raw energy, Bolt moves faster than the eye can track, a living current that surges through the skies, rivers, and hidden realms. His mission is simple but powerful: protect the Cloudspire from the shadows that seek to consume it. This isn’t just a character it’s a movement. The Bolt community carries his energy into the digital realm, spreading light, speed, and fun while standing against the “Nullis” of the crypto world fear, doubt, and negativity. The Bolt ecosystem is built for community raids, high-energy engagement, and a long-term journey toward building one of the most iconic meme coins on the Solana chain.","links":"https://boltonsol.dev","market_cap":1692.57,"market_cap_rank":13056,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bolt-2_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"BoLTp38Aqnaewa1yJ98tLx19y5DEQgrDjtwWv3k9hBxu","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/BoLTp38Aqnaewa1yJ98tLx19y5DEQgrDjtwWv3k9hBxu"}},"is_native":false}
