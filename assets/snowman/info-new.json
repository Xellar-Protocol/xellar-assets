{"name":"Snowman","id":"snowman","symbol":"snow","description":"ðŸ‘‰ Snowman: The Heartbeat of Ice Meme Launchpad From its inception, Snowman Meme Coin was envisioned to be more than just a token; it was destined to be the cornerstone of the Ice Meme Launchpad. We embarked on this journey with a vision but were unprepared for the extraordinary saga Snowman would unfold. Now, Snowman is more than just a part of the Ice Meme Launchpad; it's its essence. Reflecting our initial aspirations, Snowman has become the compass guiding our journey through the ever-evolving meme coin realm, showcasing the limitless possibilities within this vibrant crypto universe. As we forge ahead, we invite you to be part of this historic venture, crafting the future of meme coins, just as we imagined from the start. ðŸ‘‰ Meme Coins Launch Structure Every launch in our ecosystem is structured to foster sustainability and growth. Each involves two liquidity pools: one pairing SNOW (Snowman) and the other Ethereum (ETH) with the new meme coin. The 50% ETH â€“ NEW_MEME and 50% SNOW â€“ NEW_MEME allocation creates a balanced platform suitable for both seasoned and new traders. A key element of our strategy is the 101-year lock on both liquidity pools, ensuring long-term ecosystem stability. With each launch, the circulating SNOW supply is methodically reduced, vital for maintaining the health and longevity of our meme coin ecosystem and securing a thriving future for all involved.","links":"https://ice.site.strattic.io/snowman","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/snowman/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":null}}}
