{"name":"Savings USD0","id":"savings-usd0_ethereum","symbol":"susd0","description":"The Usual protocol is a decentralized finance framework centered around yield bearing assets such as RWA or blue chip protocol tokens. It embodies the principle of redistributing value generated by users through a revenue-based token, USUAL. This approach enables users to access yields while simultaneously gaining exposure to the protocol’s growth and long-term success. Its innovative distribution model sets the stage for new DeFi possibilities, accelerating ecosystem expansion and sustainable decentralization.","links":"https://usual.money/","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/savings-usd0_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd861be82dee3223cfbed160791f6550b0704d406","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xd861be82dee3223cfbed160791f6550b0704d406"}},"is_native":false}
