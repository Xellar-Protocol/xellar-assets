{"name":"Hyperlane","id":"hyperlane_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"hyper","description":"Hyperlane is an open-source, permissionless framework for blockchain interoperability. Today, it connects over 170 blockchains and supports 5+ virtual machines, powering hundreds of interchain applications on a daily basis—from asset bridges and cross-chain governance to emerging DeFi use cases.
