{"name":"Chain4Energy","id":"chain4energy","symbol":"c4e","description":"Chain4Energy (C4E) is a global decentralized blockchain ecosystem and WEB 3.0 Energy Marketplace which enables institutions and individuals to seamlessly participate in the renewable energy market accessing and offering a wide range of renewable energy solutions and services. We have built a solution that leverages the power of blockchain technology to enable the transition to the new decentralized energy world. So what is beautiful about it, is that both “normal people” and companies can participate and exchange energy. Our marketplace will use the C4E token for in-platform transactions and as a part of the rewards system for the energy suppliers. Staking and farming will come as well, and we will also implement the DAO and Governance features. Our project is built on Cosmos SDK as a sovereign app specific blockchain.","links":"https://c4e.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/chain4energy/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
