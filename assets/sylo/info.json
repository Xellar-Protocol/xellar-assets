{"name":"Sylo","id":"sylo","symbol":"sylo","description":"The Sylo Protocol provides confidential communication as a utility to the Sylo Confidential Communication App. The protocol acts as the confidential networking layer for the Sylo App, creating P2P connections and providing a way for users to interact and exchange data confidentially. The Sylo Protocol is being developed to provide fully decentralised confidential communication as a utility to all connected-apps within the Sylo ecosystem. Powered by blockchain and combined with other decentralised technologies, this Protocol will act as the networking layer for the Sylo DApp and 3rd-party connected-apps, while providing charging options for specific communications and services over the network. The fully decentralised Sylo DApp will be the 1st application built on the blockchain-based Sylo Protocol, using technology already commercialised in the Sylo App thatâ€™s currently used by thousands globally, available on Apple Store and Google Play Store. The Sylo DApp will be released in public beta in Q4 this year. Sylo is a decentralised communication and data exchange network powered by a layer 2 micropayments infrastructure and the $SYLO token. User-run Service Peers provide infrastructure to the network which allows developers and businesses to run privacy-first, unstoppable apps without deploying any infrastructure of their own. A staking architecture and unique probabilistic ticketing solution ensure minimal transaction fees and limitless scalability. This scalability is already on show within the projects flagship app, the Sylo Smart Wallet; a decentralised, private messenger and crypto wallet with over a quarter million users.","links":"https://www.sylo.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/sylo/logo.png"}
