{"name":"Haven1 Bridged Wrapped ETH","id":"haven1-bridged-wrapped-eth","symbol":"heth","description":"hETH is a wrapped representation of native Ether (ETH) that circulates on the Haven1 Layer-1 network. It is minted when users lock ETH in Haven1's audited Canonical Bridge on Ethereum Mainnet and receive an equal amount of hETH on Haven1. The bridge maintains a transparent 1 : 1 backing, enabling holders to redeem hETH for ETH at any time. By porting ETH liquidity into Haven1, hETH powers DeFi trading and staking within an EVM-equivalent, zero-fee environment.","links":"https://www.haven1.org","market_cap":1090506,"market_cap_rank":4030,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/haven1-bridged-wrapped-eth/logo.png","detail_platform":{"haven1":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa4e7604d7a3f9f7a2ee79723cae4122a72bc6984","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/haven1/tokens/0xa4e7604d7a3f9f7a2ee79723cae4122a72bc6984"}}}
