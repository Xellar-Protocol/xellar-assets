{"name":"Blue Protocol","id":"blue-protocol","symbol":"blue","description":"BLUE Protocol is a decentralized reserve currency system built on BNB Chain, forked from Olympus DAO. The protocol maintains a treasury-backed reserve currency called BLUE, where each token is backed by a diversified treasury of reserve assets including BOOK tokens, BUD stablecoin, BNB, and liquidity pool tokens. The protocol operates through a rebasing mechanism that provides staking rewards to participants. Users who stake BLUE tokens receive sBLUE, which automatically rebases every 4 hours at a rate of 0.286% per epoch, targeting an annual percentage yield of 50,000%. The protocol features six rebases daily, with rewards auto-compounding without requiring user action.","links":"https://www.bluebnb.xyz","market_cap":675937,"market_cap_rank":4717,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/blue-protocol/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xa90298e5b1203a2dd0006a75eabe158989c406fb","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xa90298e5b1203a2dd0006a75eabe158989c406fb"}}}
