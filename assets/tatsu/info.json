{"name":"Tatsu","id":"tatsu","symbol":"tatsu","description":"Project Overview: The Taτsu Ecosystem represents a decentralized platform built on the Bittensor network, aiming to revolutionize the landscape of AI and machine learning applications. It leverages the collective intelligence of distributed machine learning models to offer a wide range of services, catering to developers, businesses, and end-users. Purpose: The primary purpose of the Taτsu Ecosystem is to democratize access to advanced AI and machine learning capabilities. By harnessing the power of decentralized technology, it seeks to empower individuals and organizations to develop and deploy AI-driven solutions without relying on centralized authorities or infrastructure. Functionality: Decentralized AI Services: The ecosystem provides a decentralized platform where users can access a variety of AI services, including image generation, text-to-speech conversion, translation, and more. These services are powered by distributed machine learning models running on the Bittensor network. API Access: Taτsu offers API access, allowing developers to integrate AI functionalities into their applications seamlessly. This API provides developers with scalable access to decentralized AI capabilities, fostering innovation and enabling the creation of new AI-driven products and services. Bittensor Subnet Deployment: The project aims to deploy its own Bittensor subnet, enhancing its autonomy, performance, and customization capabilities. This subnet will serve as a dedicated infrastructure for running AI models, catering to specific use cases and offering enhanced reliability and efficiency. Utility: The TATSU token serves as the native utility token within the Taτsu Ecosystem, playing a crucial role in facilitating transactions, accessing services, and participating in governance. Token holders can stake their TATSU tokens to receive a share of the ecosystem's revenue, incentivizing long-term participation and investment in the platform.","links":"https://tatsuecosystem.io","market_cap":2959947,"market_cap_rank":2488,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/tatsu/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x92f419fb7a750aed295b0ddf536276bf5a40124f"}}}
