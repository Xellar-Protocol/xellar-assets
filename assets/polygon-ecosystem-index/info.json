{"name":"Amun Polygon Ecosystem Index","id":"polygon-ecosystem-index","symbol":"peco","description":"Amun’s Polygon Ecosystem Index (PECO) is composed of the top tokens in the Polygon ecosystem. PECO provides investors with exposure to the leading projects in the Polygon ecosystem through either a Polygon native token or an Ethereum token tied to the Polygon assets. Consisting of 50% Matic, PECO gives holders an alternative to only holding Matic and instead gives them a token that grows with the entire ecosystem, not just the base token. Given Polygon’s low transaction fees and growing ecosystem, we believe that PECO can grow to include a large number of constituents so long as they satisfy Amun’s inclusion criteria.","links":"https://tokens.amun.com/polygon-ecosystem-index","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/polygon-ecosystem-index/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x9d3ee6b64e69ebe12a4bf0b01d031cb80f556ee4"},"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa9536b9c75a9e0fae3b56a96ac8edf76abc91978"}}}
