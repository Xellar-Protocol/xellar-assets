{"name":"KarmaCoin","id":"karmacoin","symbol":"karma","description":"Introduction: $KARMA is brought to life by a council of seven, featuring OnChainMonkey (OCM) community leaders Soldman Gachs, Fitzy, Rabbi, and Drheref, alongside BennyTheDev and Alex Philippine from Tap Protocol, and Jason Fang from Sora Ventures. This team brings a mix of community engagement and technical expertise to the project. Technical Background: Built on the TAP Protocol, $KARMA aims to provide a novel way of tracking Ordinals metaprotocols on Bitcoin, offering DeFi capabilities that extend beyond traditional BRC-20 tokens. Distribution Achievement: The airdrop of $KARMA to 60,957 wallets during late February 2024 represents a significant step in our project's journey, marking it as a widely distributed fungible token on Bitcoin. The commencement of trading on ordinalswallet.com and ongoing wallet support are key steps toward broader acceptance. Financial Strategy: Securing 500,000 $TRAC for our treasury, with a valuation of USD 3.5 million, underlines our commitment to a strong financial base for $KARMA's future endeavors. Community Engagement and Utility: Implementing a tier system, $KARMA seeks to engage the community effectively, borrowing from established practices in the crypto space. This, along with special artist drops and transactional features enabled by TAP Protocol, aims to enhance the project's utility and market presence. Future Directions: Our roadmap includes plans for asset staking to support the TAP Protocol and provide rewards to $KARMA holders, focusing on practical steps to grow the project's ecosystem and value. Conclusion: The introduction of $KARMA is a step towards fostering a more interconnected and active blockchain community. We encourage the community and potential stakeholders to join us in this effort, aiming for a project that contributes positively to the Ordinals space.","links":"https://karmacoin.xyz/","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/karmacoin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ordinals":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
