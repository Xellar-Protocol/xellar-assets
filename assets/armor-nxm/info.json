{"name":"Armor NXM","id":"armor-nxm","symbol":"arnxm","description":"The arNXM Vault allows users to deposit their wNXM tokens in the Nexus Mutual ecosystem and earn yield without requiring KYC. Users receive a new arNXM token as a replacement which is the yield bearing token for the vault and is not subject to the mandatory 90-day (soon 30 day) lockup period. The vault will hold a set amount in the reserve to provide liquidity for exchanges between arNXM and wNXM tokens and stake the remaining holdings into the Nexus Mutual system to generate yield.","links":"https://armor.fi/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/armor-nxm/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x1337def18c680af1f9f45cbcab6309562975b1dd"}}}
