Executive Summary In a digital landscape increasingly dominated by AI agents, access to authentic source data has become the new digital gold. The 4GS Protocol introduces a groundbreaking paradigm: the first-ever Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Data Brokerage system, specifically designed to capture, process, and distribute genuine source intelligence from fragmented data sources. Through a sophisticated network of AI agents working together, the protocol monitors, captures, and aggregates data across multiple platforms. This cross-platform approach ensures capture of authentic community signals at their source, rather than relying on downstream information. Our upstream data collection and distribution system allows AI agents to tap into interactions, decisions, and insights that are typically difficult to capture effectively. 4GS serves as a crucial upstream data provider in the AI agent ecosystem, ensuring that downstream agents, humans, and organizations can leverage unique source data effectively. 4GS not only delivers raw data but also performs semantic aggregations to produce context-aware insights, enabling users to make informed decisions. 4GS addresses a fundamental challenge in the AI industry by providing scalable access to authentic, real-time human intelligence through both raw data and actionable insights.","links":"https://4gentic.com/","market_cap":49768,"market_cap_rank":7577,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/4gentic/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x135fa55546758cf398da675a064f39d215ab1ff6","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x135fa55546758cf398da675a064f39d215ab1ff6"}}}
