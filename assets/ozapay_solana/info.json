It enables users to pay, receive, and exchange in euro, dollar, pound sterling, or cryptocurrencies via NFC or QR code, without the need for a payment terminal. The ecosystem includes both virtual and physical Mastercard cards, a cashback system in OZA tokens provided by merchants, and a partner network offering up to 70% discounts. The OZA token is at the core of the model, serving as both a reward mechanism and a transactional asset. The project’s purpose is to deliver a sovereign, simple alternative to traditional banking while complying with regulatory standards (KYC/KYB/AML).","links":"https://www.ozapay.me","market_cap":25384705,"market_cap_rank":986,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ozapay_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":2,"contract_address":"67iVSrbgQKiPjttU9uXx9CXUoS1Si3XUhrXeiNAUUZSR","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/67iVSrbgQKiPjttU9uXx9CXUoS1Si3XUhrXeiNAUUZSR"}},"is_native":false}
