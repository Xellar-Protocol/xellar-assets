{"name":"Qudefi","id":"qudefi","symbol":"qdfi","description":"Qudefi is designed to bridge the gap between individual investors and large financial institutions by leveraging AI advanced risk management and trading software. Unlike institutions that seek steady returns with robust risk management, small investors often struggle to achieve significant gains. Qudefiâ€™s software, originally developed for risk management, now serves as a comprehensive trading tool focused on derivatives, not limited to one instrument. By pooling funds from many investors, Qudefi can trade at high volumes, generating substantial profits from trading spreads. These profits are then airdropped to token holders. This pooling of resources allows small investors to benefit from the high-volume trading and returns typically accessible only to large institutions, providing them with greater returns and reduced risks","links":"https://qudefi.ai/","market_cap":346773,"market_cap_rank":4010,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/qudefi/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x405919920765e8d30822db9342b62bb0f92976e8"}}}
