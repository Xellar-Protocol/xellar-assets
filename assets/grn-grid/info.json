{"name":"GRN Grid","id":"grn-grid","symbol":"g","description":"GRN is the indigenous token of the GRID Blockchain and serves primarily as on-chain governance, payment for transaction fees and on-chain liquidity for EXNode. The Grid is a layer 1 blockchain that is built with focus on five pillars: Security, Sustainability, Speed, Scalability and Stability. Grid aims to set an example in safety and scalability while taking a sustainability first approach. The Grid is built utilising a novel approach to Proof of Stake with logarithmic weighted stake-voting rights and locked security pools. The weighting causes a progressive payout of validating rewards and is an industry first. These approach is chosen to counter two main drawbacks of PoS based consensus, namely decentralisation and accumulation of wealth by the top holders. Grid is widely interoperable with existing libraries in the blockchain industry, while also implementing key features for easier transition from other (de) centralized technologies. Included among these features are an integrated payment and escrow system, exchanging pools, and encrypted communications. These features are listed below:","links":"https://grngrid.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/grn-grid/logo.png"}
