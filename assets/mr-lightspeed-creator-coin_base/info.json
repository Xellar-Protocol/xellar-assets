{"name":"Mr. Lightspeed Creator Coin","id":"mr-lightspeed-creator-coin_base","symbol":"mr_lightspeed","description":"The Mr_Lightspeed Creator Coin operates inside Zora’s Coins Protocol on Base. The model pairs a profile-level Creator Coin with post-level Content Coins, both ERC-20s, each trading in a dedicated Uniswap v4 pool. A custom hook routes a share of every swap to the creator and to referrers, while a portion of fees is locked to deepen liquidity. The result is an education-first creator token with transparent, non-custodial markets and protocolized incentives aligned to publishing quality content. This project uses Zora’s onchain coin rails to link educational content to observable market signals. One coin represents the creator profile, and individual posts can mint their own tradable coins. Each coin’s market is a Uniswap v4 pool, so prices and depth reflect demand. Fees on each trade are split by the protocol to reward the creator and eligible referrers. The objective is to fund ongoing primers, risk guides, and research with a transparent fee model rather than custodial ad revenue or paywalls.","links":"https://zora.co/@mr_lightspeed","market_cap":415650,"market_cap_rank":4844,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mr-lightspeed-creator-coin_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf0cb96a4011a0a6f73d100c7080bf8020d10f87a","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xf0cb96a4011a0a6f73d100c7080bf8020d10f87a"}},"is_native":false}
