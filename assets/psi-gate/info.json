{"name":"PSI Gate","id":"psi-gate","symbol":"psi/acc","description":"PSI/ACC is a highly experimental and aspirational project seeking to expand the landscape of meditation and Brain-Machine Interfacing research and technology, it is the first TAO ERC-404 project. Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) Research: We are advancing the study of BMIs to effectively capture and interpret brainwave data during meditation. This research aims to understand how different brainwave patterns correlate with meditative states and how BMIs can facilitate deeper meditation. Blockchain Infrastructure: We are developing a robust, decentralized blockchain framework to securely manage the collection and analysis of meditation data. This system ensures the integrity and privacy of the data while allowing for transparent and verifiable research. AI-Driven Analysis: Our team is designing sophisticated AI and machine learning algorithms to assess brainwave coherence and refine meditation techniques. These algorithms will help identify optimal meditation practices for individuals and groups. Experimental Research: We are conducting experimental studies with meditation practitioners to explore the impact of various brainwave frequencies and coherence levels on the meditative experience. Incentives for Participation: To encourage participation, we are offering blockchain-based tokens as rewards for those who contribute data on their meditation experiences and outcomes. #ProofOfChill","links":"https://psi-acc.box/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/psi-gate/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xbfe178cf147fda6490f69fe7e6ae038ff09d2980"}}}
