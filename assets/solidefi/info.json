{"name":"SoliDefi","id":"solidefi","symbol":"solfi","description":"SoliDefi is a platform primarily focused on token security. It features a never-before-seen Solana Token/LP locker that pays out APY for locking LP tokens. The utility went live on launch, and most importantly solves a major Solana need while providing an incredible investment opportunity. The platform is set to rapidly expand with the success of the locker – and in light of the increased stability of $SOLFI's holders over time.","links":"https://getsolfi.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/solidefi/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"CLaSKXbuMp1BXTya62WDyZoPvgmfcqsdA18rAjBcn9Vw","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/CLaSKXbuMp1BXTya62WDyZoPvgmfcqsdA18rAjBcn9Vw"}}}
