{"name":"Tensor","id":"tensor_solana","symbol":"tnsr","description":"The TNSR token governs the protocols underlying Tensor and Vector. 50% of protocol fees from both products accrue to the TNSR treasury. Tensor launched in July 2022 and is the leading NFT marketplace on Solana, commanding 60-70% of Solana NFT market share. It gained momentum by catering to NFTs traders instead of just collectors with real-time data, pro charting tools, and a fast terminal interface. Vector is the leading social trading app in crypto. Within 3 months of launch, it grew to $7.5 billion of annualized volume and 20k daily active users, both of which are doubling every 1-2 weeks. It generates $75M/year in fees of which 50% goes directly to the TNSR treasury.","links":"https://www.tensor.foundation","market_cap":29305434,"market_cap_rank":895,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/tensor/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"TNSRxcUxoT9xBG3de7PiJyTDYu7kskLqcpddxnEJAS6","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/TNSRxcUxoT9xBG3de7PiJyTDYu7kskLqcpddxnEJAS6"}},"is_native":false}
