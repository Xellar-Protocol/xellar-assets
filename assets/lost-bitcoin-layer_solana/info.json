{"name":"Lost Bitcoin Layer","id":"lost-bitcoin-layer_solana","symbol":"atom","description":"A story that suggests Bitcoin, as we know it, is only half of Satoshi's vision. The other half? ATOM. It was erased. Buried in commented-out code. Lost before Bitcoin's public release. And yet, their fingerprints remain. I rebuilt first Bitcoin commit with ATOM and launched THIS web wallet interface. So you can experience history firsthand! Mine Bitcoin and earn ATOMS just like in Satoshi's first code. I also recreated the marketplace and ratings system exactly as Satoshi envisioned. All the proof is on this page. To bring maximum attention to this OG meta, I launched a meme token [ATOM] Lost Bitcoin Layer on PumpFun - Yeah, it’s a crappy idea, but I don’t know another way to quickly draw your attention.","links":"https://lostatom.org","market_cap":5985.45,"market_cap_rank":12101,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/lost-bitcoin-layer_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"6KeQaJXFHczWKjrcXdMGKP773JKQmMWDXy4446adpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/6KeQaJXFHczWKjrcXdMGKP773JKQmMWDXy4446adpump"}},"is_native":false}
