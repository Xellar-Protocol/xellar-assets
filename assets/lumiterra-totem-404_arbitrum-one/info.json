Integrating Lumiterra's latest profit mechanisms and leveraging advanced digital asset protocols like ERC404, the Totem 404 Series NFT assets not only offer internal and external incentives and airdrops to enhance their value but also introduce a unique gameplay innovation. Owners benefit from advantages in Homeland PvP, ticket revenue from PvEP dungeon investments, and the promise of more empowering features. The integration of strategic gameplay with a robust asset ecosystem highlights the potential for growth and enriches the Lumi experience. Moreover, the Totem 404 Series introduces an innovative in-game mechanism where players can place and nurture totems on their farms by praying and contributing resources for their growth. Uniquely, players owning totem assets can invest in various PVEP instances using resources, providing extra rewards for the instance and opening a new revenue stream. Importantly, totem holders can enjoy the investment returns without personally engaging in the instance challenges, while players who participate and win can receive rewards, loot, and resources invested by the totem players. This mechanism fosters player interaction and cooperation, promoting a mutually beneficial game ecosystem.","links":"https://docs.lumiterra.net/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/lumiterra-totem-404/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa6ef0ad746d1c35d6ff4d66ceeae0e596d742924","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/arbitrum/tokens/0xa6ef0ad746d1c35d6ff4d66ceeae0e596d742924"}},"is_native":false}
