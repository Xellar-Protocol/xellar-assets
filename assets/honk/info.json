{"name":"Honk","id":"honk","symbol":"honk","description":"Honk is the first goose-themed coin on the Solana blockchain. $HONK was inspired by an audacious goose known for aspiring to be a boss, featured in the viral video game \"Untitled Goose Game.\" $HONK was launched on January 13, 2023, as a competitor to $BONK on Solana, cementing their never-ending rivalry in the crypto space. As a fully decentralized memecoin, $HONK has 0% tax, its liquidity is burnt (locked for eternity), and mint authority was revoked at launch, making it a coin by and for the people. The main goal of HONK is to escalate its rivalry with BONK to a whole new level and leverage the power of memes to catapult itself to the top of the memecoin space on the Solana blockchain.","links":"https://honk.lol/","market_cap":3768012,"market_cap_rank":2102,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/honk/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"3ag1Mj9AKz9FAkCQ6gAEhpLSX8B2pUbPdkb9iBsDLZNB"}}}
