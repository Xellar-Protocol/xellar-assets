{"name":"Stride Staked Juno","id":"stride-staked-juno","symbol":"stjuno","description":"Stride Staked Juno is the token received in exchange for staking JUNO with Stride. STJUNO is redeemable 1:1 for JUNO, subject to the unbonding period on JUNO. Stride is currently in mainnet with 100+ validators, and supports staking ATOM, JUNO, OSMO and STARS with the intention to add functionality to many more zones (with the token for each zone having its own stToken). Mainnet will launch in late July 2022. Stride is a multichain liquid staking zone (appchain) on the Cosmos Blockchain. Stride allows users to stake any IBC-compatible tokens, and receive stTokens in return, which are redeemable for the original token at a 1:1 ratio. By staking their tokens using Stride, users will be able to earn staking rewards, while also retaining liquidity in the form of stTokens, which will allow them to take advantage of Cosmos DeFi and pursue more yields there. Stride is backed by some of the top validators and investors in the Cosmos ecosystem such as Imperator, Everstake, 1Confirmation, Pantera, North Island Ventures.","links":"https://www.stride.zone/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/stride-staked-juno/logo.png","detail_platform":{"osmosis":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":"IBC/46B44899322F3CD854D2D46DEEF881958467CDD4B3B10086DA49296BBED94BED"}}}
