{"name":"Spiko Digital Assets Cash & Carry Fund","id":"spiko-digital-assets-cash-carry-fund_ethereum","symbol":"spkcc","description":"- Spiko Cash & Carry is a systematic fund that allocates each month to whichever opportunity offers the highest net return between a classic crypto cash-and-carry trade on CME futures, or short-duration U.S. Treasury bills. The fund seeks to lock in predictable, market-neutral returns that exceed the prevailing risk-free rate. Investor returns directly reflect the performance of a transparent, rules-based strategy index, offering institutional-grade exposure to a market-neutral cash-and-carry approach without taking directional crypto or interest-rate risk.","links":"https://www.spiko.io/spiko-cash-and-carry","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/spiko-digital-assets-cash-carry-fund_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":5,"contract_address":"0x4f33acf823e6eeb697180d553ce0c710124c8d59","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x4f33acf823e6eeb697180d553ce0c710124c8d59"}},"is_native":false}
