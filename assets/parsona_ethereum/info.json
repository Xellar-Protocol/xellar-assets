{"name":"Parsona","id":"parsona_ethereum","symbol":"sona","description":"Parsona is an encrypted, self-custodial identity protocol designed for the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to create and maintain a persistent digital identity using nothing more than a username and password - while still generating a real Ethereum-compatible wallet under the hood. Unlike conventional wallet-based systems that require extensions, seed phrases, or public key exposure, Parsona offers a privacy-first identity layer that acts as the gateway to the entire Ethereum ecosystem. This identity is not just an authentication method; it's a composable, encrypted persona that users can carry across decentralized applications (dApps), messaging systems, onchain transactions, agent networks, and DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure) protocols. Everything a user does - from sending messages to participating in missions or delegating to AI agents - is tied to their Parsona, not to a publicly exposed wallet address. At its core, Parsona aims to solve the fragmentation and privacy issues present in Web3 by offering a universal, encrypted, and user-controlled identity that works seamlessly across the decentralized internet.","links":"http://parsona.org","market_cap":4052.45,"market_cap_rank":12637,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/parsona/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd570bd9f7993e94b5af964fcf6b2027966d5b728","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xd570bd9f7993e94b5af964fcf6b2027966d5b728"}},"is_native":false}
