{"name":"Florin","id":"florin","symbol":"xfl","description":"A holder is a Florin user that locks his/her Florin in the desktop application for a certain period of time. Holding secures the blockchain and in return the holder is rewarded Florin. Blocks that are mined by a miner can only be part of the blockchain after a holder has verified them. Holders are anonymous and are chosen randomly. Therefore, for verification purposes, the miner must broadcast its block to the entire network. The holder also transmits the verified block to the entire network. This means that a miner cannot extend the blockchain without sharing the block with the entire network. This solves several problems of a standard Proof of Work blockchain.","links":"https://florin.org/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/florin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
