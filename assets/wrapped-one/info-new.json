{"name":"Wrapped One","id":"wrapped-one","symbol":"wone","description":"W-ONE is \"wrapped Harmony ONE\", a HRC-20 fungible token minted on Harmony. Harmony’s open, decentralized network is enabled through the use of the native protocol token - Harmony ONE. The token incentivizes and rewards a variety of participants including developers, validators/stakers, investors, and community members who develop, secure and govern the network. In order to use the network, users pay a small transaction fee denominated in the native Harmony token. Harmony’s scalable, high-throughput protocol is powered by a native token which is used for various forms of payment and participation in the protocol (staking, transaction fees, voting & governance). Harmony uses blockchain to align incentives of different stakeholders, developers and businesses while allowing them to build open marketplaces of fungible and non-fungible tokens and assets. Furthermore, the upcoming application of zero-knowledge proofs will allow Harmony to become a data sharing platform that can overcome the conflicting problem plaguing many information and data markets: that individual market participants’ have mutual distrust to share data but strong desire to acquire data themselves. The Harmony token will function in the following aspects of the protocol: The token is used for staking, which is necessary to participate in the POS consensus & earn block rewards and transaction fees. The token is used to pay for transaction fees, gas and storage fees. The token is used in voting for on-chain governance of the protocol.","links":"https://harmony.one/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wrapped-one/logo.png","detail_platform":{"harmony-shard-0":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xcf664087a5bb0237a0bad6742852ec6c8d69a27a"},"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x03ff0ff224f904be3118461335064bb48df47938"},"energi":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd001188ee1830425fd2b0fb21f6f3bb79bab161e"}}}
