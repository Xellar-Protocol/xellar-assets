{"name":"Carbon Earth Token","id":"carbon-earth-token","symbol":"cet","description":"Carbon Earth Tokens (CET) are used to automate and streamline the distribution of carbon credits that are generate through decarbonisation projects. Investors buy CET and stake it on our platform, which will allow them to automatically receive carbon credits from the investments. The proceeds of CET sales are used to fund the decarbonisation projects, so each CET entitles the owner to carbon credits, because each CET is proof of investment into sustainability. Carbon credits that are generated through cross-border institutional transactions are also aded to the staking pools and distributed to CET holders. CET can be bought/sold to 3rd parties if individuals or companies require more/less inflows of carbon credits, so we will not be holding client money or acting as a custodian of their digital assets.","links":"https://carbon.earth/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/carbon-earth-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x430bf5e78c1a2f2644d93235e2f0269407b7eb79"}}}
