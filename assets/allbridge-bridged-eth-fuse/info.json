{"name":"Allbridge Bridged ETH (Fuse)","id":"allbridge-bridged-eth-fuse","symbol":"aeeth","description":"Allbridge aeETH (Fuse) is the bridged version of Ethereum (ETH) token on Fuse network bridged through Allbridge classic dapp. Ethereum is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain that powers decentralized applications (dApps) through smart contracts, without being controlled by a centralized entity. As the first blockchain to feature smart contracts, it has the largest ecosystem of decentralized applications, ranging from decentralized exchanges to crypto lending and borrowing platforms and more. Ethereum is also home to numerous Layer 2 solutions that offer users a cheaper and faster way to process transactions on the blockchain. Some of these solutions include Arbitrum, which rolls up multiple transactions into a single transaction on Ethereum, and Polygonâ€™s Proof-of-Stake chain, which is a sidechain that runs parallel to the Ethereum blockchain.","links":"https://fuse.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/allbridge-bridged-eth-fuse/logo.png","detail_platform":{"fuse":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xcc9d144a8a8a1e71d5ec66a13f301b9e0137e71c"}}}
