{"name":"FrenCoin","id":"frencoin","symbol":"fren","description":"Based on the \"\"Apu Apustaja\"\" and \"\"fren\"\" memes, this project is designed to facilitate wholesome interactions, on and off the blockchain. The primary usecase for this coin will be to facilitate a web-based NFT trading card game which is currently in development. FrenCoin is currently in the middle of its third NFT creation contest, in which members of the community design their own FreNFT based on a certain theme. The cards are then voted on by the community, with the top selections being minted as NFT (view our collection here https://solsea.io/collection/619842395214e3c509d16a86). These FreNFT will be the trading cards used for the game, which should have a playable alpha in the next few weeks. Secondary usecases for FrenCoin include FrenTips, which allows holders of the token to tip others for wholesome work, such as a \"\"frenly\"\" post or commissioning an artist to create a FreNFT. The framework for FrenTips is finished, but the token must be listed by CoinGecko prior to implementation. Finally, FrenCoin team members are creating Frens Look Out For Frens (FLOFF) cards, which provide helpful information on how to avoid common cryptocurrency scams; seven of which are already circulating on popular social media platforms.","links":"https://frencoin.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/frencoin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x1f8a1efbf6247139fb9cbdb9d4dea34e3d18c20a"}}}
