{"name":"Neurai","id":"neurai","symbol":"xna","description":"What is the project about? Neurai aims to be a platform to enable harnessing the power of AI algorithms for efficient data analytics, predictive modeling, decision making and connectivity to IoT devices using blockchain assets. What makes your project unique? The project is based on the union of low-cost IoT devices that can be interconnected with the Neurai network and use AI APIs to take advantage of the network's assets. These devices can be easily acquired by anyone and that gives a decentralization to the project from the connectivity point of view. History of your project. The founders are experts in micro-electronics and looking for ways to connect IoT devices they saw that the best way was to create their own ecosystem from scratch and gradually build on it. Whatâ€™s next for your project? Find two or three RISC-V or ESP32 microcontrollers that will allow anyone to start using them. We will set up libraries and documentation to make it easy for anyone to use our blockchain using AI software designed for microcontrollers such as Tensorflow lite or TinyML. We will also create our own hardware wallet with camera and NFC, which will be used to sign transactions offline or even to manage IoT equipment. What can your token be used for? Neurai will be used as gas within the ecosystem and will also burn part of the coins as the various assets are used.","links":"https://neurai.org","market_cap":7712414,"market_cap_rank":1415,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/neurai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
