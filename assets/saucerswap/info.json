{"name":"SaucerSwap","id":"saucerswap","symbol":"sauce","description":"SaucerSwap is the leading decentralized exchange protocol on the Hedera network, implemented as a set of non-upgradable smart contracts focused on censorship resistance, security, and self-custody. SaucerSwap leverages the Hedera Token Service (HTS) for its rapid throughput and low-cost, U.S. dollar-denominated fee structure. Hedera's architecture ensures fair transaction ordering on SaucerSwap. This nullifies the possibility of MEV attacks seen in Ethereum-based protocols like Uniswap. The protocol has two iterations: SaucerSwap V1 operates as a constant product AMM, while V2 introduces concentrated liquidity for better capital efficiency. SAUCE, the native token of SaucerSwap, has multiple roles: Governance: SAUCE enables token holders to participate in the SaucerSwap DAO, voting on ecosystem-wide proposals such as protocol upgrades and incentive alignments. Liquidity: Governed by the Masterchef smart contract, SAUCE is used to incentivize liquidity in SaucerSwap V1 and V2. Staking: SAUCE holders can stake their tokens to earn a share of trading fees, HBAR staking rewards, and emissions through an automated buyback mechanism.
