{"name":"SALTMINECOIN","id":"saltminecoin_solana","symbol":"salt","description":"$SALT is a meme coin launched on the Solana network in April 2025 by developer @PrimitiveMoney as a playful experiment within the Bonk ecosystem. Initially created as a test with a total supply of 1 billion tokens, $SALT quickly gained momentum, reaching a 1 million USD market cap by April 27, 2025. @PrimitiveMoney donated proceeds, including 70 SOL from his wallet, to charity, and sold his stake to make the project fully community-driven. An additional 70 million tokens were burned, reducing the supply to 930 million. $SALT aims to bring fun, engagement, and a unique ‘salty’ vibe to the meme coin space, fostering a vibrant community through its ‘Mine Memes, Not Dreams’ ethos.","links":"https://saltminecoin.netlify.app/","market_cap":9070.87,"market_cap_rank":11380,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/saltminecoin_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"ENjwcWn1uUphWtvuP8ypjakr1jMHY9vnznXXrnMVbonk","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/ENjwcWn1uUphWtvuP8ypjakr1jMHY9vnznXXrnMVbonk"}},"is_native":false}
