{"name":"Auryn","id":"auryn_ethereum","symbol":"au","description":"Auryn (AU) is the deployment-sharing and value-accrual token for the Stablenet ecosystem. It is minted directly through the main dApp in exchange for ETH, TitanX, or ORX, and represents a stake in the expansion of independent USDx stablecoin deployments. Auryn connects the long-tail of low to mid-cap crypto assets to a unified MetaStable network, capturing value as new collateral types and communities adopt Stablenet’s stablecoin infrastructure. By acting as the shared token across future deployments, AU aligns ecosystem growth, collateral onboarding, and stablecoin adoption into a single asset.","links":"https://stablenet.tech/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/auryn/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x58d7fa7356d68c494c2de09f95d55c2ff2d38bd3","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x58d7fa7356d68c494c2de09f95d55c2ff2d38bd3"}},"is_native":false}
