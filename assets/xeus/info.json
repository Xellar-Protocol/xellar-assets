{"name":"XEUS","id":"xeus","symbol":"xeus","description":"XEUS is a decentralized reserve currency protocol based on the XEUS token. Each XEUS token is backed by a basket of assets (e.g. BUSD, DAI, LPs) in the XEUS treasury, giving it an intrinsic value that it cannot fall below. Xeus also introduces unique economic and game-theoretic dynamics into the market through staking and bonding.","links":"http://xeus.finance","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/xeus/logo.png"}
