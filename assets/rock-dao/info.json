{"name":"ROCK DAO","id":"rock-dao","symbol":"rock","description":"What is the project about? ROCK is a Web3 game token initiated by Gala Games in collaboration with Huobi and TRON. The total supply of ROCK is 5,973,780,169, of which 1.4 billion serves as the reserve fund of ROCK DAO, 0.7 billion held by Gala Games and Huobi each. 1.4 billion ROCK, as a reserve fund, will never enter the secondary market. It works as a governance token that gives holders voting rights. Gala Games also plans to connect with the Tron ecosystem and integrate ROCK with the GALA Games ecosystem. On the other side, Huobi is actively working to promote the interaction between Rock DAO and HT DAO for the mutual empowerment of the communities. Rock will work closely with Huobi and Gala Games to jointly explore the Web3 GameFi ecosystem, enrich the gaming experience, facilitate nodal cooperation and community governance. Gala Games is poised to launch memorial NFTs to ROCK holders exclusively while ROCK will be considered as a reward token in the Gala Games ecosystem. In addition, ROCK can be used to deduct commission fees in the NFT market. In 2023, the Gala Games public chain is set to launch, marking a significant milestone for Gala Film, Gala Music, and the entire Web3 GameFi ecosystem as they transfer onto the public chain. In this ecosystem, ROCK will assume a crucial role. What makes your project unique? History of your project. Whatâ€™s next for your project?
