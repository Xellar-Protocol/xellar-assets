{"name":"Rewardz® Network","id":"rewardz-network","symbol":"rayn","description":"What is the project about? The Rewardz® Network is a next-generation fiat onramp that is building for Base L2 centered around educational play-to-earn experiences that will teach users crypto prior to diving into the blockchain. What makes your project unique? They are led by a dev with a long history of building applications. They have ran a fair launch, no presales, stealth token launch and have built a very strong investor base as a utility brand in the middle of \"meme season\". RAYN will also be one of the first brands to launch on Base Layer-2 from Coinbase and are eagerly awaiting their mainnet launch. History of your project. RAYN was started as a trust network with a metric for gauging contractor \"credit\" and evolved over time. RAYN understands that most users come to crypto because of speculation or necessity. They want to tap the entertainment market and create a place where people come to have FUN on the blockchain. They intend to be a safe haven where crypto can be experience through well though out UI that finds common ground with tried and tested web2 user flows within the web3 structure. What’s next for your project? RAYN has already released staking and are working on an improved website and dApp UI ecosystem that will support their account abstraction smart wallets for users. What can your token be used for? The $RAYN token will be used throughout the RAYN platform. Within all games on the platform, all escrow work, mini-games, wagers, in-game store purchases will all require the $RAYN token.","links":"https://rewardz.network","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/rewardz-network/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x562d8e607bed7fc183ca84c0362c853680b99638"}}}
