{"name":"Erica Social Token","id":"erica-social-token","symbol":"est","description":"EST is social $ that will integrate the interactions and activities stemming from my community. As a community builder who has consistently tried to bridge the gap between regions and players through a variety of activities, I believe that the community has grown enough to create value and that community supporters need a way of being incentivized. Many useful cases in which you can use $EST will be created and announced in the upcoming months. You can use $EST in finding talent in Web3, getting access to events hosted by KryptoSeoul, getting access to exclusive content for $EST holders, scheduling exclusive meetings with Erica Kang, etc.","links":" https://ericaverse.eth.limo/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/erica-social-token/logo.png"}
