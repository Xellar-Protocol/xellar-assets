{"name":"Radiant Capital","id":"radiant-capital","symbol":"rdnt","description":"The New Central Bank of DeFi Capital in DeFi is extremely fragmented across chains, evidenced by the dozens of different money markets, all with their own liquidity. Radiant aims to be the first omnichain money market, where users can deposit any major asset on any major chain and borrow a variety of supported assets across multiple chains. Lenders who provide liquidity to Radiant will earn a passive income on the assets they deposit. Borrowers are able to withdraw against collateralized funds in order to obtain liquidity (working capital) without selling their assets and closing their positions. A New DeFi Primitive Radiant has been eight months in the making, as we strive to invent a new but very necessary DeFi primitive. As such, given the current state of alt L1s, Radiant will be launching v1 on what we believe to be the most secure and decentralized blockchain – Arbitrum. Radiant’s cross-chain interoperability will be built atop Layer Zero, with v1 leveraging Stargate’s stable router interface. Lenders who wish to reclaim their collateral will be able to direct which chain to withdraw funds to, and what percentage they’d like sent to each chain. Radiant focuses on core offerings that are resilient to oracle manipulation and leverages the $2M+ already spent in security audits executed by Layer Zero & Stargate. Radiant itself has been fully audited by Solidity Finance with a second audit near completion by Peckshield. Radiant v2 will allow for full cross-chain borrowing/lending on BTC, ETH and USDC, followed by the gradual rollout of additional assets voted on by the Radiant DAO. Welcome to an omnichain future.","links":"https://radiant.capital/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/radiant-capital/logo.png"}
