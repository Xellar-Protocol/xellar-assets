{"name":"Claw","id":"claw-2","symbol":"claw","description":"CLAW is a crypto token that has been created to offer a comprehensive solution to users of the Shibarium chain. Its primary objective is to provide an all-in-one wallet that simplifies and streamlines the process of transacting with cryptocurrencies. However, unlike other wallets in the market, CLAW is committed to preserving the privacy of its users. The CLAW wallet will allow users to conduct private transactions for $SHIB, $BONE, $LEASH, and $CLAW tokens. This feature has been introduced to address concerns regarding the lack of privacy in the cryptocurrency industry. By providing private transactions, CLAW will ensure that investors on the Shibarium chain can maintain their anonymity while carrying out transactions. The philosophy behind CLAW is that it's time to claw away transactions from the blockchain and take back privacy. In a world where personal data is increasingly becoming a valuable commodity, CLAW is committed to upholding the true essence of decentralization by providing a secure and private platform for its users.","links":"https://clawtools.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/claw-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x41b25ff6431074959532db7435dadaca65a21d1c"}}}
