{"name":"Kurumi","id":"kurumi-2_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"kurumi","description":"Kurumi, the White Shiba Inu memecoin on BSC, was abandoned by its developer post-launch. The community swiftly took over. With zero transaction taxes, trades incur no fees, supporting efficient buying and selling. The fixed 1 billion token supply avoids inflation. Management occurs via casual community chats on Telegram and X; at this moment there is no DAO, relying on organic consensus for marketing, exchange listings, and DeFi explorations. This setup promotes pure decentralization and holder-driven growth on BSC.","links":"https://www.kurumibnb.com","market_cap":1599311,"market_cap_rank":3197,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kurumi-2_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x44449eb99a54fb5f6de516ca4dc213602d50be33","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x44449eb99a54fb5f6de516ca4dc213602d50be33"}},"is_native":false}
