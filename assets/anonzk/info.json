Incognito is a privacy tool known as a mixer, which we developed to utilise zkSNARKs. It is a privacy-masking tool that allows users to send and receive cryptocurrencies anonymously, whilst keeping their identity and transaction history hidden. We announced our visa off-ramp options later today which we are aiming to be the first provider to accept Shibarium deposits, we're also creating our very own privacy based EVM compatible wallet. Which will combine our tools into the one place.","links":"https://anonzk.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/anonzk/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x5408245a4d7c685f59ce6d3b8b35916dd6c11a99"}}}
