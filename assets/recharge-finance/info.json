{"name":"Recharge Finance","id":"recharge-finance","symbol":"r3fi","description":"Recharge Finance is a yield generating, non-custodial ERC-20 token that requires no lockup and no gas to claim your rewards. Whether your tokens are stored in MetaMask, in your Hardware wallet or a titanium plate under your house foundations, they receive fees from each transaction. The R3FI token technology works by applying a 5% fee to each transaction and instantly splitting that fee among all holders of the token. Holders do not need to stake or wait for fees to be delivered. Fees are awarded by the smart contract and are immediately reflected in the holders balance.","links":"https://recharge.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/recharge-finance/logo.png"}
