The project aims to support the meme community, empower creators, and integrate meme culture into decentralized finance (DeFi). Bitmeme achieves this through platforms like MemeStarter (for launching meme coins), MemeFi (for staking and yield farming), MemeSwap (a DEX for meme coins), and MemeDEX (a meme-coin investment platform). By combining humor, blockchain technology, and community-driven initiatives, Bitmeme is creating a sustainable and engaging ecosystem that rewards participation and adoption of Web3 technologies.","links":"https://bitmeme.net/","market_cap":88962,"market_cap_rank":6802,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bitmeme-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"2XEm27fupa295SSXpmD8coakcFpCJn3huMsH5V77ZixP","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/2XEm27fupa295SSXpmD8coakcFpCJn3huMsH5V77ZixP"}}}
