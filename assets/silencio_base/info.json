{"name":"Silencio","id":"silencio_base","symbol":"slc","description":"Silencio powers voice AI, robotics, AR/VR, and spatial intelligence with ethically sourced, user-owned audio data at scale. With over 1.1 million users and >41 billion datapoints contributed, we are building the foundational layer for machine hearing. The market for real-world audio intelligence is projected to exceed $100 billion by 2030, fueled by virtual assistants, healthcare, robotics, and support systems. As demand for field data surges, Silencio is positioned as the go-to audio layer, capable of capturing any language, in any corner of the world. We transform everyday devices into a decentralized network of real-world audio sensors. Unlike traditional data models that extract information without consent, every datapoint is contributed voluntarily. Participation is always opt-in, anonymized, and rewarded, ensuring privacy and transparency. Silencio stands at the forefront of the Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) movement, setting new standards for community-driven data collection, transparency, and environmental impact.","links":"https://silencio.network/","market_cap":2835703,"market_cap_rank":2597,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/silencio_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6bd83abc39391af1e24826e90237c4bd3468b5d2","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x6bd83abc39391af1e24826e90237c4bd3468b5d2"}},"is_native":false}
