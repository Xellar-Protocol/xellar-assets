It powers a curated economic model that incentivizes both business growth and consumer adoption. The token bridges entertainment, blockchain utility, and business engagement, supporting OFiDCrypt’s Web3 Marketing & Media goods and services. The project introduces a three-part framework: • Bouncy Ball — Token Utility / E-Commerce: Facilitates transactions and incentivizes engagement. • #MicroEconomies — Pay Less, Grow More: Encourages consumers to grow alongside business performance. • Giddy’s — Consumer-Facing Brand & Storytelling: Offers family-fun products and animated adventures to build emotional and cultural relevance. OFiDCrypt uses storytelling and character-driven media (like Giddy Tales Adventures) to promote Web3 adoption and safety, while offering tangible savings through digital asset payments.","links":"https://www.ofidcrypt.com","market_cap":26103,"market_cap_rank":9263,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bouncy-ball-of-ofid-fun_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"GsKuLQsKCEnfQxuk4icTEQjc11Av8WiqW31CxZqZpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/GsKuLQsKCEnfQxuk4icTEQjc11Av8WiqW31CxZqZpump"}},"is_native":false}
