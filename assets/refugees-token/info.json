{"name":"Refugees","id":"refugees-token","symbol":"$rfg","description":"Launched in 06/06/2021 by a team based in Greece, Refugees Token is a charity project created to give Refugees the opportunity to send funds to their families through cryptocurrencies but also to give people the opportunity to help them through donations. Additionally using the application which is currently in the stage of development each transaction will have 1% tax that will go directly to the charity. Apart from the charity cause of the project, Refugees Token has been designed to be a deflationary token that rewards you with tokens simply for holding. Transactions have a 10% tax fee which is divided into 5% auto adding to liquidity and 5% distributed to holders and the burn address. Over 52% of the token's supply has been sent to the burn address from the beginning of the project","links":"https://www.refugeestoken.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/refugees-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x4477b28e8b797ebaebd2539bb24290fdfcc27807"}}}
