{"name":"Augmented Finance","id":"augmented-finance","symbol":"agf","description":"Augmented Finance (https://augmented.finance/) is a new DeFi liquidity protocol for high-yield lending and low-interest borrowing of digital assets. It is innovative, easy to use and maximizes the reward for its liquidity providers. Augmented Finance focuses on augmentation and intelligence as core capabilities: – It learns and evolves its behavior based on market activity by factoring in different parameters. One of the examples is dynamic interest rates. – It enables NFTs to be used in DeFi in various use cases, including using NFTs as collateral. Augmented Finance is engineered in a smart way to boost adoption: – High yields (APY) on major assets (USDC, USDT, DAI, WBTC, ETH) with accelerated yield farming. – 4x yield boost with automatic maximization for supply, borrow, stake via locking AGF token as per the mechanism proposed by Andre Cronje (similar to Curve’s mechanic of locking CRV for veCRV). – Robust tokenomics with powerful governance token. Backed by 200 agent-based simulations. AGF token has high utility and is used for various purposes: stake, boost yields on supplied/borrowed assets, get a share of treasury funds, and vote on DAO proposals and protocol parameters. – Fair launch: no pre-mine, no ICO. Almost all AGF tokens will be distributed to liquidity providers to incentivize protocol adoption and decentralize the governance. – High security. Non-custodial protocol with Chainlink oracle price feeds, 24/7 dedicated support, and security audit by PeckShield.","links":"https://augmented.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/augmented-finance/logo.png"}
