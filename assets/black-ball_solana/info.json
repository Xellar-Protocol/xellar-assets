{"name":"Black Ball","id":"black-ball_solana","symbol":"blackball","description":"BLACKBALL is a digital intelligence project designed to introduce adaptive AI behavior into modern software ecosystems. The project focuses on creating an intelligence layer that interacts with environments in real time, providing motion, clarity, and contextual responses. Instead of using static or pre-programmed systems, BLACKBALL’s framework enables applications to process signals dynamically, interpret changing conditions, and adjust outputs based on learned patterns. Its core objective is to support developers, platforms, and digital services in integrating responsive AI capabilities that enhance user interaction and automate complex tasks. By functioning as an intelligent node, BLACKBALL aims to improve system efficiency, increase data awareness, and enable more natural machine-to-environment communication across various digital infrastructures.","links":"https://black-ball.xyz/","market_cap":4555.42,"market_cap_rank":12489,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/black-ball/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"9xsF8KqQn7E8cwDS3jL45rZNDQJsCKatHgYH1KV1pump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/9xsF8KqQn7E8cwDS3jL45rZNDQJsCKatHgYH1KV1pump"}},"is_native":false}
