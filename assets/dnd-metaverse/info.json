{"name":"DnD Metaverse","id":"dnd-metaverse","symbol":"dndb","description":"D&D Metaverse is the first Dragons & Dungeons Gamefi with dynamic tokenomics.Players play and win to get BNB as rewards in PVE & PVP mode. Also you could create the Guild for your friends and defense the invaders. The Wonderland was built based on D20D3.5 Standard of Dragons & Dungeons.There are more than 10 heroes you can recruit for your adventure and with this done you can match on into the D&D world. In addition, we have built up a big-data dynamic balance system inside to balance the input and output resources in the tokenomics. For example, people pay for the DNDB as entry to join and play gamefi, but about 70% exchange BNB will return to game pool. So there will be a looper between the people and the game pool. Also, players should consider the heroes success rate and equipment this can really increase your reward prize","links":"https://www.dndmetaverse.live/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dnd-metaverse/logo.png"}
