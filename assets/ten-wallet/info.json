{"name":"TEN Wallet","id":"ten-wallet","symbol":"tenw","description":"TEN Wallet aims to builds a double-layered ring signature multi-chain wallet with zero knowledge proof integration. TEN Wallet will help people send funds fully privately which helps combat against malicious acts towards them. Additionally, it aims to stop the frontrunning done by bots as they will not be able to see the details of transactions due to privacy features. Currently, TEN Wallet has Smart Staking and Deflation System implemented. In the future, for each transaction a brand new wallet will be created and funds will be sent to the newly created wallet. Later, the funds will get sent to a first Mixer TEN Wallet pool which will be used to mix up the incoming transactions. To further enhance the security the mixed funds will get sent to the second Mixer TEN Wallet pool. As a final step, the brand new funds combination will be sent out as output to the Recipient.","links":"https://www.tenw.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ten-wallet/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x5132e359c9e784e339f803b9b73895335f3387cf"}}}
