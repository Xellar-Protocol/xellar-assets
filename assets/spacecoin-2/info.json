{"name":"Spacecoin","id":"spacecoin-2","symbol":"space","description":"Spacecoin is a satellite-based decentralized internet network that aims to provide reliable, permissionless connectivity across the globe. It is building a constellation of blockchain-enabled small satellites in low-Earth orbit to transmit data back to the Earth without heavily relying on traditional internet infrastructure such as cell towers and fiber-optic cables. The goal is to provide a reliable lifeline connection for the 2.6 billion people globally who have never connected to the Internet and an additional 3.5 billion who live with restricted access. Spacecoin plans to offer services in its target countries of Nigeria, Indonesia, and India for as low as $1-2 per month per user. The network works as an open system where anyone can add satellites. The first satellite launched in December 2024, with three more planned for October 2025.","links":"https://spacecoin.org/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/spacecoin-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
