The project focuses on providing an accessible gameplay experience while gradually introducing event-based mechanics tied to participation and performance. The $AGUSTO token supports in-game interactions, community events, and ecosystem participation rather than passive financial incentives. Agusto emphasizes entertainment, community involvement, and responsible development, with features and updates introduced progressively based on development milestones and user feedback","links":"https://agusto.org/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/agusto/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x59506187c2b67dd49b38f5589b1db114868d63e7","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x59506187c2b67dd49b38f5589b1db114868d63e7"}},"is_native":false}
