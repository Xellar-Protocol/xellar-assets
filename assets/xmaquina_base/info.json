{"name":"XMAQUINA","id":"xmaquina_base","symbol":"deus","description":"XMAQUINA is a decentralized ecosystem giving a global community liquid exposure to the world’s top private robotics companies developing next-generation humanoids and embodied AI. Just as MicroStrategy gave public markets early exposure to Bitcoin before it was broadly accessible, XMAQUINA brings the robotics revolution onchain. Until now, these opportunities were reserved for venture capital. $DEUS changes that. $DEUS is the governance and utility token at the heart of the ecosystem. It acts as a liquid index for the robot economy, giving holders access to a curated robotics portfolio and tokenized real-world machine assets. Members use the DAO Portal as a command center to manage proposals, guide treasury allocations, and coordinate the growth of the ecosystem. Deus Labs enables the community to participate in launching new ventures at the intersection of Web3 and robotics, while the Machine Economy Launchpad provides the infrastructure to co-own and scale Physical AI ventures. As robots begin to transform global industries, XMAQUINA ensures this future is not owned by the few but governed by the many.","links":"https://www.xmaquina.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/xmaquina_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x940a319b75861014a220d9c6c144d108552b089b","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x940a319b75861014a220d9c6c144d108552b089b"}},"is_native":false}
