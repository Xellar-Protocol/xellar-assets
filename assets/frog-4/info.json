{"name":"Frog","id":"frog-4","symbol":"frog","description":"FROG is a memecoin about friendship, inspired by old children's stories. He has a best friend called Toad and they go through life together. Frog is not Pepe, he's a unique character. The Frog NFT was a free mint for Frog community members. The FROG OS is the website custom-built for Frog that resembles a Windows-like OS. On the website, we've developed unique apps like \"Frogpad\" where users can write poetry and \"Frog Paint\" where they can draw. There are also entertainment apps like \"Frog Mp3 Player\" where they can listen to music and the \"Whack a Frog\" game where users have 2 minutes to rack up a high score.","links":"https://toadandfrog.com/","market_cap":90724,"market_cap_rank":6169,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/frog-4/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"sm6LoSiRQLM28rMgcd8GtR5XBkZFMEYXgEUgwCxpump"}}}
