{"name":"Pure Unadulterated Bliss","id":"pure-unadulterated-bliss","symbol":"pub","description":"$Pub is the facial expression one expresses when experiencing pure unadulterated bliss. It derives from 2chan from the early 2000's based on a character in a japanese manga. $Pub originated from the popular catchphrase meme “Yaranaika?” (Japanese: やらないか?), which translates to \"Shall we do it?\" This phrase comes from the opening dialogue of Kuso Miso Technique, a Geikomi manga drawn by Yamakawa Junichi. ​ ​​First published in 1987, Kuso Miso Technique appeared in the second issue of Barakomi, a Japanese gay-interest magazine. Subsequently, the manga evolved into a full-blown internet meme on sites like NND and 2channel, using the faces of the characters in the scene and repurposing and recontextualizing the drawing.","links":"https://www.pubcoin.fun/","market_cap":95370,"market_cap_rank":6180,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pure-unadulterated-bliss/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"AScrhkW2GohYy57rek2YVRc4J9UyXwmbAbEEKkoFpump"}}}
