{"name":"FX1Sports","id":"fx1sports","symbol":"fxi","description":"What is the project about? If Discord and ESPN had a web 3 child, that would be FX1. We are seeking to change the way sports streaming is consumed and paid for. What makes your project unique? We believe we're in a \"Spotify\" moment. Where billions are being lost every year to illegal sports streaming sites because fans are geo-locked, priced out and unhappy with modern day sports streaming. We are creating a next-gen social experience using AI, video chat, NFT pfps, marketplaces, collectibles, reward mechanisms, and a pay as you go model for sports viewership. Fandom will be rewarded and recognized with goodies and clout - something NO streaming platform is doing right now. History of your project. Been in development since 2019. Began community building earlier this year. Token launched few days ago. Now we're focusing on continuing the community building and platform development. Whatâ€™s next for your project? To grow our community and through token and NFT sales, bootstrap and self fund the entire creation of a potential multi billion dollar enterprise. We'd much rather share the development and ownership of our platform with web 3 folks rather than getting investors down the line as we are crypto enthusiasts ourselves and love the free market nature of the crypto world. What can your token be used for? Our token can be used for staking, paying for shows, donating to friends and or creators on FX1, purchase NFTs off our marketplace, upgrade your NFT Avatar on FX1, earn rewards and airdrops.","links":"https://fx1.io","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/fx1sports/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc5190e7fec4d97a3a3b1ab42dfedac608e2d0793"}}}
