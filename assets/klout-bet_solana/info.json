{"name":"klout.bet","id":"klout-bet_solana","symbol":"klout","description":"This project transforms social media engagement into a live trading experience by tokenising posts into dynamic markets. Each tweet becomes a tradeable asset powered by a bonding-curve mechanism that reacts to real-time engagement—likes, reposts, views, and comments. Users can buy and sell positions based on the virality potential of content, effectively enabling prediction markets around social engagement. The platform introduces a new asset class where social sentiment becomes liquidity. It bridges Web2 behaviours with Web3 trading incentives, allowing users to speculate on the performance of social content in a transparent, gamified and on-chain environment. This creates a new social-finance ecosystem driven by engagement, virality and market sentiment.","links":"https://klout.bet/","market_cap":5655.15,"market_cap_rank":12191,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/klout-bet/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"CeFrV65BuLHSsa4XGjaJau1af8Jr8e6Kxqc1iixwpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/CeFrV65BuLHSsa4XGjaJau1af8Jr8e6Kxqc1iixwpump"}},"is_native":false}
