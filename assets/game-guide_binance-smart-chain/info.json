{"name":"Game Guide","id":"game-guide_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"gg","description":"Game Guide ($GG) is a community-driven token and open template initiated by Adam, the developer of SURV, to demonstrate a streamlined approach to turning Web2 games into Web3 applications using the Idos Games platform. By leveraging real code, video documentation, and a playable demo (Survival.io), the guide walks developers through the full process of token integration, wallet connectivity, and on-chain game logic on BNB Chain. The aim is to show that launching a Web3 game no longer demands large development teams or venture capital — just practical tools, accessible infrastructure, and community support. $GG serves as both the utility and reward layer for experiments, incentives, and community-driven iterations. It’s a practical path into GameFi, built for builders.","links":"https://ggbnb.app/","market_cap":21637,"market_cap_rank":9630,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/game-guide/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x7d1aed70edde00feb46d70d8f74e8f9879bc0e36","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x7d1aed70edde00feb46d70d8f74e8f9879bc0e36"}},"is_native":false}
