{"name":"That's Iffy My Dude","id":"that-s-iffy-my-dude","symbol":"t.i.m.d","description":"Welcome to the land of indecision, where vibes matter more than utility and every pump is followed by a “maybe.” $IFFY is the Solana memecoin for people who say “probably,” “maybe,” or “ehhh” more than “yes.” Is it the next $DOGE? Could be. Is it just another rug? Possibly. Is it gonna moon? That’s iffy, my dude. With no roadmap, no promises, and definitely no utility, $IFFY thrives on the uncertainty that powers the degenerate soul. One minute we’re trending, the next we’re tweeting conspiracy theories about hamsters running validator nodes. Either way, it’s all vibes. So grab your bag (or don’t), flip a coin, consult your gut, and hop aboard the most questionable rocket in crypto.
