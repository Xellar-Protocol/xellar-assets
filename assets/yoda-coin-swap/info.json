The project is also focused on real usability, our token can be used for purchases and business in everyday life, and this is done through a partnership with a digital bank that besides issuing our debit cards will make the API integration with our platform, providing the option of payment in token or immediate conversion and payment in local currency.","links":"https://www.yodacoinswap.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/yoda-coin-swap/logo.png"}
