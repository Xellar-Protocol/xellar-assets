FRNT is the native governance token of the Final Frontier DAO, with many utilities such as DAO voting and community rewards and contests. On the Final Frontier website, viewers can read up on the distribution of funds and instructions on how to participate in the coming IDO. They have a detailed 31-page economics whitepaper that goes in-depth on the Tokenomics of FRNT, including Final Frontier's road map and business model. All founders and team members who received FRNT have already had their allocation of FRNT tokens locked up in a verifiable smart contract for two years, then vested afterwards for an additional two years.","links":"https://finalfrontiersa.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/final-frontier/logo.png"}
