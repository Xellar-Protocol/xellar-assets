{"name":"Pundi X NEM","id":"pundi-x-nem","symbol":"npxsxem","description":"Most of the Blockchain today is far from ideal, with an over-emphasis on technology and the under-emphasis on creating real use cases. Pundi X's philosophy is not only to build a technologically superior chain, but also one that has real-life application. A good Blockchain should have a user experience and performance that are way more superior than the current product in market. And thatâ€™s what we have achieved with our Blockchain called f(x). Currently, f(x) is already up and running on internal test environment. And we will continue to provide regular updates on the progress of f(x). We will walk the talk with f(x). It will be a game changer with real use cases to support it.","links":"https://pundix.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pundi-x-nem/logo.png"}
