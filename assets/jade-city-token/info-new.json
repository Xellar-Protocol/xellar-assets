{"name":"Jade City Token","id":"jade-city-token","symbol":"jct","description":"Jade City is the yield protocol layer for a company co-founded by the owners of the largest jade reserve in the world. Jade City democratizes access to the lucrative $50+ billion jade gemstone market by enabling community participation early in the jade value chain. Jade City, through its partners, buys, processes, and sells jade at a profit, distributing these profits to Jade City token holders ($JCT). Through a fully transparent, on-chain platform, users can participate by providing funds, in the form of a stablecoin, to fuel the movement of jade through the value chain. Participants are rewarded with high yields in physical jade while the remaining profits are distributed to $JCT holders via a buy and burn mechanism.","links":"https://jadecity.io","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/jade-city-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
