{"name":"Solanacorn","id":"solanacorn","symbol":"corn","description":"REAL UNICORN *nothing gram, fabricated equivalent of 1 nanogram of imaginary animal byproduct +Each token contains no less than 1 ng of unicorn kidney suspended in a proprietary blend of Yugoslavian chicken gizzards, North Korean virgin tears, and Appalachian \"meth head\" adrenaline gland extract (organic). ^Do not consume if you have an allergy to being based. Why $CORN? Despite claims from certain Swaps and Bots, our independent lab studies show that no real unicorn has ever been distributed on blockchain. We're here to change that. ​ Will I actually receive unicorn after purchasing the token? No, you will not receive parts of an imaginary magical creature after purchasing this token. However, we do GUARANTEE you that $CORN token is as real as any other token in your cryptocurrency wallet! ​ Where does the $CORN come from? All $CORN originated from our founder, Charlie (see more here). Like horses, unicorn kidneys weigh 500-700g. Charlie's 694.20g kidney was stolen by Candy Mountain in 2005. Thanks to recent geopolitical events and clinical-grade hallucinogens, we were able to acquire his kidney and magically inscribe it on to the Ethereum blockchain. Each $CORN token corresponds to 1 nanogram of desiccated unicorn kidney.","links":"https://www.solanacorn.xyz/","market_cap":2571606,"market_cap_rank":2935,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/solanacorn/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":7,"contract_address":"6DSqVXg9WLTWgz6LACqxN757QdHe1sCqkUfojWmxWtok"}}}
