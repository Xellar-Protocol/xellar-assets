{"name":"Bore supply","id":"bore-supply_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"bore","description":"BORE is an on-chain mining protocol and strategy game built on BNB Chain Players compete in fast-paced rounds by deploying BNB across a 7×3 grid of 21 validators, a layout inspired by the 21 core validators (Cabinet) that secure BNB Chain. New $BORE tokens are minted and distributed to miners on the winning validator, while BNB deployed on losing validators is redistributed to winners. In parallel, a Motherlode pool and a refining mechanism reward longer-term and more patient miners, and a staking system allows holders to benefit from protocol revenue via buybacks. Design Goals Fair & transparent One winning validator is chosen using a verifiable random function oracle on BNB Chain (Binance VRF). Simple, capped tokenomics Fixed maximum supply, no insider/team allocation, and programmatic emissions. Aligned incentives Active miners earn $BORE and BNB, long-term holders benefit from refining and buyback-driven staking rewards.","links":"https://www.bore.supply/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bore-supply/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xbf8aeaacd60cfd3cc58ef46dcc382c2de1cb3df1","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xbf8aeaacd60cfd3cc58ef46dcc382c2de1cb3df1"}},"is_native":false}
