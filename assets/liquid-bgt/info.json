It simplifies and automates PoL interactions for participants, enabling them to unlock the full potential of Berachain’s governance token, BGT, in a decentralized and user-friendly manner. At its core, BeraPaw transforms Berachain’s native yield-bearing token, BGT, into a more versatile and liquid asset called Liquid BGT (LBGT).","links":"https://berapaw.com","market_cap":3396570,"market_cap_rank":2739,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/liquid-bgt/logo.png","detail_platform":{"berachain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xbaadcc2962417c01af99fb2b7c75706b9bd6babe","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/berachain/tokens/0xbaadcc2962417c01af99fb2b7c75706b9bd6babe"}}}
