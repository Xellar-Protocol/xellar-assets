{"name":"KITA","id":"kita_base","symbol":"$kita","description":"In a time where meme tokens dominate Base and Ethereum traffic, KITA offers a structured path forward. The project draws inspiration from anime, glitch aesthetics, and AI mythos to create a compelling brand while solving a key infrastructure gap: easy, on-chain token launches with built-in utility for a native token. Through the KITA Next Terminal, creators can fully customize their token — including setting the initial market cap, total supply, swap fees, and liquidity configuration — all within a streamlined interface.","links":"https://kitawaifu.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kita_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe0f3e8ac4774a3b0bb4c5554b8e888f4d57edf71","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xe0f3e8ac4774a3b0bb4c5554b8e888f4d57edf71"}},"is_native":false}
