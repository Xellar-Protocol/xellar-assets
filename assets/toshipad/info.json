{"name":"ToshiPad","id":"toshipad","symbol":"tshx","description":"ToshiPad is built to fill an unanswered niche in BRC20s: A launchpad that focuses on the incubation and long-term success of launched projects. ToshiPad exclusively launches projects with long-term upwards potential and we ensure their success through dedicated, professional incubation and support services. Additionally, each launched project becomes an integral part of The Council Ecosystem, establishing linked value-flows with the other projects in the ecosystem. This creates rolling momentum that pushes value backwards towards all holders of prior ecosystem projects while helping stabilize floor pricing for new projects. These “Spiral Value Mechanics” create a massive incentive to engage with and hold tokens in our ecosystem. Core utilities: - Access token for primier BRC20 Projects on Launchpad - Over 50% of tokens utilized in grants to be issued to builders to add additional value and utilities to TSHX - TSHX token provides you access to projects launching on Toshipad launchpad","links":"https://toshipad.com","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/toshipad/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ordinals":{"decimal_place":0,"contract_address":"baf5846b18269e4a17c872b61ee9a89a402419a682421b00059a79814fd7e5cbi0"}}}
