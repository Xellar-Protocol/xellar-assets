Jolyne is righteous and values her family and friends. She would selflessly do everything in her power to help her people in need. Just like Jolyne Cujoh, JOJO’s Adventure was launched with a dream to bring alongside the community towards a vision of fairness and sustainable growth. The aim to protect the integrity of it’s holders by creating a contract that cannot be compromised, ensuring it’s security & safety. JOJO’s Adventure was designed to be a micro-supply tokens with only 10000 created and only 2500 tokens in circulation having locked 7500 tokens for 177 years. This makes the JOJO token a scare, appreciating asset with the highest growth potential. Jolyne Cujo's greatest asset is her imagination. In line with this, JOJO’s Adventure will release an NFT Marketplace to enable an equal-access platform, showcasing only original anime-style art from premiere artists around the world.
