Z³’s foundation is their innovative Proof-of-Holdings auto-mining consensus, developed as a zero emission alternative to PoW and PoS mining protocols. Z³ has several utilities on their roadmap, all of which align with the goal of improving the DeFi space for investors of all levels, and which lay the groundwork for a broad suite of products. First among them, Z³ will be leveraging the power of decentralization through their CUBEDAO³, empowering its holders to drive project decision-making. The DAO will be closely followed by the launch and implementation of Zev³, a product that promises unparalleled improvements to accessibility, safety, and security.
