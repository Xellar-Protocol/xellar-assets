{"name":"Nest Elixir Vault (LP)","id":"nest-elixir-vault-lp_ethereum","symbol":"inelixir","description":"Nest's mission is to build a global, permissionless, onchain economy where anyone can earn from real world yields. Nest is the flagship staking protocol of the Plume RWAfi ecosystem, with a permissionless product that enables anyone to earn institutional-grade APYs from real world assets. Through Nest, fund managers and asset issuers can create new financial instruments by curating vaults. Each vault contains various streams of yield derived from onchain and offchain real world assets. Users can enter and exit each vault, managing and trading their ERC-20 vault tokens permissionlessly, and independently of the underlying streams of yield. Nest Elixir Vault brings Elixir's deUSD yield-bearing token to Nest. deUSD is DeFi's only dollar serving as the rails for institutional assets to natively enter DeFi. Yield emissions from Elixir are earned from a mix of treasuries and funding yield. Blackrock BUIDL and Hamilton Lane SCOPE holders can also natively mint deUSD and deposit.","links":"https://app.nest.credit/nest-elixir-vault","market_cap":14.64,"market_cap_rank":13169,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nest-elixir-vault-lp_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0xd3bfd6e6187444170a1674c494e55171587b5641","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xd3bfd6e6187444170a1674c494e55171587b5641"}},"is_native":false}
