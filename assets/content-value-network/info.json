By adopting the VRF consensus main chain plus the PoST consensus, it creates a more resource-saving and efficient decentralized storage system. Meanwhile, CVN uses ZK Rollup and State Channels to provide a low-cost, high-throughput Layer 2 solution. It also builds a Layer 2 validator node, to better ensure the efficiency and security of Layer 2.","links":"http://cvn.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/content-value-network/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"0x6400b5522f8d448c0803e6245436dd1c81df09ce"}}}
