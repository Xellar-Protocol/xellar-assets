{"name":"TWIN Asset Token iNVDA Short","id":"twin-asset-token-invda-short","symbol":"invda","description":"TWIN Finance is a decentralized finance protocol for synthetic derivatives of real-world assets on blockchain. Its distinct long & short “twin-token” method enables the creation of synthetic assets that reflect the price of a real-world asset or crypto equivalent. This method offers high capital efficiency without requiring over-collateralization or exposure to the risk of liquidation. For liquidity providers, this twin-token approach substantially minimizes price risks, bringing them near to stable-coin levels.","links":"https://app.twinfinance.io","market_cap":13034.84,"market_cap_rank":10542,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/twin-asset-token-invda-short/logo.png","detail_platform":{"berachain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x3a4b2d07c237c701c68238da07e11302353a16f1","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/berachain/tokens/0x3a4b2d07c237c701c68238da07e11302353a16f1"}}}
