{"name":"Vernus","id":"vernus_solana","symbol":"ver","description":"Vernus was built to address systemic challenges in media we know all too well: algorithmic feeds, subscription fatigue, not to mention the ever-increasing presence of AI slop. Vernus is a human-first perspective on the future of content distribution. Celebrate human creation with verifiable origins, programmable payments, and privacy‑preserving authenticity. Discover ideas, pay once, forget doomscrolling. Fair one-time payments for quality content. Discovery driven by wisdom, curiosity, and genuine value. Not engagement metrics. Heartbeats beat bits. Always. Vernus ensures that what you read originates from a human mind, a living heartbeat behind every idea. AI derivatives like text-to-speech or accessibility formats are welcome. But the source must be human. Vernus Pay, times 402. Making use of the power of x402, Vernus is evolving into a decentralised media payment platform. Value flows at the speed of stories. Platforms will be able to integrate Vernus, and people can create profiles to accept tips and direct payments via Vernus — per post, per series, or per collaboration. Privacy & Journalism Proof of humanity shouldn’t require revealing your identity. Vernus separates identity from authenticity, so sources and writers can remain private while still being trusted. Journalism is often an endangered profession. Vernus helps verify authorship and originality while protecting privacy, enabling safer reporting and whistleblowing without sacrificing credibility.","links":"https://vernus.one","market_cap":23023,"market_cap_rank":9506,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/vernus/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"DL7JgzgcJLudqJAVTXWyNizT9p9Rk5kxT4bWKUwcpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/DL7JgzgcJLudqJAVTXWyNizT9p9Rk5kxT4bWKUwcpump"}},"is_native":false}
