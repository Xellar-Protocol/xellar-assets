{"name":"Blue Signing Token","id":"blue-signing-token_solana","symbol":"bst","description":"Blue Signing ($BST) is a project aiming to transform how digital documents are signed and validated by combining Web2 and Web3 technologies, with a strong focus on digital identity, blockchain, and user experience. The proposed ecosystem integrates advanced electronic signatures, digital certificates, Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), all within a framework that aspires to legal alignment and international scalability. As part of this vision, the $BST (Blue Signing Token) was created on the Solana network as the first foundational component of the decentralized ecosystem. Its utility is intended to support participation, foster strategic partnerships, and offer benefits tied to long-term engagement—aligned with the project’s progressive development. Blue Signing originated from a real-world need: to improve the security, traceability, and control of digital signature processes. The project brings together research, technological design, and legal validation to build an adaptable platform focused on white-label models and applicable to areas like contract management, onboarding processes, and digital notarization. The project places strong emphasis on community participation as a key driver of its evolution, with the goal of building new ways to establish trust in digital environments—driven by purpose, collaboration, and a long-term sustainable vision.","links":"https://www.bluesigning.com/","market_cap":13712.35,"market_cap_rank":10526,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/blue-signing-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"VjMa3mzfBgCyKRTQHg8pSuZRKCvKF8zMqVXQMU3pump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/VjMa3mzfBgCyKRTQHg8pSuZRKCvKF8zMqVXQMU3pump"}},"is_native":false}
