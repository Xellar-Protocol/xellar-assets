{"name":"DENTNet","id":"dentnet","symbol":"dentx","description":"DENTNet is a global blockchain for telecommunication assets to tokenize the wireless world, such as mobile data and eSIM infrastructure. The network runs on a Nominated Proof of Stake consensus mechanism and implements telco-specific concepts like operator sponsorship and asset expiry. Since the '90s, each mobile network operator has run its own software for accounting, subscription management, traffic management, etc. Now, many of these services can be provided by a single platform - DENTs global telco blockchain. This will help operators and enterprises to automate processes, reduce costs, and speed up innovation. DENTNet will be used by mobile operators and their partners such as enterprises, resellers, service providers, and end customers as well. DENTX is the native unit of exchange on DENTNet, similar to ETH on Ethereum or BTC on the Bitcoin network. DENTX is used to pay fees such as transaction fees and stake for the security of the network.","links":"https://www.dentnet.io","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dentnet/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":null}}}
