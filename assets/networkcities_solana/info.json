{"name":"NETWORKCITIES","id":"networkcities_solana","symbol":"cities","description":"This is the Network Cities coin. Network Cities is a social city builder game. The first city‑builder where your X network literally powers your metropolis. BUILD 🏗️ Lay out homes, factories & infrastructure that unlock real‑time growth. Essential‑service dependencies keep upgrades strategic. TRADE 🤝 Use in‑game marketplaces & guild contracts to swap resources with friends and followers; future phases add supply‑demand markets, futures & direct purchases. GROW 🌱 Every new citizen is someone from your X graph. Share a city screenshot, tag a friend, and they appear as a happy resident, boosting both cities’ yields. Roadmap • Phase 1 – Foundation: core build/upgrade loop, resource gifting, simple progression. • Phase 2 – Social Expansion: network‑wide trading hubs, specialized guilds, collaborative megaprojects. • Phase 3 – Advanced Ecosystem: full social economy with futures, tokenized assets, & city DAOs. 👷‍♂️ Built by Anshul Dhawan (ex‑Zynga (poker), Glu(Electronic Arts)) with 15 yrs in game & AI product leadership.","links":"https://networkcities.fun/","market_cap":218173,"market_cap_rank":5787,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/networkcities/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"B45FhPi6d7UR66TGLpQ3EPnWhGfzdGVkCKNp9neR5Cxt","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/B45FhPi6d7UR66TGLpQ3EPnWhGfzdGVkCKNp9neR5Cxt"}},"is_native":false}
