{"name":"Volta Club","id":"volta-club","symbol":"volta","description":"Volta is the token that represents the Volta Club protocol. With a maximum and total supply of 1,000,000, it has been transitioned from the deprecated wMEMO, the native token of Wonderland DAO, at a 1:330 rate. As Wonderland undergoes rebranding, both tokens will be supported for the near future. However, Volta will be the sole officially supported token and will be used as the protocol's native token.","links":"https://volta.club/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/volta-club/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x9b06f3c5de42d4623d7a2bd940ec735103c68a76"},"factom":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x9b06f3c5de42d4623d7a2bd940ec735103c68a76"},"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x9b06f3c5de42d4623d7a2bd940ec735103c68a76"},"avalanche":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x9b06f3c5de42d4623d7a2bd940ec735103c68a76"}}}
