{"name":"REM Token","id":"rem-token_base","symbol":"rem","description":"The Real Estate Metaverse (REM) is a blockchain-powered real estate investment platform that enables users to gain fractional ownership of high-quality real estate properties. REM democratizes access to real estate investments by utilizing the ERC3643 token standard, which allows for the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA), making real estate more accessible, transparent, and liquid. Through the REM platform, users can invest in global real estate properties with minimal capital, earn passive income through rental yields, and benefit from potential capital appreciation. The project aims to eliminate traditional barriers in the real estate market, such as high capital requirements, limited liquidity, and geographic restrictions.","links":"https://www.remmeta.ai/","market_cap":167388,"market_cap_rank":6189,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/rem-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x83d5d441ed15737d34226b682f7427d2217f2a8f","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x83d5d441ed15737d34226b682f7427d2217f2a8f"}},"is_native":false}
