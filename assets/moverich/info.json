{"name":"MoveRich","id":"moverich","symbol":"mvrc","description":"MoveRich is designed so that all ecosystem participants can participate with maximum motivation. The basis of MoveRich tokenomics is that when each participant and ecosystem member assume their role and operate or use it, real economic and nominal benefits are given to everyone. In addition, it should be designed so that new goods or economic values generated through this can be circulated in the ecosystem and developed in the long term. For this, MoveRich does not use the existing database-driven system, but perfectly records the activities of all participants through the blockchain Ethereum ERC20, and without data loss or forgery, The framework is structured so that the reward designed by passing it to each node can be accurately implemented and paid out. In the MoveRich platform, there are three main groups: users, service providers, and institutional carbon-neutral organizations. You can earn high rewards and protect the environment by exercising every day, generating profit by advertising your product on the platform, or distributing the economic benefits as coins to offset greenhouse gases. You will be able to make a significant contribution to environmental protection by using it for purchase.","links":"http://moverich.io/index_eng.html","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/moverich/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa291b47efe802de81ac425c67d2b8d2925fa31a4"}}}
