{"name":"ClayStack Staked MATIC","id":"claystack-staked-matic","symbol":"csmatic","description":"ClayStack is a highly secure liquid staking protocol that unlocks the capital efficiency of staked assets in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks. It does that by issuing derivative tokens for every stake-able token that users deposit thus removing the need for users to lock their capital within the network to earn staking rewards. These tokens are known as csTokens, and they: a) are fully backed by the original tokens and b) increase in value over time as staking rewards accrue in these tokens. Since they are fully backed by the underlying staked tokens, they can be freely used as capital across the entire DeFi ecosystem.","links":"https://claystack.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/claystack-staked-matic/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x38b7bf4eecf3eb530b1529c9401fc37d2a71a912"},"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xfcbb00df1d663eee58123946a30ab2138bf9eb2a"}}}
