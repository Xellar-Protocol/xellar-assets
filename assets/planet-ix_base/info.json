{"name":"Planet IX","id":"planet-ix_base","symbol":"aix","description":"Planet IX is an NFT-based strategy game, and your goal is to restore a fallen planet to its former green-blue glory while uncovering its mysteries. The story is continuously expanding into a huge and immersive sci-fi metaverse, and the narrative is tailored towards bringing awareness of humanity's impact on the world of today. The Planet IX map consists of 1.6 billion PIX, all being individual NFTs that you can collect. The PIX are acquired using our own ERC-20 utility token called IX Token (IXT) which was launched on Polygon November 20, 2021. Today, the game has a dedicated community with high engagement, with 190k+ UAWs and 400+ million NFTs sold to date and we are now migrating to base chain. As you progress in the game, you can form territories, develop new technology, raid other players, and gain ownership of in-game corporations with different functions and perks. Everything you collect has true ownership, and your mission is simple. Collect assets, use them wisely, and build the word of tomorrow. The game incorporates a big sustainability aspect, where players are increasingly able to have positive effects on the real world through their in-game actions.","links":"https://planetix.com/","market_cap":21572353,"market_cap_rank":1072,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/planet-ix_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x920e753d8d7d5b598063c89b6f06288803448d06","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x920e753d8d7d5b598063c89b6f06288803448d06"}},"is_native":false}
