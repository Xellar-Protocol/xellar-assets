{"name":"2044 Nuclear Apocalypse","id":"2044-nuclear-apocalypse","symbol":"2044","description":"2044 will provide a destination for its players to live, interact, and flourish. Taking you from the gateway into the metaverse, together with 2044, to a fully ubiquitous web3 experience—to the point where when you take off your VR headset, you won’t be able to tell what’s real and what’s not. We have been debating whether or not people want to be themselves in the metaverse, or some futuristic version of themselves, ever since we started working on this project. Although there isn't a single proper solution to overlay on the majority, it is obvious that the only other choice at the moment is to enter the metaverse as a cartoon or a poorly edited version of oneself based on unrecognizable attributes. Our team at 2044 has set out to provide everyone who is interested in a highly realistic representation of the metaverse exactly what they want. 2044 is aiming to be the most hyper-realistic play-to-earn verse across the entire landscape of the metaverse.","links":"https://2044.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/2044-nuclear-apocalypse/logo.png"}
