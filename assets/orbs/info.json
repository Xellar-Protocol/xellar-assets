{"name":"Orbs","id":"orbs","symbol":"orbs","description":"Orbs was built to bridge the unoccupied gap between the functionality of a public blockchain with the ironclad security of a private one. In a time where people are trusting major companies less than ever before, those enterprises can, at best, ask users to trust them.
