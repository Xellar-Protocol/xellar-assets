{"name":"N GameFi","id":"n-gamefi_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"n","description":"N GameFi is a decentralized gaming ecosystem designed to integrate play-to-earn mechanics with sustainable tokenomics. The project introduces a native token that is used for in-game transactions, leaderboard rewards, and community-driven governance. Unlike speculative meme tokens, N GameFi emphasizes real use cases, including game participation, prize distribution, and player-to-player economy. The token contract includes features such as adjustable transaction fees to support liquidity, development, and community rewards. These mechanisms are not controlled by a single entity but are subject to community governance, ensuring transparency and fairness. The project’s purpose is to bridge traditional gaming and blockchain by enabling developers to integrate their games into the ecosystem while allowing players to earn and use tokens seamlessly.","links":"https://nnnnn.fun","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/n-gamefi/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0xb82582bf335bc4f57ec3c536e67019e1fa263f81","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xb82582bf335bc4f57ec3c536e67019e1fa263f81"}},"is_native":false}
