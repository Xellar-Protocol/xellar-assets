Unlike many communities that revolve around a single protocol, DFGC embraces a multi-project philosophy, encouraging innovation across a wide range of decentralized applications. Our community includes experienced developers, designers, researchers, and supporters who collaborate to create open-source, transparent, and community-governed tools. DFGC is not limited to developers—we welcome anyone passionate about contributing to the decentralized future, whether through ideas, design, operations, or outreach.","links":"https://defigeek.xyz/","market_cap":1834161,"market_cap_rank":3060,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/defigeek-community-japan/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"0x961dd84059505d59f82ce4fb87d3c09bec65301d","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x961dd84059505d59f82ce4fb87d3c09bec65301d"}},"is_native":false}
