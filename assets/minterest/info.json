{"name":"Minterest","id":"minterest","symbol":"minty","description":"MINTY is the main token used by Minterest in its protocol for rewards and governance. A portion of MINTY is distributed by the lending and borrowing protocol, Minterest for the repayment of all the fees in the platform: Supply & Borrow, Flash Loans & Liquidations. The token is then used to pay its users through a slow drip smart contract that ensures the tokens long term sustainability and scarcity as per our revised tokenomics. Additionally the Buyback program buys MINTY in the open market to also reward those who stake MINTY and participate in governance (at least once in 6 months).","links":"https://minterest.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/minterest/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x149cac67f1cd5d80651e7c9bb359ec285d821a05","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x149cac67f1cd5d80651e7c9bb359ec285d821a05"},"mantle":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x5ecdb76feda945dc71f7d9ce62dfe7eafefffab4","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/mantle/tokens/0x5ecdb76feda945dc71f7d9ce62dfe7eafefffab4"},"taiko":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x2bd26ba2ef62ff90f807365c2bf363fb3bee9979","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/taiko/tokens/0x2bd26ba2ef62ff90f807365c2bf363fb3bee9979"},"tomochain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xbb0209e02b3cc33ef00321e8d20b78ca1cdcc8a0","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/tomochain/tokens/0xbb0209e02b3cc33ef00321e8d20b78ca1cdcc8a0"}}}
