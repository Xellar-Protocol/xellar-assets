{"name":"Astherus","id":"astherus_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"astherus","description":"Astherus is a community-driven memecoin on BNB Smart Chain with documented historical ties to the AsterDEX ecosystem. The token originated as the first brand iteration of AsterDEX, with the name \"Astherus\" embedded in the platform's login interface and contract structure. After the original developer exited in September 2025, followed by large holder liquidations, the remaining community members initiated a complete takeover and restructured the project under decentralized management. The project operates without centralized leadership, with all strategic decisions made through community consensus. Astherus functions as a cultural identity token for the BNB Chain ecosystem, positioning itself as a native meme asset with verifiable on-chain heritage rather than purely speculative branding.","links":"https://astherus.name","market_cap":988524,"market_cap_rank":3769,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/astherus/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x39aea3d999eddbfbe73015b9b274cb912a144444","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x39aea3d999eddbfbe73015b9b274cb912a144444"}},"is_native":false}
