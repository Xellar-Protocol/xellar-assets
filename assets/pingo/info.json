{"name":"PinGo","id":"pingo","symbol":"pingo","description":"PinGo - the first AI+DePIN project on the TON network, redefining the way we access computational resources, datasets, and artificial intelligence. PinGo serves as a medium that bridges idle computing power, effectively addressing the problem of fragmented and idle resources. By leveraging AI, DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure), and Decloud solutions, PinGo provides a robust computing power foundation for building AI models. Our platform integrates these technologies to optimize and democratize access to essential computational resources, driving innovation and efficiency in machine learning applications.","links":"https://pingo.work/","market_cap":4589716,"market_cap_rank":2433,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pingo/logo.png","detail_platform":{"the-open-network":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"EQCRWpQQmfSglpLp6D5Xebix50AStBxjfQQNkssFP_IsiQc3","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/ton/tokens/EQCRWpQQmfSglpLp6D5Xebix50AStBxjfQQNkssFP_IsiQc3"}}}
