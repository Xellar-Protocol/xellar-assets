{"name":"Web3 Forensics","id":"web3-forensics","symbol":"w3f","description":"Web3 Forensics are building tools and data aimed to provide better crypto forensics on multi-chains. Our first tool is what we are calling a Token Image Visualizer [TIV] which will let users see if the token they are looking to invest in has a unique image. We have already catalogued over 120K token images and continue to add 300-400 daily to our database. We aim to provide a free service to end users and a paid API service to businesses and developers wanting to leverage our enriched data. Our token W3F will be usable to subscribe to our API's at a massive discount compared to fiat currency, making it a logical choice to buy and use.","links":"https://www.web3forensics.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/web3-forensics/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"GcMxvf5dJH8sYDKKEcPPBePfzxEYR1FXe8mxiWwWrUDt"}}}
