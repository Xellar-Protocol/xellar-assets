{"name":"UNIT DAO","id":"unit-dao","symbol":"un","description":"The UNIT runs an algorithm that tracks the market to put together a self-updating basket of cryptocurrencies with the most important human metrics to create a benchmark for the future financial system. As USD pairs and charts become more irrelevant, the UNIT takes the role of pricing in the new era. To engage with UNIT, we created a flatcoin peg named TINU. With TINU you can trade Bitcoin dominance through the BTC/TINU pair. Even inexperienced investors can hold TINU to get exposure to the most important part of the cryptocurrency market without needing to research individual coins. As an indexed unit, UNIT through its ETF TINU can be used to trade the market share of cryptocurrencies, not only bitcoin dominance. This makes UNIT a true long-term asset, a flatcoin or inflation hedge, and a powerful force to unite the space of many blockchains with a decentralized unbiased unit.","links":"https://unitindex.org/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/unit-dao/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x93109af5638be68ed2d0e094f618777ff1051d28"}}}
