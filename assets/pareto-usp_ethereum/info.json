{"name":"Pareto USP","id":"pareto-usp_ethereum","symbol":"usp","description":"Pareto USP is a synthetic dollar protocol soft-pegged to stablecoins backed by real-world institutional-grade private credit, alongside a globally accessible savings asset, sUSP. Users mint USP by depositing stablecoins, e.g. USDC, USDS, into the USP contract. The contract mints USP and deposits the underlying assets into Credit Vaults. Credit Vaults lend assets to institutional players that perform yield strategies to generate yield later distributed to USP stakers, i.e., sUSP holders.","links":"https://pareto.credit/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pareto-usp/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x97ccc1c046d067ab945d3cf3cc6920d3b1e54c88","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x97ccc1c046d067ab945d3cf3cc6920d3b1e54c88"}},"is_native":false}
