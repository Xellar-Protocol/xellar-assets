{"name":"Lightspeed to the Moon!","id":"lightspeed-to-the-moon_base","symbol":"moon","description":"MOON is a creator token launched on Zora’s Base-chain infrastructure that converts creative media into a tradable ERC-20 asset. Using Zora’s coin framework, individual pieces of content such as videos or media posts can be tokenized with built-in liquidity, allowing users to buy, sell, or trade the token freely on-chain without relying on centralized platforms. For MOON, the project is centered around a video that serves as a symbolic “call to action” for the broader Lightspeed creator ecosystem. The content emphasizes momentum, participation, and collective movement rather than passive consumption. By tokenizing the video as MOON, the project enables community members to directly engage with and support the message through ownership and trading of the token itself. MOON’s purpose and function combine multiple elements: Creative content tokenization: the video is transformed into a tradable on-chain asset rather than remaining static media. Community participation mechanism: holders can acquire MOON to signal alignment with the project’s direction and narrative. Ecosystem signaling: the token represents an expression of forward momentum within the Lightspeed creator environment, reinforcing participation and visibility through on-chain activity. In this way, MOON functions as both a creative artifact and a participation token, linking symbolic media with transparent, on-chain ownership and market dynamics.","links":"https://zora.co/mr_lightspeed","market_cap":261809,"market_cap_rank":5529,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/lightspeed-to-the-moon/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x3ad8539cf0e010c77d276fb197061ac613511cae","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x3ad8539cf0e010c77d276fb197061ac613511cae"}},"is_native":false}
