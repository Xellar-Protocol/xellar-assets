{"name":"Acid","id":"acid","symbol":"acid","description":"What is the project about? 0xACID is a protocol that aims to maximize the return on LSD assets (such as stETH, rETH, frxETH, etc.) and provide a much higher return than ordinary LSD assets (which typically only have 4-5% APR). It will have a significant impact on the entire Ethereum L1 and L2 with the increasing of treasury ETH-related assets. The protocol holds LSD-related assets (equivalent to long-term bullish on ETH) and continuously earns real income from Ethereum nodes. The protocol values are all denominated in ETH, focusing only on ETH growth, as we firmly believe that ETH will reach above $10,000 in the near future. What makes your project unique? Unleash the true power of LSD,Bringing maximum LSD yield profits to 0xAcid holders with our innovative revenue models.
