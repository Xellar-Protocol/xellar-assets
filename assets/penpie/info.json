This mechanism gives PENDLE holders the chance to earn high APR% by converting their tokens into mPENDLE at a 1:1 ratio. What can your token be used for? PNP is the governance and revenue-sharing token of Penpie. Users can lock their PNP tokens on Penpie to receive vlPNP at a 1:1 ratio. vlPNP is the locked version of the PNP token.","links":"https://www.pendle.magpiexyz.io/stake","market_cap":13952987,"market_cap_rank":1352,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/penpie/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x7dedbce5a2e31e4c75f87fea60bf796c17718715"},"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x2ac2b254bc18cd4999f64773a966e4f4869c34ee"},"optimistic-ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc4a65a93dd6cd9717551ebe827e8baee025d1d7e"},"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x5012c90f14d190607662ca8344120812aaa2639d"}}}
