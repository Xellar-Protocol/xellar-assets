When the Buy-Back function is turned on, the contract automatically Buys Back and Burns Tokens after each sell. For the first time ever, you don’t need to claim your earned BNB. It’s automatically sent to your wallet every 60 minutes. The biggest BNB reflection token and the only one with auto-claim feature. Simply hold $BRISE tokens in your wallet and you’ll earn BNB. BitRise Payment System ( Under Development ) BitRise Token will be used as peer-to-peer (P2P) service for payment systems using our dApp wallet in the local currency with zero transaction fees, faster & secure transactions, whereby two individuals interact directly with each other, without intermediation by a third party. Instead, the buyer and the seller transact directly with each other via the P2P service.","links":"https://bitgert.com/","market_cap":54478974,"market_cap_rank":822,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bitrise-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x8fff93e810a2edaafc326edee51071da9d398e83"},"solana":{"decimal_place":2,"contract_address":"ErSZNwsamWjR9Hj2o18GLwVyTkooyGbdptjMjuv72X8A"},"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xf2b2f7b47715256ce4ea43363a867fdce9353e3a"}}}
