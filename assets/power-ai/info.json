{"name":"Power AI","id":"power-ai","symbol":"powerai","description":"Power AI establishes a decentralized computing network by connecting idle GPUs from contributors around the world. This network provides a scalable and flexible solution for AI training and inference tasks. By utilizing these underused resources, Power AI maximizes efficiency and reduces the reliance on centralized data centers, thus lowering costs and environmental impact. PowerAI enables individuals and small businesses to access computing resources at a low cost, while owners of idle resources can earn rewards by renting out their computational power. At the same time, PowerAI provides AI services to small and medium-sized enterprises, helping them compete with larger tech companies","links":"https://power-ai.me/","market_cap":61874,"market_cap_rank":5148,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/power-ai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x3a781d792ca81b52363f91b1f251f94a8eba4b4b"}}}
