{"name":"Icarus Network","id":"icarus-network","symbol":"ica","description":"ICARUS NETWORK is the first fully data-driven shared ledger protocol to manage governance on-chain and off-chain data. Icarus has no transaction fees, unlimited storage of data (and types) and is backward compatible with Ethereum. ICARUS NETWORK PROTOCOL presents a novel method called Delegated Asynchronous Proof of Stake (DAPos), which is designed as an algorithm via parallelism to maximize transaction throughput by representatives. ICARUS NETWORK uses this algorithm to replace traditional data archiving methods such as the cloud, to present infinite possibilities for utilization, and provide scalable solutions for developing and managing data-driven distributed dApps. ICARUS NETWORK can be used in various fields such as P2P content market, electronic medical records (EMR) system, token sale, etc.","links":"https://icarusnetwork.org/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/icarus-network/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd2f29748f8698606dca9f48b8967241b595ab9e5"}}}
