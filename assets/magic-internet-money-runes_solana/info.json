{"name":"MAGIC•INTERNET•MONEY (Bitcoin)","id":"magic-internet-money-runes_solana","symbol":"mim","description":"Magic Internet Money (MIM) is the first mainstream Bitcoin meme, originally created in 2013 and deployed a decade later on the Bitcoin blockchain by its original artist, Mavensbot. It all began in the r/bitcoin subreddit, where Mavensbot posted his now-iconic MS Paint artwork of the “Magic Internet Money Wizard”. His drawing was later turned into a reddit ad to promote Bitcoin. It then became the most successful Reddit ad of all time and played a key role in Bitcoin’s early rise from $27 to $1,132, while helping grow the r/bitcoin subreddit community from 10,000 to over 100,000 subscribers by the end of 2014.","links":"https://magicinternetmoney.party/","market_cap":7688645,"market_cap_rank":1759,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/magic-internet-money-runes/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":2,"contract_address":"M1M6sdffCs3ozzhpRveweRCWdZhxth4mvVujPtYEC3h","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/M1M6sdffCs3ozzhpRveweRCWdZhxth4mvVujPtYEC3h"}},"is_native":false}
