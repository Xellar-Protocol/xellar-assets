{"name":"DarkMatter","id":"darkmatter","symbol":"dmt","description":"OogaVerse is a collection of 2,000 randomly generated NFTs that live on the Ethereum Blockchain. The first 100 Oogas were stealth listed on OpenSea on the 7th of September. Their 1,900 remaining brethren joined their mission one month later, with only one thing in mind - going to the moon. Oogas are the hardest working Apes in the universe. After the migration to our official contract, each Genesis Ooga will passively yield 20 $DMT a day. The DarkMatter Token $DMT will serve as a token that can be spent on the following utilities: Ooga customization, breeding Baby Oogas, and as the sole accepted Token for the purchase of the coveted MoonPass. The $DMT Token has no financial value and only serves the utility of the OogaVerse.","links":"https://mekaapes.game/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/darkmatter/logo.png"}
