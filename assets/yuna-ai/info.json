{"name":"Yuna AI","id":"yuna-ai","symbol":"yuna","description":"Yuna is an AI trend-fund manager that automatically monitors X (Twitter) for emerging trends and launches tokens based on them. Using advanced data analysis algorithms, Yuna creates investment proposals that go through 30-minute community voting. After approval, Yuna automatically creates and launches tokens on PumpFun, securing first position and maximizing profits. All profits are distributed between $YUNA token buybacks and fund growth for future deals. During the beta phase, voting is open to everyone, but this feature will become exclusive to $YUNA holders in the future. Join the first fully automated AI trend-fund where artificial intelligence and community wisdom create unique investment opportunities.","links":"https://yuna.vc/","market_cap":11506.67,"market_cap_rank":10713,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/yuna-ai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"QYnF7d11R8WY4A9v8djqzXrAAnAJtf3wB5bF8T38PBu","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/QYnF7d11R8WY4A9v8djqzXrAAnAJtf3wB5bF8T38PBu"}}}
