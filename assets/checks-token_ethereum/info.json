Launched 12 days ago, we gathered a small community of like-minded people. In the past 3 days, we have had significant interest from the crypto community which took us to over 5M market cap and now we have settled around the 1.2M mark. What’s next for your project? We are continuously working to provide better value to our members. We want to improve our DAO governance and work our way towards total decentralisation. We will run campaigns and events to support meme creators and artists. What can your token be used for? DAO voting.","links":"https://checkstoken.co","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/checks-token_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x049e9f5369358786a1ce6483d668d062cfe547ec","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x049e9f5369358786a1ce6483d668d062cfe547ec"}},"is_native":false}
