{"name":"Mercury Protocol 404","id":"mercury-protocol-404","symbol":"m404","description":"MERCURY is the next-gen Layer-2 on ERC! The purpose of Mercury 404 is to redefine the future of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, especially regarding scalability. The project aims to overcome fundamental challenges faced by blockchain, such as processing capacity limitations and transaction confirmation times, through the implementation of layer-2 solutions on the ERC network. By doing so, Mercury 404 seeks to provide a faster, more efficient, and accessible transaction experience, thereby driving widespread adoption and continuous innovation within the blockchain ecosystem. Native EVM Integration. Proof-of-Work Mechanism. Decentralized Governance. True Finality in the Algorithm Through these functions, we aim to elevate the level of the ERC network, mitigating fees and transaction times, bringing more scalability to all.","links":"https://mercury404.app/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mercury-protocol-404/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xbebed917919823e7493a902269b499860da5235c"}}}
