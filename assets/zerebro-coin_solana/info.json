{"name":"Zerebro Coin","id":"zerebro-coin_solana","symbol":"zcoin","description":"The $zCoin Launchpad emerges as a direct response to the pervasive issues plaguing traditional token launch platforms on the Solana blockchain, including opaque presales, insider allocations, rug-pull vulnerabilities, and insufficient liquidity mechanisms. By harnessing the innovative Dynamic Bonding Curve (DBC) protocol from Meteora, $zCoin redefines token launches as fair, transparent, and high-velocity events. This platform not only eliminates common risks but also establishes a self-sustaining ecosystem where trading fees are recycled to reward creators, liquidity providers, traders, and long-term holders alike. At its core, $zCoin is more than a launchpad—it's a decentralized economic engine that democratizes access to early-stage projects while ensuring that every participant benefits from network growth. With Solana's unparalleled speed (up to 65,000 TPS) and low fees (~$0.00025 per transaction), $zCoin positions itself to capture the explosive demand for meme coins, DeFi primitives, and utility tokens in a market projected to exceed $10 trillion in total value locked by 2030.","links":"https://zcoinpad.fun/","market_cap":4608.13,"market_cap_rank":12474,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/zerebro-coin_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"G1r487Exo1Z5pLmkqLbdhT7s18WoRr6pDpdD3uSqpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/G1r487Exo1Z5pLmkqLbdhT7s18WoRr6pDpdD3uSqpump"}},"is_native":false}
