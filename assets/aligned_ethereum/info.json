{"name":"Aligned","id":"aligned_ethereum","symbol":"align","description":"Aligned is a ZK verification layer, a decentralized network that verifies zero knowledge proofs on Ethereum via Eigenlayer AVS with a 90% cost reduction and will create a new era of developers having access to developing and operating applications that require ZK proof verification, easier, faster and cheaper. Current on-chain verification costs in Ethereum reach hundreds of millions of dollars per year. Verifying a STARK proof on Ethereum itself costs 1,000,000 gas. Aligned allows developers to verify and use the result of their proofs at least 90% cheaper for all proof systems. Aligned believes that these costs can be driven even further down. The current Mainnet Beta can handle 1000 proofs per second while keeping low costs per proof. Aligned is a high throughput, cost affordable zk verification layer that is highly versatile for a technology that is rapidly evolving. Zero-Knowledge technology is constantly changing with major breakthroughs, Aligned is designed to easily adapt to any new technologies that exist today or in the future.","links":"https://alignedlayer.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/aligned/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x50614cc8e44f7814549c223aa31db9296e58057c","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x50614cc8e44f7814549c223aa31db9296e58057c"}},"is_native":false}
