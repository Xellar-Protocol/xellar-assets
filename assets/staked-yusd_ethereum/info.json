{"name":"Staked YUSD","id":"staked-yusd_ethereum","symbol":"syusd","description":"Overview sYUSD is the yield-bearing, staked version of YUSD. When you deposit YUSD into the staking contract you receive sYUSD, which: Represents your proportional share of the staking pool. Automatically accrues BTC funding-rate yield. Appreciates in value relative to YUSD over time. Launch exchange rate: 1 sYUSD = 1 YUSD Afterwards: 1 sYUSD > 1 YUSD as rewards accumulate. The StakedYUSD smart contract implements the ERC4626 Token Vault standard for composability. This popular standard is widely used for onchain reward-accruing; thus, it is expected that other user interfaces beyond the Aegis.im dAPP may likely support YUSD staking in the future. Various deposit and redeem functions are exposed, enabling staking with or without a slippage threshold, and with or without an ERC2612 Permit signature authorizing the transfer of YUSD.","links":"https://aegis.im/","market_cap":16719533,"market_cap_rank":1218,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/staked-yusd_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xfe0ccc9942e98c963fe6b4e5194eb6e3baa4cb64","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xfe0ccc9942e98c963fe6b4e5194eb6e3baa4cb64"}},"is_native":false}
