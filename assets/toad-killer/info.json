The goal of $TOAD is to demonstrate to the world that there is only one original project, and as their slogan says: \"We already killed a dog\" - so frogs and new memecoins are about to end when the king reappears. There's many hints on their launch and website that hint everyone who may be back of this mysterious project, specially when talking about killing dogs.
