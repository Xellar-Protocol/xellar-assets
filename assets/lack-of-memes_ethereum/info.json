{"name":"Lack Of Memes","id":"lack-of-memes_ethereum","symbol":"memeless","description":"$MEMELESS (Lack Of Memes) is a community-driven token launched on Ethereum, inspired by a meme video shared by Elon Musk that humorously warned, “you have died from lack of memes.” The project embraces this narrative by positioning itself as the antidote to the current lull in meme culture. $MEMELESS aims to spark creativity, fun, and a sense of belonging in the crypto space, reminding everyone that memes are not just entertainment—they’re a cultural force that drives communities. The project welcomes newcomers from Elon’s post, crypto media, and across social platforms to join in building a movement that thrives on humor and connection.","links":"https://lackofmemes.com/","market_cap":10195.93,"market_cap_rank":11129,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/lack-of-memes/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xacc5f95ead9874c21b6e83f4c051045a133e1b94","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xacc5f95ead9874c21b6e83f4c051045a133e1b94"}},"is_native":false}
