{"name":"IceCream AI","id":"icecream-ai","symbol":"icecream","description":"IceCream AI is KOL4U's flagship DeFAI protocol, introducing novel AI-governed smart contracts known as Glaze Pools. Glaze Pools evaluate the impact of any given Community Member on community engagement based on their activity on X, and then distribute On-Chain Assets accordingly. By seeding Glaze Pools, Projects can finally offer performance-based incentives at scale to all members of their community --- anyone who drives community engagement can now monetize their AI-evaluated impact, regardless of their follower count on X. IceCream AI is currently live on BNB Chain and Ronin Network, and the ICECREAM token exists only on the BNB Chain.","links":"https://www.kol4u.xyz","market_cap":17446296,"market_cap_rank":1204,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/icecream-ai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd438b82543fb109f34575c825edaeefc98f1f2b4"}}}
