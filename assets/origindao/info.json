{"name":"OriginDAO","id":"origindao","symbol":"og","description":"Ever since the dawn of time, humanity has asked what is the purpose of life? In a world tainted by the corporate elites, it became commonplace for the masses to get lost in the haze of manipulation and mass marketing. As humanity progressed through the ages, greed set in. Focusing on more rather than less with no reminder that quantity does not always equate to quality. As a result we grow more distant as individuals being left with a feeling of emptiness. There is simple pleasure in execution of a basic task well done. We are all part of one another, you are not a singular being floating through time and space. Often our collective power is unrecognised and overlooked. You are not alone, we are one. It is time to reunite. To go back to our ORIGIN.","links":"https://www.origindao.app/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/origindao/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x11a0762da58a487c075249b9b9edf9f7eb1bc9f5"}}}
