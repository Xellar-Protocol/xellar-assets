{"name":"MULTIVERSE MONKEY","id":"multiverse-monkey_ethereum","symbol":"mmon","description":"MMON is a utility token built on the Ethereum blockchain that integrates GameFi, MemeFi, and DeFi elements into a unified Web3 ecosystem. The token allows users to participate in various on-chain activities such as gaming, NFT-based content, and staking systems, with utility embedded across multiple platforms. MMON serves as the core currency in a slot casino, poker tournaments, and meme-based interactive campaigns. Unlike typical meme tokens, MMON is designed with real use cases in mind. After listing on centralized exchanges, the token follows a deflationary model, with scheduled burn events to manage supply and support long-term price stability. This structure positions MMON as both a cultural asset and a functional utility within the crypto ecosystem.","links":"http://MMON.AI","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/multiverse-monkey_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x5bc93bab1291885a76644a49f52050cf73e1dca8","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x5bc93bab1291885a76644a49f52050cf73e1dca8"}},"is_native":false}
