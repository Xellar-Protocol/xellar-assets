{"name":"Nest BTC Vault","id":"nest-btc-vault","symbol":"nbtc","description":"Nest's mission is to build a global, permissionless, onchain economy where anyone can earn from real world yields. Nest is the flagship staking protocol of the Plume RWAfi ecosystem, with a permissionless product that enables anyone to earn institutional-grade APYs from real world assets. Through Nest, fund managers and asset issuers can create new financial instruments by curating vaults. Each vault contains various streams of yield derived from onchain and offchain real world assets. Users can enter and exit each vault, managing and trading their ERC-20 vault tokens permissionlessly, and independently of the underlying streams of yield. nBTC is a risk-free yield strategy built specifically for BTC holders. By using delta-neutral futures positions on regulated markets like CME, it captures premium without exposing users to Bitcoin price swings. It’s a way to earn stable, institutional-grade yield while keeping your BTC working. Returns on this vault are paid in Bitcoin.","links":"https://app.nest.credit/nest-btc-vault","market_cap":0.00005291,"market_cap_rank":10462,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nest-btc-vault/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"0x02cdb5ccc97d5dc7ed2747831b516669eb635706"},"plume-network":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"0x02cdb5ccc97d5dc7ed2747831b516669eb635706","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/plume-network/tokens/0x02cdb5ccc97d5dc7ed2747831b516669eb635706"}}}
