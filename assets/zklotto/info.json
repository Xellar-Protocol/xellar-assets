{"name":"zkLotto","id":"zklotto","symbol":"zklotto","description":"zkLotto is a fun and simple lottery contract on zkSync. We took inspiration from the existing Arbitrum Lotto project and extended it with automatic payouts handled by the zkLotto smart contract. zkLotto can be traded exclusively on zkSync's Mute exchange. Every zkLotto purchase participates in the jackpot lottery. The jackpot grows automatically in value by collecting taxes from buys/sells. Chances to win depend on the purchased amount. Currently, approx. every $100 in zkLotto increases your probability of winning by 1%. zkLotto is the first automated lottery on zkSync. Every buy/sell contributes to a jackpot - every $100 zkLotto purchase has a 1% chance to win. The zkLotto smart contract handles all jackpot payouts in a fair and transparent way. The winning buy receives the payout instantly within the same tx. There are no VCs or early investors. Liquidity is locked & provided by multiple parties & the contract was renounced.","links":"https://zklotto.io","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/zklotto/logo.png","detail_platform":{"zksync":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0x94466dcfe241db963af1bc9741a94daa87ab2169"}}}
