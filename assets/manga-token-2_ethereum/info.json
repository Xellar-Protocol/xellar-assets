{"name":"HONO Protocol","id":"manga-token-2_ethereum","symbol":"hono","description":"HONO Protocol is building the foundation for growth-backed liquidity in DeFi. Every HONO token is fully collateralized by yield-bearing staked ETH (wstETH) and designed to steadily appreciate in value while maintaining stability. Instead of being a static store of value like traditional stablecoins, HONO turns liquidity into an active, compounding asset that grows through staking yield, trading fees, and protocol income. It enables a sustainable liquidity layer where value creation is continuous, transparent, and tied directly to real on-chain activity.","links":"https://honoprotocol.com","market_cap":100913,"market_cap_rank":6990,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/manga-token-2_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0e16bd2cd962fadb4a23ec961bb170ffa25208a8","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x0e16bd2cd962fadb4a23ec961bb170ffa25208a8"}},"is_native":false}
