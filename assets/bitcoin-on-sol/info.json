{"name":"Bitcoin on SOL","id":"bitcoin-on-sol","symbol":"btc","description":"A project that aims to relive the early days of Bitcoin while teaching the community about Proof-of-Work and other Cryptocurrency basics One of the key innovations of our project is the integration of Solana's blockchain technology, particularly the use of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as a core component of the mining process. Solana's blockchain is known for its high throughput and low transaction fees, making it an ideal platform for handling a large number of transactions efficiently. By utilizing Solana NFTs, we are not only leveraging the efficiency and scalability of the Solana network but also adding a unique twist to the concept of mining. In this revised system, mining is no longer an activity that requires massive computational power and energy consumption. Instead, it is tied to unique digital assets - Solana NFTs - each contributing a fixed amount of hash power to the network. This approach democratizes the mining process, as it allows individuals to participate in mining by owning these NFTs. Additionally, this system caps the total number of miners to 10,000 - as represented by the limited number of NFTs. This cap ensures that the network remains decentralized and that no single entity can gain undue control over the Bitcoin network.","links":"https://sol-btc.xyz/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bitcoin-on-sol/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"BTCBZ6hrcn5g8MANyQep6QVqZWpD5TqjSUKTUKHivkfa"}}}
