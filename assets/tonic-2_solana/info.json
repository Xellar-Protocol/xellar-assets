{"name":"TONIC","id":"tonic-2_solana","symbol":"$tonic","description":"Tonic is a community takeover project inspired by the real life dog that helped shape the Bonk mascot. It is supported by Branche and several Bonk contributors which plays a key role in its narrative. Tonic is about pure community power memes and good energy. We support Bonk and related projects create content and grow together with the community through vibes creativity and collaboration. Tonic is not a traditional project with a fixed roadmap or leadership. It is decentralized meaning no single person or team owns or controls it. Everything is driven by the community","links":"https://www.tonicinu.fun/","market_cap":48970,"market_cap_rank":8238,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/tonic-2_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"2DSFvQtdoqv7DjPgXL5tjTYJ3ABBnoBeTfAJTXNdbonk","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/2DSFvQtdoqv7DjPgXL5tjTYJ3ABBnoBeTfAJTXNdbonk"}},"is_native":false}
