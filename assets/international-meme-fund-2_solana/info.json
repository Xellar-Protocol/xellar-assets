{"name":"International Meme Fund","id":"international-meme-fund-2_solana","symbol":"imf","description":"The International Meme Fund (IMF) is a memecoin and charity coin that aids traders using trading fees. The IMF is dedicated to maintaining stability in the global meme economy through strategic interventions, emergency support, and comprehensive market analysis. Our mission is to aid user losses, prevent meme market collapses and ensure sustainable growth in digital culture assets. Using fees accumulated via the PumpSwap platform, the IMF can distribute so-called \"bailouts\" to people affected by market downturns and spread the revenue among holders that were selected. The IMF might also intervene in major catastrophes occurring in the crypto scene and send donations to those affected.","links":"https://www.internationalmemefund.fun/","market_cap":11988.02,"market_cap_rank":10796,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/international-meme-fund-2_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"DwmsWi1yWRiqXnbD6JJfGMQawfcqqBnRSyk6QEoGpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/DwmsWi1yWRiqXnbD6JJfGMQawfcqqBnRSyk6QEoGpump"}},"is_native":false}
