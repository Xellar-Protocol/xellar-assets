{"name":"TaleX","id":"talex_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"x","description":"The native cryptographically-secure fungible protocol token of TaleX (ticker symbol $X) is a transferable representation of attributed utility functions specified in the protocol of TaleX, and which is designed to be used solely as an interoperable utility token thereon. $X is a functional multi-utility token which will be used as a unit of account and economic incentive which will be distributed to encourage users to exert efforts towards contribution and participation in the ecosystem on TaleX, thereby creating a mutually beneficial system where every participant is fairly compensated for its efforts. $X is an integral and indispensable part of TaleX, because without $X, there would be no incentive for users to expend resources to participate in activities or provide services for the benefit of the ecosystem. Given that additional $X will be awarded to a user based only on its actual usage, activity and efforts made on TaleX and/or proportionate to the frequency and volume of transactions, users of TaleX and/or holders of $X which did not actively participate will not receive any $X incentives.","links":"https://app.talex.world/","market_cap":2576743,"market_cap_rank":2706,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/talex_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0510101ec6c49d24ed911f0011e22a0d697ee776","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x0510101ec6c49d24ed911f0011e22a0d697ee776"}},"is_native":false}
