Including trending services. We will have a special weekly spotlight to showcase new games. A user-voted “pick of the week” will be chosen as well. We want to promote the tokens & games that a community is behind. This isn’t a “promote anyone who sends in a payment” type of platform. Quality over quantity is important to us.
