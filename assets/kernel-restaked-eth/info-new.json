{"name":"Kernel Restaked ETH","id":"kernel-restaked-eth","symbol":"kreth","description":"krETH is mintable against any LRT that is restakable on Karak. Users can deposit their LRTs onto Kernel Protocol, where they will be restaked on Karak and then the user will be given an equivalent quantity of krETH tokens, representing their Karak-restaked holdings. Mint krETH using any approved LRT as collateral. Simply connect your wallet, select the asset you wish to mint with, input the amount and press “Mint”. In return you’ll receive an equivalent quantity of krETH to deploy in further yield-bearing DeFi activities. Whilst your assets are restaked you’ll be earning Kernel Points and Karak XP in the background.","links":"https://kernelprotocol.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kernel-restaked-eth/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf02c96dbbb92dc0325ad52b3f9f2b951f972bf00"}}}
