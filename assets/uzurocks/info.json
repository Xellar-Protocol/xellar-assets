{"name":"UZUROCKS","id":"uzurocks","symbol":"uzrs","description":"A virtuous cycle of linking between various celebrity content and blockchain systems for everyone. Currently, creators are restricted by large centralized tech companies and capital assets. With Web 3.0, we are enabling any content creator to connect to the decentralized platform in order to stream. Uzurocks NFT offers the world of NFTs a means of surpassing the limited goal of just trading digital works or works of art. It enables an NFT related to copyright or membership-type real assets to serve as a store of value as well as a source of profits. For instance, providing some part of the copyright to NFT owners as a reward, or giving the priority of watching the content to those who hold certain NFTs. Unlike other NFT providers, we are building services that offer real benefits by operating our own NFT marketplace for NFT sales and an N-Fi(NFT+De-Fi) service. In addition, we are developing various Web 3.0 services such as W2E and C2E, providing celebrities with a foothold into new businesses and sources of fame by connecting them to the world. We expect this project to allow the users to not only watch content of Uzurocks, but also interact with it and therefore better enjoy it.","links":"http://www.uzurocks.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/uzurocks/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
