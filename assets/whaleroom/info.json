{"name":"WhaleRoom","id":"whaleroom","symbol":"whl","description":"WHL is the native social token and community management mechanism chosen for the whaleroom.org social infrastructure platform. The social tokens can be used to gain access to the official WhaleRoom rooms, special crypto-focused features, and to unlock extra room hosting discounts on host.whaleroom.org. The WhaleRoom platform has been built from the ground up to make it easy for token/coin/NFT creators, brands, and organizations to deploy a token-gated social space for their holders without a tech team. WhaleRoom's \"proof of ownership\" technology is patent pending in the USA and allows the platform to support tokens on any blockchain and for Room Hosts to configure their own room entry criteria in minutes, not months.","links":"https://whaleroom.org/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/whaleroom/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x2af72850c504ddd3c1876c66a914caee7ff8a46a"}}}
