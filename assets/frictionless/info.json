{"name":"Frictionless","id":"frictionless","symbol":"fric","description":"Frictionless stands out as a groundbreaking decentralized P2P exchange, empowering users with a seamless and secure trading experience on the Ethereum blockchain. The platform introduces a non-custodial environment, eradicating counterparty risk, and a decentralized P2P model that grants users absolute control over their assets. What sets Frictionless apart is its commitment to facilitating transactions with no price impact, a distinct advantage over both centralized and decentralized exchanges. Addressing challenges such as high-volume token sales and mitigating market impact, Frictionless aids token projects by enabling efficient allocation of vesting schedules for institutional investors. Token projects, often high-volume token holders themselves, face the challenge of selling their treasuries on the market to secure budgets, potentially harming their own token prices. Frictionless' decentralized P2P exchange model offers a strategic advantage by allowing projects to trade native tokens without negatively affecting market prices, ensuring a more sustainable approach to fundraising and development.","links":"https://frictionless.network/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/frictionless/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x23fa3aa82858e7ad1f0f04352f4bb7f5e1bbfb68","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x23fa3aa82858e7ad1f0f04352f4bb7f5e1bbfb68"}}}
