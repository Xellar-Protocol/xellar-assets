{"name":"TaoBank","id":"taobank","symbol":"tbank","description":"TaoBank is an innovative lending protocol designed for TAO. One critical issue TAO holders face is the inability to leverage their digital assets for liquidity without having to sell them. TaoBank solves this problem by allowing TAO holders to use their assets as collateral for loans. This system offers a dual benefit: it provides immediate liquidity to the asset holders while allowing them to retain ownership of their TAO.","links":"https://www.taobank.ai/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/taobank/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x95ccffae3eb8767d4a941ec43280961dde89f4de"}}}
