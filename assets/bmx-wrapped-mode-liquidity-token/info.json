{"name":"BMX: Wrapped Mode Liquidity Token","id":"bmx-wrapped-mode-liquidity-token","symbol":"wmlt","description":"BMX has deployed on Mode, an exciting and rapidly growing L2 network built on Optimism Superchain. All mechanics are mostly the same as BMX on Base, with the liquidity token MLT composed of bluechips and USDC. Similar to BLT on our deployment on Base, MLT earns fees from all trading activity on BMX on Mode. The wrapped liquidity token, wMLT, has all the benefits expected from the Yearn-architectured wrapped liquidity vault token, wBLT. These include automatically compounding rewards, possible advantageous liquidity with other tokens in DEX pairs, and enhanced borrowing power due to the automatically compounding rewards, increasing its value over time, essentially self-repaying debt.","links":"https://bmx.trade/","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bmx-wrapped-mode-liquidity-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"mode":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8b2eea0999876aab1e7955fe01a5d261b570452c"}}}
