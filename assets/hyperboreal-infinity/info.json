By training LLMs on vast datasets of protein structures, functions, and interactions, we could uncover novel proteins with the potential to slow aging, repair cells, or enhance resilience to age-related diseases. This approach leverages cutting-edge AI to revolutionize how we understand and engineer proteins for extending human healthspan.","links":"https://x.com/HYPRINF","market_cap":347317,"market_cap_rank":4898,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/hyperboreal-infinity/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"FEiphCSAqjAxvtyMxj8boFTABrZBFyngfyrZueqeMw3q"}}}
