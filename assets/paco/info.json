{"name":"Paco","id":"paco","symbol":"$paco","description":"Paco's coin is 100% penguin-made, with no humans involvedâ€”seriously, none. This entire project was conceived in Paco's basement, purely for his own amusement and dreams of world domination. There's no team, no backup, and definitely no accountability. The coin serves no real purpose other than to keep Paco entertained and maybe, just maybe, buy him a golden fish someday. Any updates? Well, they're at the mercy of random internet folks and whatever whim Paco's feeling that day.","links":"https://paco.army/","market_cap":53965,"market_cap_rank":5233,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/paco/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"AbK6sxHUV26mqQFTw8HgckKApHyev1ESZsKiRTJcFESB"}}}
