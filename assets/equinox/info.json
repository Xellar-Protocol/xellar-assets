{"name":"Equinox","id":"equinox","symbol":"enx","description":"The Equinox will be a play-to-earn mobile game, available on both IOS and Android, developed by South Game Studio. The tower rush type of game puts players in an arena ( 1v1 ) where the objective is to destroy the opposing towers, with the destruction of the “main tower”, it will be an instantaneous win. $EQUINOX tokens will allow holders to propose and vote during DAO governance meetings to determine new features, upgrades, and/or parameters to the ecosystem or provide feedback. $EQUINOX is linked to the Solminator NFT project that sold out in 27mintues. Before the game release token will be used for Staking features: The network aims to reward active NFT holders. Hence, users that stake their NFTs or provide liquidity on other decentralized platforms in exchange for LP tokens (Liquidity Pool), will receive rewards in the form of $EQUINOX. Each Solminator NFT will be born with Level 1. However, Solminators want to evolve and transform into the superior levels; therefore they visit incubators. Level 1 & 2 Solminators can be sent into an incubator to get the superior roles. For the beginning, this will be used for incubators. In our innovative NFT evolution process, NFT holders can send their Solminator into an incubator and by burning $EQUINOX tokens you can evolve into a superior level.","links":"https://www.solminator.com","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/equinox/logo.png"}
