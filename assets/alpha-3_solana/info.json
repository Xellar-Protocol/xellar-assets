{"name":"Reject Modernity","id":"alpha-3_solana","symbol":"alpha","description":"Rejecting modernity while embracing tradition and masculinity can be seen as a call to return to foundational values that emphasize strength, resilience, and a sense of purpose. In a rapidly changing world often characterized by uncertainty and superficiality, this perspective champions the importance of time-honored principles that have shaped communities and identities for generations. It advocates for a lifestyle that honors familial bonds, ethical conduct, and the cultivation of personal virtues, encouraging men to take on roles of responsibility and leadership.
