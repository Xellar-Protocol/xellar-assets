{"name":"Enkrion","id":"enkrion_solana","symbol":"enkrion","description":"SONIC protocol implements optimized zero-knowledge proof systems for privacy-preserving cryptocurrency transfers. Using lightweight cryptographic commitments and efficient proof generation, SONIC enables encrypted transaction execution with minimal computational overhead while maintaining foundational privacy guarantees. All transactions are encrypted end-to-end using zero-knowledge proof systems. Transaction details remain hidden during execution: // ZK proof generation for encrypted transfer function generateTransferProof(amount, sender, receiver): // Create cryptographic commitment commitment = hash(amount, sender, receiver, nonce) // Generate zero-knowledge proof proof = { publicInputs: [commitment], privateInputs: [amount, sender, receiver, nonce] } // Prove validity without revealing details zkProof = proveStatement( \"I know values that hash to commitment\", proof.publicInputs, proof.privateInputs ) return {commitment, zkProof} Validators can verify transaction validity without learning sender, receiver, or amount.","links":"https://enkrion.com/","market_cap":4690.06,"market_cap_rank":12451,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/enkrion/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"CuFFw6irQnSV48HwdM4mKGauSwEWqTEztL14kShLpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/CuFFw6irQnSV48HwdM4mKGauSwEWqTEztL14kShLpump"}},"is_native":false}
