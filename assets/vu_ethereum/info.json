{"name":"Vu","id":"vu_ethereum","symbol":"vu","description":"Vu is a decentralized infrastructure for censorship-resistant journalism and truth discovery. It allows anonymous users to submit news and media, which is validated by a community-governed DAO using on-chain voting and zk-proofs. Once approved, stories are distributed across decentralized and centralized channels like X, Telegram, and IPFS. Vu aims to restore access to unfiltered, verifiable information without relying on centralized gatekeepers.","links":"https://readvu.com/","market_cap":142708,"market_cap_rank":6447,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/vu/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6f99ad269c84e0e80318f6cfb01323c7bda4b087","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x6f99ad269c84e0e80318f6cfb01323c7bda4b087"}},"is_native":false}
