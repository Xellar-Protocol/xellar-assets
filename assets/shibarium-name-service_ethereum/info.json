It is a philanthropic attempt at creating something special and necessary for the next generation of builders and crypto enthusiasts. Shibarium Name Service allows you to mint or buy .inu domain Every .inu domain represents your wallet so you can receive crypto, NFTs and just about anything else in the Shibarium Metaverse Shibarium Name Service Identity matters in web3, we can all agree on that — ENS domains have showed us that people care about the convenience and prestige of owning rare id’s.
