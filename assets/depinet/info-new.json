At its core, DEPINET aims to reshape the way people interact with the internet by prioritizing individual sovereignty over data and identity. By offering a suite of products—including a decentralized VPN (dVPN), a privacy-focused browser (dBrowser), private file storage, a secure wallet, and a scalable blockchain—DEPINET delivers a holistic, user-centric environment. This ecosystem eliminates reliance on centralized control, putting you, the user, back in charge of your data, your browsing experience, and your digital assets.","links":"https://depinet.app/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/depinet/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x28e58ee9932697f610de907a279684d30c407ba9"}}}
