{"name":"No One","id":"no-one","symbol":"noone","description":"No one project started as a social experiment. Launch without a community, website, or any other social media. The goal of the launch was to see if random strangers can establish the community without resources. Several individuals recognized the project, and theyâ€™ve built the community around it. One of the main goals of the project is to entertain the community with high reward riddles that require skills in steganography, cryptography, and watermarking. NOONE also issued the first NFT collection, which is an introduction to GameFi.","links":"https://no-one.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/no-one/logo.png"}
