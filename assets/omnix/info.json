{"name":"OMNIX","id":"omnix","symbol":"omnix","description":"OmniX is an interop infrastructure and dApps suite built to enable seamless, composable onchain experiences. Originally launched as the first ONFT launchpad on LayerZero, it has evolved into a protocol stack powering cross-chain applications and infrastructure. Current products include OmniX Send (gasless top-ups across 40+ EVM chains), OmniX DVN (a LayerZero v2 decentralized verifier), and Oxi Trade (a native Hyperliquid trading experience currently in development), with more onchain experiences coming soon—including VRF-powered ONFTs. OmniX now builds natively on Hyperliquid.","links":"https://omni-x.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/omnix/logo.png","detail_platform":{"hyperliquid":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0x216a1428334ac9e908e76a02a1812416"},"hyperevm":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x45ec8f63fe934c0213476cfb5870835e61dd11fa","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/hyperevm/tokens/0x45ec8f63fe934c0213476cfb5870835e61dd11fa"}}}
