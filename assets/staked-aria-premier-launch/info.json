{"name":"Staked Aria Premier Launch","id":"staked-aria-premier-launch","symbol":"stapl","description":"Founded in 2025, Aria is the first protocol to bring iconic real-world IP—starting with music—onchain as liquid revenue-generating tokens. Built on Story Protocol, Aria transforms cultural assets into programmable IP Real-World Assets (IPRWAs). Retail investors access income-producing IP through Aria, while institutions scale tokenized portfolios via Aria PRIME. Early offerings include partial rights to works by Justin Bieber,Miley Cyrus, and BLACKPINK. Aria enables investors to co-own IP and earn real-world revenue from streaming and licensing, while creators tokenize and manage their IP with permissioned onchain tools for automated attribution, licensing, and royalty payouts. Looking ahead, Aria will power a permissioned remix economy, where smart contracts govern how IP is licensed, monetized, and remixed—laying the financial rails for the next era of the IP economy.","links":"https://ariaprotocol.xyz/","market_cap":7425659,"market_cap_rank":2032,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/staked-aria-premier-launch/logo.png","detail_platform":{"story":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb5461c1fd0312cd4bf037058f8a391e6a42f9639","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/story/tokens/0xb5461c1fd0312cd4bf037058f8a391e6a42f9639"}}}
