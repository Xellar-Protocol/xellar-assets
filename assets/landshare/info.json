{"name":"Landshare","id":"landshare","symbol":"land","description":"Landshare is a DeFi platform on the Binance Smart Chain offering a hassle-free alternative to traditional real estate investments. Featuring asset-based stablecoin vaults, a utility token, house flipping pools and a governance protocol, Landshare offers a full fledged DeFi platform based on US real estate assets. Simply stake your stablecoins in our Property Vault to earn yields based on the rental value and appreciation of assets, or invest in our house flipping pools to earn a lump sum payout. The utility token of the platform is the Landshare Token. The token is earned as a reward for staking in the Property Vault and is required to access all platform features. The token features several price-stability elements, such as limited minting, buybacks, presale vesting, token burns, and supply cap. Additional utilities of the token include governance voting, staking, and charitable fundraising. The flagship feature of the Landshare platform is the Property Vault. The Property Vault is a BUSD-based vault whose capacity is tied to the market value of Landshareâ€™s referenced real estate assets. Investing in the vault entitles investors to stablecoin yields based on regional rental rates and property value appreciation of the referenced assets. In addition to stablecoin payouts, stakers also receive Landshare tokens and a bonus generated from yield farms for a combined average APR of 20-40%.","links":"https://landshare.io/","market_cap":7813621,"market_cap_rank":2064,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/landshare/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa73164db271931cf952cbaeff9e8f5817b42fa5c"},"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x27bc2757fab0b8ab406016d1f71d8123452095d3"},"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc03e6ad83de7c58c9166ff08d66b960d78e64105"}}}
