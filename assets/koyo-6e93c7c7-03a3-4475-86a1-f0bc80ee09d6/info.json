{"name":"Koyo","id":"koyo-6e93c7c7-03a3-4475-86a1-f0bc80ee09d6","symbol":"koy","description":"Koyo Token is a decentralized finance (DeFi) project built on the Ethereum blockchain. The project's goal is to provide a platform where users can access various financial services, including lending, borrowing, and staking, in a secure and decentralized manner. The Koyo Token is the native cryptocurrency of the platform, and it serves as a means of payment for accessing the different financial services on the platform. The token is ERC-20 compliant, meaning that it can be stored in any ERC-20 compatible wallet and traded on any ERC-20 compatible exchange. One of the unique features of Koyo Token is its decentralized governance model. The project is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that is composed of Koyo Token holders. The DAO allows token holders to participate in the decision-making process of the project, such as voting on proposals for platform upgrades, changes to the tokenomics, and more. The Koyo Token platform also provides users with the opportunity to earn rewards through staking. Staking involves holding a certain amount of Koyo Tokens in a wallet for a specified period, in exchange for earning rewards in the form of more Koyo Tokens. Overall, Koyo Token aims to provide a secure and transparent financial ecosystem that empowers users to take control of their finances and participate in the governance of the platform.","links":"https://koyotoken.com/","market_cap":424880,"market_cap_rank":3361,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/koyo-6e93c7c7-03a3-4475-86a1-f0bc80ee09d6/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x198065e69a86cb8a9154b333aad8efe7a3c256f8"}}}
