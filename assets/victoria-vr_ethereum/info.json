{"name":"Victoria VR","id":"victoria-vr_ethereum","symbol":"vr","description":"Victoria VR: Open-Source AI Platform for the 3D Internet Victoria VR is an open-source AI platform that transforms natural language prompts into 3D content and next-generation applications. It provides a full-stack environment for creating, publishing, and operating immersive spatial experiences across desktop, VR, and mobile — forming a foundation layer of Operating Reality and the Immersive Internet. Key Sectors and Applications • AI Platform & Infrastructure: Prompt-to-3D platform with hybrid cloud + decentralized contributors • Generative AI: Spatial models convert text to assets, worlds, and logic. • AI Robotics & Agentic AI: Autonomous, tool-using agents with planning and memory that execute multi-step tasks • AI-Powered Avatars: Voice-ready, self-sufficient NPCs/assistants across devices as fully rigged 3D characters with true spatial movement (navigation, gestures, lip-sync). • Spatial Computing: Production runtime for physics, networking, identity, deployment, and analytics across VR, mobile, and desktop. • Enterprise Applications: No-code twins, configurators, virtual stores and showrooms. • Education & Training: No-code modules for simulations, learning, and workforce training. • Gaming: Games and experiences building, AI avatars and cross-platform publishing. • AI Infrastructure: Orchestration of multi-model AI for text, image, and 3D data. • Generative AI: Prompt-based creation of environments, assets, and logic. • AI Robotics & Agentic AI: Autonomous avatars functioning as digital employees. • Spatial Computing: Cross-platform tools enabling real-time interactive applications. • Education & Training: No-code modules for simulations, learning, and workforce training. • Enterprise Applications: Collaboration, data visualization, and AI copilots for operations. • AI-Powered Avatars: Deployable assistants in retail, healthcare, and digital services. Core Components of the Platform • VR AI Builder – zero-code creation engine (prompt-to-assets/logic/worlds). Users can build maps, games, training modules, and enterprise automations. NFTs Land-gated publishing to VR/mobile/desktop; subscriptions + marketplace tie-ins. • AI Hub – scalable orchestration layer integrating multiple AI models (text, image, 3D). Powers prompt-to-world, prompt-to-texture, and prompt-to-3D object pipelines, and provides a no-code agent factory (persona, tools, memory, knowledge). • AI Avatars (agents) – autonomous “AI employees” with memory, personality, tool use, and multilingual conversation. Deployable across education, retail, healthcare, operations, and collaboration. • AI Verse — The networked runtime and economy layer for worlds and agents. Runs on a hybrid production cloud + decentralized participation, provides identity and access (profiles, land-gating), payments and participation rewards, telemetry/analytics, moderation/compliance, and asset/model/dataset catalogs with interoperability and SDKs/APIs for creators and enterprises. • Magic Madness – flagship PvP on-boarding game (Steam) used as a growth funnel (tournaments, esports, cosmetics) into the Builder/Agents/NFTs Land economy. Target Audiences • Independent creators & studios – zero-code content creation. • Brands & retail – virtual storefronts, AI-powered customer service. • Education & training providers – simulations and AI tutors. • Enterprises – AI copilots, collaboration environments, and spatial data rooms. • General users – immersive applications with built-in onboarding experiences. Why It Matters • Time-to-content collapses: Creation cycles shrink from weeks to hours. • Accessibility: Zero-code tools and cross-device access reduce entry barriers. • Economy with utility: $VR token underpins transactions, subscriptions, and rewards. • Sustainability: Utility-driven design replaces speculative models. • Market alignment: Positioned across AI infrastructure, spatial computing, and agentic AI—sectors forecasted to exceed $1 trillion in the next decade","links":"https://victoriavr.com/","market_cap":34265917,"market_cap_rank":817,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/victoria-vr_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x7d5121505149065b562c789a0145ed750e6e8cdd","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x7d5121505149065b562c789a0145ed750e6e8cdd"}},"is_native":false}
