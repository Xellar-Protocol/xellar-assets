{"name":"HYDRA","id":"hydra-3","symbol":"hydra","description":"Hydra's design is improved over its predecessors in the following ways: Hydra's LP is paired with DragonX: Hydra borrows the price appreciation of DragonX because the tokens are bonded together. DragonX is a deflationary token with programmatic buy and burn, tokens that are paired with it historically have done very well. Hydra mining uses TitanX: Unlike Hyper and TitanX, which require ETH to start miners, Hydra uses TitanX. Because there is so much TitanX in circulation, users can participate without selling TitanX down to Ethereum. This will enhance participation. Hydra uses the DragonX vault: Possibly the most distinct and important element to Hydra is its mechanism for burning TitanX. Rather than using a standard burn by sending tokens to the dead address, Hydra sends its burned TitanX to the DragonX vault, increasing the DragonX share of the TitanX Ethereum payouts. Hydra burns DragonX directly: The Hydra protocol sets aside a percentage of the TitanX used to start miners to burn DragonX off the market. This reduced the supply of DragonX forever it also makes the DragonX based buy and burn more effective. Hydra favors short compounding cycles: Unlike Hyper and TitanX which gave bonuses to early adopters, Hydra favors users that compound their proceeds over time. Hydra leaves more for new entrants and boosts miner profitability over the long term.","links":"https://app.hydra.win","market_cap":4725326,"market_cap_rank":2390,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/hydra-3/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xcc7ed2ab6c3396ddbc4316d2d7c1b59ff9d2091f"}}}
