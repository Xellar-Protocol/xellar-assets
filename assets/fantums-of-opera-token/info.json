{"name":"Fantums of Opera","id":"fantums-of-opera-token","symbol":"foo","description":"FOO is the Fantum universe utility token. The Fantum universe is an NFT gaming universe on the Fantom blockchain that includes multiple NFT collections such as Fantums (the first ERC721 NFT collection on the Fantom blockchain), Gothums, and yet to be released future collections. The collections can participate in various play to earn games such as PvP dueling and trick or treating. Future products are anticipated to further develop the Fantum universe itself, and involve various interactions between current and future collections within the Fantum universe. FOO is bought back and burned any time a Fantum is minted, traded on the Fantum universe NFT market, or participates in a duel. FOO is also required for participating in dueling. FOO is also bought back and burned when a Gothum is minted or traded on the Fantum universe NFT market. The Fantum universe further includes a farm for farming FOO-FTM LP from Sushi, single staking for FOO, as well as unique collector guides which facilitate users in completing their Fantums and Gothums attribute collections. Future Fantum universe products are expected to have tie-ins to FOO utilization in some form.","links":"https://fantums.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/fantums-of-opera-token/logo.png"}
