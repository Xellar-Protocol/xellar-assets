{"name":"Triathon","id":"dungeon-token","symbol":"geon","description":"Dungeon token (GEON) is a platform token for Triathon. Triathon is a gamified, decentralized, community-driven testing and auditing framework for blockchains and decentralized applications. It is part of the Trias ecosystem and acts as a launchpad and incubator for new blockchain projects. GEON is the native token utility that is used for: Building NFT and swapping tokens of the new ITO projects, increasing the health points of NFT in the game, and rewarding users in the Staking test - Farm. Game Battle: The reward gained from the game battle will be paid by GEONs. NFT Building: The GEON will be spent when users upgrade NFT. Higher-level NFTs have more health points and are more combat effective. Thus, their owners can obtain more GEON tokens in the Staking. ITO Launching: With the comprehensive test by global users, if the project passes the verification of the platform, then it can start the initial offering activities. The GEON holders can get a quota of the new project and swap GEONs for new project tokens.","links":"https://www.triathon.space","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dungeon-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x167fcfed3aad2d11052fcde0cbf704d879939473"}}}
