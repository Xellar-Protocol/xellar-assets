{"name":"Five Pillars Token","id":"five-pillars-token_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"5pt","description":"A deflationary, asset-backed token on BSC combining sustainable staking rewards with real-world asset integration. Five Pillars Token (5PT) is a community-driven digital asset built on Binance Smart Chain, designed to merge the benefits of decentralized finance with real-world value. The project introduces a deflationary staking mechanism in which 100% of staked tokens are permanently burned, reducing supply and creating scarcity while delivering daily rewards through smart-contract automation. The Five Pillars ecosystem is supported by five asset classes: precious metals, digital currencies, real estate, equity participation, and transaction fee-based ventures. This structure anchors the token in both physical and digital value, offering long-term sustainability beyond speculation. The platform features nine progressive staking pools, referral-based network multipliers, and enterprise-grade security. Smart contracts are triple-audited, fully open source, and designed with immutable core logic to eliminate risks of centralized control. Liquidity is permanently locked, further strengthening security and transparency. The roadmap includes the rollout of crypto debit cards, a decentralized marketplace, community incentive programs, and a lottery system, expanding utility for 5PT holders. By integrating multiple income streams with sustainable tokenomics, Five Pillars Token aims to establish itself as a benchmark for asset-backed DeFi solutions, prioritizing community empowerment and long-term value creation.","links":"https://www.fivepillarstoken.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/five-pillars-token_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe6cae4094352a670c3eb0fcbda17c898b71c7f2a","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xe6cae4094352a670c3eb0fcbda17c898b71c7f2a"}},"is_native":false}
