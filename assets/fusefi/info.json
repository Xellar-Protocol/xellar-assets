{"name":"Voltage Finance","id":"fusefi","symbol":"volt","description":"Voltage Finance is a decentralized trading protocol, known for its role in facilitating automated trading of decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens on the Fuse network. Voltage Finance aims to keep token trading automated and completely open to anyone who holds tokens while improving the efficiency of trading versus that on traditional exchanges. Voltage Finance has decided to take it a step further by creating and awarding its own governance token, VOLT, to past users of the protocol. This added both profitability potential and the ability for users to shape its future â€” an attractive aspect of decentralized entities.","links":"https://voltage.finance/","market_cap":327284,"market_cap_rank":5024,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/fusefi/logo.png","detail_platform":{"fuse":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x34ef2cc892a88415e9f02b91bfa9c91fc0be6bd4"}}}
