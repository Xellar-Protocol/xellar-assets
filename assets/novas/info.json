{"name":"XNL","id":"novas","symbol":"xnl","description":"Novastro is building a modular ledger layer for real-world assets (RWAs), anchoring issuance on Ethereum’s secure ledger while enabling high-performance trading across Arbitrum, Sui, and Solana networks. Designed as the ultimate bridge for RWA interoperability, Novastro’s multi-ledger architecture ensures universal access, eliminating silos and maximizing DeFi composability, surpassing single-chain constraints. Powered by the $XNL token, Novastro drives smart SPV-based tokenization, on-chain yield through stablecoins, and AI-optimized asset strategies. With automated compliance, decentralized sequencing, and comprehensive service provider integration, Novastro establishes the open, scalable ledger standard for global RWA markets. Hereʼs how $XNL drives the Novastro ecosystem: Native Gas Token: $XNL will be used to pay for transaction fees on Novastro, ensuring cost-effective operations while supporting scalability and high transaction throughput. Governance: $XNL token holders will have the power to participate in Novastroʼs decentralized governance, including decisions on network upgrades, parameter adjustments, and ecosystem funding. Staking: $XNL will power the staking mechanism for securing the Novastro network. The network relies on a network of nodes to check transactions to maintain network integrity, which would require token holders to stake their tokens to contribute to network maintenance and earn $XNL staking rewards for their contribution. Liquidity Provision: $XNL can be utilized as the base pair in liquidity pools across the Novastro ecosystem, providing active users with opportunities to contribute liquidity to support transactions, and earn additional rewards and benefits for their contribution. Protocol Fees: $XNL functions as the native platform currency — all fees across Novastroʼs ecosystem, including those for tokenized RWA transactions, can be paid in $XNL, further driving demand and enhancing utility. Digital Twin Integration: $XNL will serve as the core token for operating Digital Twin Containers (DTC), facilitating real-time RWA tokenization and lifecycle management, ensuring compliance and transparency.","links":"https://www.novastro.xyz/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/novas/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
