Chimeras includes a well-developed backstory that engulfs players with its lore. The vast fantasy world of Chimeras is populated with farmers, alchemists, merchants, killers, landowners, and socials. The islands and archipelagos of the metaverse stretch out in the middle of a boundless world ocean, with some islands having owners, while travelers and merchants surf the expanses of the universe in search of adventures and proﬁtable deals. The game also includes combat elements, as warriors are eager to ﬁght worthy rivals in arenas, while scientists compete for the breeding of the most amazing creatures in their laboratories. The players are rewarded with NFT-based items or CHIM tokens that can be used to breed the creatures, trading, building the virtual land plots in the game, as well as in battles.
