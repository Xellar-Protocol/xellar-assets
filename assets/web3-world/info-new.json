{"name":"Web3.World","id":"web3-world","symbol":"w3w","description":"Web3.World is a decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Venom blockchain. It allows users to exchange tokens through automated liquidity pools, and also offers customizable farming rewards for each pair. Users can create their own farming pools and set rewards with any tokens. Individual developers and projects can use the Builder section of the DEX to create their own tokens, while corporate partners can use the Vesting section to calculate and set up token distribution. Web3.World is fully decentralized and non-custodial, meaning funds are held in permissionless smart contract accounts that can only be withdrawn in exchange for another asset or by the liquidity owners in exchange for their Pool Tokens. The exchange's smart contracts are also fully permissionless and immutable, meaning any account can create a pool and no account has authority over the pool's assets or functionality, and the contracts cannot be updated or deleted. The exchange charges a standard fee of 0.3% for token swaps (0.15% for stablecoin swaps), but users who add liquidity to the platform can earn all swapping fees in the form of a fee reward for liquidity providers.","links":"https://web3.world","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/web3-world/logo.png","detail_platform":{"venom":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0:a53178ec8c6fe0c62413edd9eed25508f357cfba8bf8a7dbfad9290413b2e6be"}}}
