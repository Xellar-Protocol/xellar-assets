{"name":"Super Useless Token","id":"super-useless-token","symbol":"sut","description":"$SUT, short for Super Useless Token, is a playful and unique token central to the MORCHI mini-game experience. Players can earn $SUT by interacting daily with their MORCHI tapp, completing tasks like Chug Energy Drink, Gym Grind, and Cold Shower. $SUT serves multiple purposes within the game. It can be used to level up your MORCHI, with all tokens used for leveling being burned in the process. Additionally, $SUT is tradable on the DOOAR DEX, where it can be exchanged for GMT. The total supply of $SUT is capped at 66 million tokens, with 70% allocated to in-game rewards, 10% locked in a liquidity pool, and 20% reserved for the team and marketing events. As players level up their MORCHI, they burn $SUT but gain more rewards and higher earning potential. At every 5 levels, players can share an invite code with a friend to mint their own MORCHI. Special features are unlocked at Levels 10, 20, and 30, with significant earning increases at Level 10, and the ability to withdraw $SUT tokens starting at Level 20. Despite its playful name, $SUT is a crucial part of the MORCHI mini-game, adding both fun and strategic depth to the experience.","links":"https://morchi.mooar.com/","market_cap":662224,"market_cap_rank":4275,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/super-useless-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x57211299bc356319ba5ca36873eb06896173f8bc"}}}
