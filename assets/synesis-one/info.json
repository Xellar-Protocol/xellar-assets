In order to participate in these games and earn rewards, the gamers must stake Kanon NFTs. The data generated and validated by the ecosystem will be stored on the Solana blockchain and accessible to all, democratizing data and AI. In addition Kanon NFT owners will also earn claimable passive yield just by owning the Kanon NFTs.
