Synesis One will develop and launch various play-to-earn games ranging from hypercasual to mid-core games, that attract gamers of all demographics. In order to participate in these games and earn rewards, the gamers must stake Kanon NFTs. The data generated and validated by the ecosystem will be stored on the Solana blockchain and accessible to all, democratizing data and AI. In addition Kanon NFT owners will also earn claimable passive yield just by owning the Kanon NFTs. Each NFT will represent a word, and when the word is accessed/utilized by AI clients (e.g. Mind AI), then the holder of the NFT will get a part of the fee paid by the AI client.","links":"https://www.synesis.one/","market_cap":1344152,"market_cap_rank":3775,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/synesis-one/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"SNSNkV9zfG5ZKWQs6x4hxvBRV6s8SqMfSGCtECDvdMd","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/SNSNkV9zfG5ZKWQs6x4hxvBRV6s8SqMfSGCtECDvdMd"}}}
