The MELD token is a governance token enabling holders to vote on the development of the protocol.

Services offered by MELD include creating cryptocurrency-backed loans, earning an interest return for lending fiat to borrowers and participating in reward incentive programs. MELD will enable instant loans against cryptocurrency holdings at a competitive APR, or to receive a credit line and only pay interest on what you use.
