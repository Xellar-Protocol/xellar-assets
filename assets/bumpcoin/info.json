{"name":"BUMPCOIN","id":"bumpcoin","symbol":"bump","description":"BUMP is a Cardano-based memecoin inspired by the internet culture of absurdity, degen energy, and cult-like vibes. At the center of the BUMP universe is Bump the Yeti—a chill, arctic-dwelling degen who just wants to make bags, embrace the weird, and lead the bump cult into financial glory. Fueled by community, memes, and ice-cold conviction, BUMP isn’t just a coin—it’s a movement. The project emphasizes raw authenticity, meme virality, and strong community engagement, making it a unique cultural asset on Cardano. With a growing community, upcoming NFT drops, and meme-powered campaigns, BUMP aims to be a top-tier cultural token in the Cardano ecosystem.","links":"https://bumpcoin.cash/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bumpcoin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"cardano":{"decimal_place":3,"contract_address":"d628f6331d3536ff383b15de222bbf0792dacc0c9636aceda415de5942554d50434f494e"}}}
