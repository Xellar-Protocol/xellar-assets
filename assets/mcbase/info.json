{"name":"McBase","id":"mcbase","symbol":"mcbase","description":"Many attempts have been made to provide crypto with a source of liquidity tied to ever-changing inflation metrics (notably projects such as Frax Finance’s FPIS). That's why we introduce McBase McBase is the first ever inflation-pegged memecoin. The McBase protocol constitutes a new crypto asset pegged to the price of one of the world’s premier consumer products, the Big Mac. When the price of $MCBASE is higher than the target, the number of MCBASE’s tokens in user wallets automatically increases. When the price of $MCBASE is lower than the target, the number of MCBASE’s tokens in user wallets automatically decreases. Holders will soon be able to order physical Big Macs via the McBase Drive Thru + LP tokens can be staked in the \"Sharebox\" to receive additional $MCBASE.","links":"https://mcbase.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mcbase/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x43a9c989597efeadf11faec609ad8df7d3c18cdb"}}}
