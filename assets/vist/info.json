Our platform provides a convenient and comfortable mechanism for Creators / Streamers to maximise their revenue, similar to Patreon or Fanhouse, but with an advanced feature set and a completely new business model that provides Creators with significantly greater revenue than is possible on any other platform. VIST provides greater protection, more revenue and access to new growth opportunities that simply do not exist elsewhere. A recent survey found that 89% of all Creators are looking for a new radical way of doing business. This is VIST, this is the future of the Creator Economy.","links":"https://www.vist.nz/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/vist/logo.png"}
