Meanwhile, the Arts section presents a rich digital gallery filled with evocative illustrations featuring FIXI in a variety of scenes — futuristic landscapes, introspective moments, and powerful symbolic compositions. Through this blend of personal narrative and visionary visuals, FIXI.art transforms a creator’s healing journey into a universal metaphor for transformation and perseverance.","links":"https://fixi.art/","market_cap":26630,"market_cap_rank":9225,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/fixi_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"G1FhY1k9S4Q8P7zpuaQAnzZ1YGwwyiVRQF7EHncMpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/G1FhY1k9S4Q8P7zpuaQAnzZ1YGwwyiVRQF7EHncMpump"}},"is_native":false}
