{"name":"Databricks AI","id":"databricks-ai","symbol":"dbrx","description":"DBRX, our new, open source foundation model, sets the standard for quality and efficiency. DBRX outperforms all established open models in quality benchmarks and allows you to quickly build your own custom LLM on your data. Databricksâ€™ mission is to deliver data intelligence to every enterprise by allowing organizations to understand and use their unique data to build their own AI systems. Today, we are excited to advance our mission by open sourcing DBRX as a token and a general purpose large language model (LLM) built by our Mosaic Research team that outperforms all established open source models on standard benchmarks. We believe that pushing the boundary of open source models enables generative AI for all enterprises that is customizable and transparent. We are excited about DBRX for three distinct reasons. First, it handily beats open source models, such as, LLaMA2-70B, Mixtral, and Grok-1 on language understanding, programming, math, and logic. In fact, our open source benchmark Gauntlet contains over 30 distinct state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks and DBRX outperforms all those models. This shows that open source models are continuing to improve in quality, a trend that we are proud to play our part in.","links":"https://www.databricks.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/databricks-ai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
