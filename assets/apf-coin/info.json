The APF DIGITAL AGRIFUND CR in cooperation with MIA INVESTMENTS GROUP aims to combine the benefits of digital assets with the benefits of real investments in agricultural land.

Combining the benefits of digital assets with the benefits of real investments in agricultural land History of your project. 03/2023 Whatâ€™s next for your project? APF GROUP is a family-owned company primarily engaged in investments in agricultural land in the Czech Republic. We currently own agricultural land with a total value of over CZK 100 million. The purchase of land is carried out continuously on the basis of predetermined parameters (location, area, location of the land in the cadastral area, land quality, lease conditions, other legal defects). The long-term goal is to gradually consolidate the land in each locality into whole blocks of land intended for agricultural use in cooperation with tenants (farmers and agricultural companies). What can your token be used for? The funds raised through the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) of the APFC token will be used in accordance with the long-term strategy of APF GROUP and will offer clients the opportunity to participate in specific projects in the future. At the same time, the APFC project may offer an alternative for other agricultural investors from other countries and continents to secure funding for their projects.","links":"https://apfdigitalagrifund.com/en/","market_cap":38832243,"market_cap_rank":676,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/apf-coin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8ed955a2b7d2c3a17a9d05daca95e01818f8c11e"}}}
