{"name":"Trader","id":"trader","symbol":"tde","description":"The Trader token was developed to enable semi-automatic self-valuation. The token appreciation process occurs as follows: Transaction fees are charged on all token movements. These fees are mostly used to purchase assets, aiming at short, medium and long-term profits, which will be reinvested in the project. A portion of the profit obtained from the project's investments will be used to purchase the Trader token itself, which will be sent to a burn/destroy wallet, making the token more scarce. To optimize the profits that the project can offer to investors, a long-term investment approach is recommended, ideally for a full crypto asset market cycle, which lasts approximately four years.","links":"https://tokentrader.site/","market_cap":1123915,"market_cap_rank":3535,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/trader/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x86da4b72f0ce7a9d263263f521f37b3aa9a996d4"}}}
