{"name":"Kaddex","id":"kaddex","symbol":"kdx","description":"Kaddex is the first truly scalable, gas-free, proof-of-work secure DEX, all while being accessible and user-friendly. Kaddex exists to deliver the true vision of decentralized finance by creating end-to-end financial tools that are user-focused, accessible to all, scalable, sustainable, and decentralized. This means accessibility in cost and simplicity, tools that are deeply integrated, and decentralization of everything from the website and swap platform, to the establishment of the DAO, to creating sustainable liquidity mining and staking programs. Achieving this vision goes well beyond Kaddex as a gas-free DEX and is about positioning Kadena to be the center of DeFi adoption.","links":"https://kaddex.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kaddex/logo.png","detail_platform":{"kardiachain":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
