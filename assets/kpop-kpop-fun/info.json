{"name":"KPOP (kpop.fun)","id":"kpop-kpop-fun","symbol":"kpop","description":"KPOP is a deflationary memecoin launched on Solana. The cryptocurrency was created as a tribute to the KPOP culture that has taken the world by storm. The project aims to capitalize on the popularity of meme coins, like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, and strives to establish itself as one of the top meme-based cryptocurrencies. KPOP appeals to the cryptocurrency community by instituting a no-tax policy, being a fair launch, and being up-front about its lack of utility, keeping things pure and simple as a memecoin. The KPOP roadmap features three phases, where phase one includes listing on Cube Exchange and CoinMarketCap, and hosting local DJ/KOL community events, while phase two includes listing on additional centralized & decentralized exchanges (CEXs) and phase three includes “tier 1” exchange listings.","links":"https://www.kpop.fun","market_cap":5116544,"market_cap_rank":2384,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kpop-kpop-fun/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"4RdyA2XGc6v7RW1jcKG6AYDsjeUWZqkLHTNp2ghvdg7f"}}}
