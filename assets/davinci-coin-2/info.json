{"name":"DaVinci Coin","id":"davinci-coin-2","symbol":"dcoin","description":"DaVinci Chain, a Layer 1 blockchain built with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility and an identical consensus mechanism to Ethereum. Our goal is to provide a seamless and efficient blockchain environment that maintains the decentralization, security, and flexibility of the Ethereum network while offering a dedicated infrastructure for developers and users. As blockchain technology evolves, the need for Ethereum-compatible networks continues to grow. Our blockchain enables developers, businesses, and users to benefit from the vast ecosystem of Ethereum without dealing with congestion or high transaction fees. By mirroring Ethereum’s architecture, we ensure: ✅ Full EVM Support – Deploy smart contracts, dApps, and tokens (ERC-20, ERC-721, etc.) just as you would on Ethereum. ✅ Identical Consensus Mechanism – Our blockchain employs the same consensus model as Ethereum, ensuring decentralization and security. ✅ Seamless Interoperability – Compatible with Metamask, Web3.js, Hardhat, Truffle, and other Ethereum tools. ✅ Scalability & Customization – While maintaining Ethereum’s architecture, our network allows for tailored optimizations and governance.","links":"https://davinci.bz","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/davinci-coin-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":null}}}
