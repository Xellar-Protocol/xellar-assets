{"name":"AI Agent Layer","id":"ai-agent-layer","symbol":"aifun","description":"AI Agent Layer facilitates a dynamic ecosystem of autonomous AI agents. The platform enables the creation of AI agents using data from X and user-provided information, with each AI Agent tokenized and integrated with the ecosystemâ€™s native token, $AIFUN. Users can create AI Agents based on personalized Twitter personas or custom descriptions. Each AI Agent is tokenized by default, with its token becoming tradable on decentralized exchanges when the bonding curve reaches 100%. Additionally, every AI Agent creation and purchase contributes to the $AIFUN liquidity pool.","links":"https://aiagentlayer.com/","market_cap":20601854,"market_cap_rank":1333,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ai-agent-layer/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xbdf317f9c153246c429f23f4093087164b145390"}}}
