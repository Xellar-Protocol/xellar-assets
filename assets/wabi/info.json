{"name":"Wabi","id":"wabi","symbol":"wabi","description":"Wabi ecosystem connects Brands and Consumers, enabling a seamless, fair, and confidential exchange of value and information. Consumers participating in the ecosystem take advantage of the several tools designed to better inform their consumption choices and are incentivized with Wabi. Consumers redeem the tokens at a dedicated Marketplace where they can purchase thousands of unique products delivered to them from across the globe. Participating Brands leverage Wabi tokens to obtain unique datasets on consumer behaviour allowing them to make superior marketing and strategic decisions. Moreover, the Brands incentivise users with Wabi to generate new data, thus enabling rapid hypothesis testing and iteration. Effectively, Wabi taps into corporate marketing budgets ($1.6 â€“ $1.9 trillion annually), making marketing a lot more efficient for participating companies. What is WABI tokenomics? With growth of the ecosystem the circulating supply is reduced since for every point issued to consumers one WABI get taken out of the circulation. As of 16 November 2020, over 3,000,000 WABI have been locked out of circulation with growth of the WABI ecosystem.

The two founders first met in high school and after studying at the London School of Economics pursued careers in consulting at McKinsey and Bain respectively. Having worked on several important cases in the Consumer Goods industry, the two became convinced that there should be a more effective way to do marketing and that the inefficiencies in the FMCG industry that often resulted in public health risk were completely solvable with technology and determination.","links":"https://wabi.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wabi/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x286bda1413a2df81731d4930ce2f862a35a609fe"}}}
