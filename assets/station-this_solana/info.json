Built on Telegram, it enables on-chain art creation and accessibility via mobile devices, allowing users to unlock and interact with blockchain-based art directly on their phones. Already adopted by communities like @MogCoinEth and @spx6900, it supports NFT projects such as Wifeystation, making it a versatile tool for the crypto space. Combining advanced AI-driven content creation with seamless integration into existing platforms, it bridges the gap between memetics and blockchain technology.","links":"https://www.miladystation2.net/","market_cap":49356,"market_cap_rank":8241,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/station-this_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"AbktLHcNzEoZc9qfVgNaQhJbqDTEmLwsARY7JcTndsPg","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/AbktLHcNzEoZc9qfVgNaQhJbqDTEmLwsARY7JcTndsPg"}},"is_native":false}
