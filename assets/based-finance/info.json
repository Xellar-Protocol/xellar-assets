The protocolâ€™s underlying mechanism dynamically adjusts $BASED supply, pushing its price up or down relative to the price of $TOMB. The $BASED algorithmic token serves as the backbone of a rapidly growing ecosystem aimed towards bringing liquidity and new use cases to the $TOMB short term and $FTM ecosystem long term.
