The protocolâ€™s underlying mechanism dynamically adjusts $BASED supply, pushing its price up or down relative to the price of $TOMB. The $BASED algorithmic token serves as the backbone of a rapidly growing ecosystem aimed towards bringing liquidity and new use cases to the $TOMB short term and $FTM ecosystem long term. We aim to be the first fork to have multiple utilities for our native token $BASED.","links":"https://basedfinance.io/","market_cap":421765,"market_cap_rank":4772,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/based-finance/logo.png","detail_platform":{"fantom":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8d7d3409881b51466b483b11ea1b8a03cded89ae"}}}
