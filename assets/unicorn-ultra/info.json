{"name":"U2U Network","id":"unicorn-ultra","symbol":"u2u","description":"U2U Network is a DAG (Direct Acyclic Graph) based and EVM-compatible chain leverages Subnet technology to provide infinite scalability and perfect fit for DePIN U2U Network is made up of 2 core components: U2U Chain (U2U Chain) and U2U Subnet (U2U Subnet). U2U Chain is a DAG-based, EVM-compatible chain. Its uniqueness includes: DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) based: Using DAG as the core data structure rather than the traditional blockchain technology enables incredibly low latency and faster transaction finality time. aBFT (Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance): As a higher level of Byzantine Fault Tolerance, aBFT is the most secure consensus mechanism known today. DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake): A modified version of Proof of Stake that offers higher efficiency, decentralization, and is more environmentally-friendly. Built atop of U2U Chain, U2U Subnet is a disruptive scaling solution that makes unlimited scalability possible. By implementing an innovative technology called Universal Messages Verification (UMV) and OstracismVM - an original virtual machine, U2U Subnet is able to provide seamless connectivity and interoperability, hence a perfect solution for blockchain real-world applications.","links":"https://u2u.xyz/","market_cap":11006479,"market_cap_rank":1505,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/unicorn-ultra/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x558e7139800f8bc119f68d23a6126fffd43a66a6"}}}
