{"name":"Asko","id":"askobar-network","symbol":"asko","description":"The ASKO project originated in 2020, aimed to fuel a DeFi ecosystem but faltered due to a lack of viable products or services, leading to abandonment by its original creators in 2022. However, our dedicated marketing team, entrusted with revitalizing the project, recognized ASKO's potential as a meme coin with tangible utility. A New Vision for ASKO: Under new management, ASKO is evolving into a deflationary meme coin economy on Ethereum. ASKO is transitioning into a community-powered token that will support the creation and utility of the first meme coin price prediction market, marking ASKO as a pioneer in the meme coin space. ASKOBAR ZOO NFT Collection: As part of its evolution, ASKO plans to introduce the ASKOBAR ZOO NFT Collection, a unique offering that bridges the worlds of meme coins and NFTs. The NFTs serve as asset-backed derivatives of the ASKO token, granting holders access to prediction powers for popular meme coins. Within the ASKOBAR ZOO, holders will gain entry to meme coin price prediction markets and community voting mechanisms. ASKOBAR NFTs will empower holders with the ability to make informed decisions in the volatile meme coin market. Holders can leverage their prediction accuracy to receive variable discounts on swaps for popular meme coins on the ASKOBAR marketplace, supporting a symbiotic relationship between meme coin enthusiasts and the ASKO meme coin ecosystem.","links":"https://askolmarkets.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/askobar-network/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xeeee2a622330e6d2036691e983dee87330588603"}}}
