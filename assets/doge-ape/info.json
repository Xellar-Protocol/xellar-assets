{"name":"Doge Ape","id":"doge-ape","symbol":"dogeape","description":"DogeApe is an Dogechain token on the new Dogechain blockchain. It has a 10% tax on every transaction. 2% of that tax is transferred back to wallet holders in a form of reflections to encourage holding. DogeApe is a fully decentralized community project, with no team allocation at launch. DogeApe will simplify the way users from other chains interact with the Dogechain with its unique DogeApe Bridge that will make it possible to bridge BNB (Or any EVM compatible blockchain) to wDoge automatically. In addition to that, DogeApe will be home of DogeApeSwap, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform offering a full suite of tools to explore and engage with the future of wealth building. DogeApeSwap will be mainly focused on the Dogechain, offering its users a smooth trading experience","links":"https://dogeape.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/doge-ape/logo.png"}
