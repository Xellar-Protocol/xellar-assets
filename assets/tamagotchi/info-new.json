{"name":"Tamagotchi","id":"tamagotchi","symbol":"gotchi","description":"The \"Tamagotchi Token\" on the Solana blockchain is a playful and nostalgic nod to the classic digital pet of the 1990s. It capitalizes on the recent trend of meme tokens, which often blend humor, internet culture, and cryptocurrency speculation. Unique to the Solana ecosystem, it offers fast and low-cost transactions, leveraging Solana's high throughput and scalability. While the token primarily serves as a fun and speculative asset, its association with the Tamagotchi brand evokes a sense of nostalgia and community among users. However, like many meme tokens, its value and longevity are highly speculative and subject to the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market.","links":"https://gotchisol.xyz","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/tamagotchi/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":"J3Tzem78WsdZb3y48miXzjSDGLfitv68EK2Xk3vZmn4H"}}}
