{"name":"The Protocol","id":"the-protocol","symbol":"the","description":"The Protocol ($THE) is an ERC20 meme token that is inspired by Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of eth, tweet. On October 14, 2022, Vitalik tweeted the following: \"Someone should make a project called \"THE Protocol\", so that their shills can say \"Look, soandso mentioned THE!\" pretty much any time anyone says anything.\" The founders of $THE responded to the tweet by launching The Protocol. Ever since its launch, Vitalik has interacted with $THE tweets, allowing the token to prosper. The protocol quickly became a community effort, with 0% taxes and a renounced contract.","links":"https://theprotocoloff.com","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/the-protocol/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0cba60ca5ef4d42f92a5070a8fedd13be93e2861"}}}
