The smart commodity money with a unique elastic supply protocol. AMPL supply expands and contracts in response to it’s price deviating from a 1 USD target. Deviations result in a supply change of AMPLs once every 24 hours, increasing or decreasing the number of tokens in each holder’s wallet pro-rata. Ampleforth is the only asset in the world with this elastic supply property, and therefore has counter-cyclical trading pressure and is uncorrelated with other digital assets such as Bitcoin.","links":"https://www.ampleforth.org/","market_cap":17328341,"market_cap_rank":1195,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ampleforth_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xd46ba6d942050d489dbd938a2c909a5d5039a161","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xd46ba6d942050d489dbd938a2c909a5d5039a161"}},"is_native":false}
