{"name":"t3rn","id":"t3rn","symbol":"trn","description":"What is the project about? t3rn is a multichain protocol that brings fail-safe, interoperable execution and smart contract composability to the Polkadot ecosystem and beyond. t3rn’s ultimate goal is to enable trust-free collaboration between blockchains and to create an ecosystem in which anyone can utilize and deploy an interoperable smart contract, in an ecosystem where developers are fairly rewarded for their contributions. Turn multichain with t3rn. What makes your project unique? Interoperable. Connect to the most widely adopted blockchains in the world through our unique Gateway solution. Fail-safe. A transaction can be reverted if it fails at any point, therefore guaranteeing successful cross-chain execution. Composable. Cross-chain transactions can compose from one another, allowing for complex executions involving multiple blockchains. On-Chain rewards. Anyone can use smart contracts stored in our open source registry, while developers get paid when users utilise their code. History of your project. t3rn has been created to offer a fresh approach to the problem of blockchain interoperability (the ability for blockchains to communicate and interact with one another). The ultimate goal of the t3rn project is to enable trust-free collaboration between blockchains and harness this synergy to create an ecosystem in which anyone can utilise and deploy an interoperable smart contract, an ecosystem where developers are rightly rewarded for their contributions. What’s next for your project? https://www.t3rn.io/blog/t3rn-development-roadmap What can your token be used for? For staking, for submitting as payment for cross-chain transactions, and network security.","links":"https://www.t3rn.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/t3rn/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":null}}}
