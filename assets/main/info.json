{"name":"Main","id":"main","symbol":"main","description":"MAIN is a SocialFi network operated and owned by its users. MAIN is made up of thematic communities created and operated by the users themselves. Each community gets its own coins that anybody can buy and sell. The price of coins goes up when people buy them and goes down when people sell. Community coins reflect the value of a particular community and unlock many innovative ways to interact and monetize. On MAIN you can: – Do everything the same as in other social networks: make posts, comment, rate others users, create their own communities or join existing ones. – Get MAIN tokens for your activity on the platform or as rewards from other users. – Own communities right on the blockchain: buy and sell community coins, participate in governance and make money on their growth.","links":"https://main.community/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/main/logo.png"}
