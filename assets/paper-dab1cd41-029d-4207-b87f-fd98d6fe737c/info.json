Rather than using a public launch, the $PAPER token was launched exclusively to holders of the Acrocalypse NFT token, who continue to earn $PAPER via staking rewards. Since it's launch, $PAPER has become the token used to mint the Acrocalypse Spacecraft NFTs, and the only token used in the recently launched Acrocalypse Marketplace.","links":"https://acrocalypse.gitbook.io/acrocalypse/usdpaper/usdpaper","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/paper-dab1cd41-029d-4207-b87f-fd98d6fe737c/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x21018cbc9ad730542130be180b577b74db2a9397"}}}
