{"name":"$PAPER","id":"paper-dab1cd41-029d-4207-b87f-fd98d6fe737c","symbol":"$paper","description":"$PAPER is the base utility token throughout the paperhands ecosystem, with a focus on these key topics: Utility, Scarcity & Sustainability. Rather than using a public launch, the $PAPER token was launched exclusively to holders of the Acrocalypse NFT token, who continue to earn $PAPER via staking rewards. Since it's launch, $PAPER has become the token used to mint the Acrocalypse Spacecraft NFTs, and the only token used in the recently launched Acrocalypse Marketplace.","links":"https://acrocalypse.gitbook.io/acrocalypse/usdpaper/usdpaper","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/paper-dab1cd41-029d-4207-b87f-fd98d6fe737c/logo.png"}
