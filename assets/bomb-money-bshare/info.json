{"name":"Bomb Money BShare","id":"bomb-money-bshare","symbol":"bshare","description":"Bomb Shares or $BSHARE is the way we represent the value and shareholders trust of the Bomb Protocol and its ability to maintain peg to Bitcoin. During an expansion epoch the Boardroom mints $BOMB which is distributed proportionally to $BSHARE holders who are staked in the Boardroom. $BOMB is an algocoin which is designed to follow the price of BTC. Enjoy high yields normally only found on high risk assets, but with exposure to BTC instead! The $BOMB algorithmic token serves as the backbone of a rapidly growing ecosystem aimed towards bringing liquidity and new use cases to the BSC network. The protocol's underlying mechanism dynamically adjusts $BOMB's supply, pushing its price up or down relative to the price of $BTC. Inspired by tomb.finance, which was originally inspired by the idea behind Basis as well as its predecessors (bDollar and soup), bomb.money is a multi-token protocol which consists of the following three tokens: -bomb.money ($BOMB). -BOMB Shares ($BSHARE). -BOMB Bonds ($BBOND). What differentiates $BOMB from other algorithmic tokens? Unlike previous algorithmic tokens, $BOMB is not pegged to a stable coin â€” it is instead pegged to $BTC. Because of BTCs high per coin price, we have decided to peg BOMB to BTC at a 10,000:1 ratio. In other words, 10,000 BOMB should equal 1 BTC for our PEG to be maintained. One of the primary shortcomings of past algorithmic tokens has been a lack of use cases, leaving no good reason for somebody to want to use or hold them. In order to successfully maintain the peg in the long-run, the BOMB team will maintain a focus on innovation around enhanced functionality and use cases.","links":"https://app.bomb.money/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bomb-money-bshare/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x531780face85306877d7e1f05d713d1b50a37f7a"}}}
