{"name":"Intrepid Token","id":"intrepid-token","symbol":"int","description":"INT is the token of Intrepidgains community DAO. The current utility will allow holders to access a proprietary application. The app operates by employing mathematical correlations, utilizing formulas such as Bayes' theorem, to analyze the relationship between a project's performance and its fundamental attributes. We collect data on a project at a specific point in time, examining how various attributes relate to its performance. The app assigns scores to projects: higher scores indicate a positive correlation with attributes historically associated with higher return on investment (ROI), while lower scores suggest a link with attributes typically leading to poor performance.","links":"https://explorer.intrepidgains.com/","market_cap":817831,"market_cap_rank":2866,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/intrepid-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa2762ba628b962f93498d8893b6e4346140fe96d"}}}
