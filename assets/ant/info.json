{"name":"ANT","id":"ant","symbol":"ant","description":"BNB Mainnet ‘ANT Meme Project’ for Mars ‘Riding the chart’ to Meet Doge on Mars! Ants get to Mars by chart! We Need to help!! Introduction Ant decided to meet Doge on Mars. Doge is likely to reach Mars soon, but there was no way for ants to go. Ant and Doge issued ANT Coin to keep their promise to meet on Mars together, asking for your help. Based on the initial listing price, the chart rises or falls. Ant rides a chart, comes out from above the ground, goes to Mars, or goes underground. We need to help ants go to Mars. I hope Ant can ride the chart and go beyond living on the ground and ride the chart to Mars. Help ants live on Mars land, too. If you get to Mars, ants will be happy on or off the ground.","links":"https://ant-coin.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ant/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xba1c917598ac2d3690a7884dd126c63dfcaeb2b3","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xba1c917598ac2d3690a7884dd126c63dfcaeb2b3"}}}
