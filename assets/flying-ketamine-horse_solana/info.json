{"name":"Flying Ketamine Horse","id":"flying-ketamine-horse_solana","symbol":"fkh","description":"The Flying Ketamine Horse is a surreal meme icon born from the internet’s most chaotic imagination—an over-the-top, cartoonish brown horse soaring through a bright blue sky with exaggerated wings, a goofy lolling red tongue, and a comically placed syringe symbolizing its hallucinatory, dream-like state. Blending equine fantasy with absurd, psychedelic meme culture, this character represents unfiltered escapism, surreal humor, and the unhinged creativity of online communities. The logo captures this energy with vibrant clouds, expressive animation style, and a horse in full mid-air gallop, embracing a world where logic bends and the meme always flies higher.","links":"https://flyingketaminehorse.site/","market_cap":6098009,"market_cap_rank":1927,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/flying-ketamine-horse/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"BCXpjsHYmgVpRKdv4EQv1RARhYagnnwPkJjYbvM6bonk","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/BCXpjsHYmgVpRKdv4EQv1RARhYagnnwPkJjYbvM6bonk"}},"is_native":false}
