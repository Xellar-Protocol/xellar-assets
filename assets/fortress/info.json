{"name":"Fortress Loans","id":"fortress","symbol":"fts","description":"Fortress is an algorithmic money market, and synthetic stable coin protocol designed to bring secure and trustless credit and lending to users on Binance Smart Chain. Fortress enables investors to lend and/or borrow cryptocurrencies, by pledging the platform an over-collateralized amount of cryptocurrency. Fortress does this by utilizing money markets, which are pools of assets with algorithmically derived interest rates, based on the supply and demand of each asset. Users who choose to supply liquidity to Fortress earn compounded interest as rewards for supplying their assets to the protocol. When supplying assets, users are also given the ability to mint stable-coins, or borrow other assets against their supplied assets. Once a user has supplied assets to Fortress, the user can then borrow assets or mint stable-coins, by over-collateralizing and paying interest on the amount borrowed. Loans from the Fortress protocol do not have monthly payments, late fees, and can be paid off at any time. Fortress is able to do this without ever requiring a credit check, with near immediate origination, using smart contracts that provide an automated, and absolutely transparent system for investment and profit distribution.","links":"https://fortress.loans/","market_cap":20254,"market_cap_rank":9931,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/fortress/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x4437743ac02957068995c48e08465e0ee1769fbe","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x4437743ac02957068995c48e08465e0ee1769fbe"}}}
