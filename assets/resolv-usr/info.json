{"name":"Resolv USR","id":"resolv-usr","symbol":"usr","description":"Resolv is a protocol that maintains USR, an overcollateralized stablecoin natively backed by Ether (ETH). USR achieves its peg by hedging its collateral pool and maintaining a tokenized insurance fund called RLP. Users can stake USR to obtain the yield-bearing version called stUSR. USR is minted by depositing liquid assets, such as USDC or USDT, on 1:1 value basis. When USR is redeemed, a user receives a 1:1 equivalent to the notional amount.","links":"https://www.resolv.xyz/","market_cap":236483377,"market_cap_rank":252,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/resolv-usr/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x66a1e37c9b0eaddca17d3662d6c05f4decf3e110"},"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x35e5db674d8e93a03d814fa0ada70731efe8a4b9"},"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x2492d0006411af6c8bbb1c8afc1b0197350a79e9"}}}
