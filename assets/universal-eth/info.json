{"name":"Universal ETH","id":"universal-eth","symbol":"unieth","description":"Bedrock's native tokenized version of staked Ether is known as uniETH. uniETH represents the staked ETH in Bedrock plus all future staking rewards. uniETH is non-rebasing, i.e. does not grow in quantity over time but grows in value instead. In other words, 1 uniETH will be worth more than 1 ETH as time goes on, and its value will continue to increase as more time passes. Launched by RockX, Bedrock is a non-custodial solution that satisfies the requirements of institutions seeking a basis for large-scale liquid staking. By bringing new levels of transparency and security to liquid staking, Bedrock allows institutions to unlock liquidity safely by adhering to regulations while leveraging a true crypto-native solution.","links":"https://unieth.rockx.com","market_cap":58203937,"market_cap_rank":729,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/universal-eth/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf1376bcef0f78459c0ed0ba5ddce976f1ddf51f4","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xf1376bcef0f78459c0ed0ba5ddce976f1ddf51f4"},"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x3d15fd46ce9e551498328b1c83071d9509e2c3a0","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/arbitrum/tokens/0x3d15fd46ce9e551498328b1c83071d9509e2c3a0"}}}
