{"name":"Origin Token","id":"origin-protocol_ethereum","symbol":"ogn","description":"Origin Protocol is one of Ethereum’s longest-standing DeFi projects, featuring a multichain feature set that unlocks vast opportunities for yield generation across the space. Origin’s products are built to be permissionless and composable, allowing for deep integration with novel primitives. All of Origin’s products streamline rewards to OGN stakers, cultivating a sustainable, user-first offering. OGN is the governance and value-accrual token for Origin’s sprawling yield ecosystem. Users can stake OGN for xOGN, which carries voting and economic power across Origin’s product suite. Staking model: OGN can be locked on a time horizon of 1 month – 1 year. Users who stake OGN receive xOGN relative to the amount staked and the duration of the lock-up period. xOGN grants holders economic and voting rights during the staking period. Rewards: Origin takes a performance fee from its yield generating products. Half of this fee is distributed to OGN stakers in the form of extra rewards, while the remaining 50% funds the purchase of flywheel tokens to boost yield generated by the underlying protocols. Governance: OGN stakers comprise the Origin DAO, which votes on proposals and treasury allocations. Origin promotes fully on-chain governance to cultivate a sustainable, inclusive structure.","links":"http://www.originprotocol.com","market_cap":20547622,"market_cap_rank":1103,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/origin-protocol_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8207c1ffc5b6804f6024322ccf34f29c3541ae26","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x8207c1ffc5b6804f6024322ccf34f29c3541ae26"}},"is_native":false}
