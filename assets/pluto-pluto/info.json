{"name":"Pluto PLUTO","id":"pluto-pluto","symbol":"pluto","description":"Pluto is an innovative reserve currency design. It is a financial instrument resistant to bear markets that provides long-term and planned growth in the market price of an asset. The main metric of the protocol is the growth of the collateral value of each PLUTO token. The collateral is implemented by the Treasury, where parameters are controlled by voting, and can also change automatically depending on market figures. The mathematical model of Pluto is mostly focused on Treasury growth. It is built with this objective in mind.","links":"https://pluto.gold/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pluto-pluto/logo.png","detail_platform":{"waves":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"Ajso6nTTjptu2UHLx6hfSXVtHFtRBJCkKYd5SAyj7zf5"}}}
