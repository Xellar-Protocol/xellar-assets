{"name":"Packetchain","id":"packetchain","symbol":"ptcl","description":"PacketChain will introduce an open protocol called the Packet Protocol (“the Protocol”) that will improve the Internet’s trustworthiness and reputation. Using distributed ledger technology, PacketChain will decentralize its categorized and currently centralized registry of URIs to democratize the submission, validation and dispute processes for URIs. To enable the growth, development and utility of the Protocol, we are launching the PTCL Coin (the “Coin”). Once the Protocol is operational, PacketChain will be the foundation of a Tokenized economy that incentivizes users to behave appropriately, mitigating the risk of bad actors and reducing community security vulnerabilities.","links":"https://packetchain.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/packetchain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
