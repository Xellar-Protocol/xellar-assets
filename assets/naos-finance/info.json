{"name":"NAOS Finance","id":"naos-finance","symbol":"naos","description":"NAOS Finance facilitates DeFi lenders and SME borrowers to allow both parties to interact in a permission-less manner on the blockchain. We enable the origination and funding of loans without traditional intermediaries. NAOS Finance provides lenders with stable and recurring income streams while also connecting the on-chain world with much bigger off-chain opportunities. Ultimately, our goal is to fully automate the tokenization of real-world assets and make them available as part of the end-to-end lending process through NAOS Finance.","links":"https://naos.finance/","market_cap":314304,"market_cap_rank":5015,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/naos-finance/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x4a615bb7166210cce20e6642a6f8fb5d4d044496"},"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x758d08864fb6cce3062667225ca10b8f00496cc2"}}}
