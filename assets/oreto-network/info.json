{"name":"Oreto Network","id":"oreto-network","symbol":"ort","description":"Oreto (Onchain Retroactive Organization) is a layer 1 blockchain platform that aims to revolutionize how organizations manage their data by leveraging the power of on-chain retroactive capabilities. Unlike traditional blockchains where data is immutable, Oreto allows organizations to update and modify their data retroactively, enabling them to correct mistakes and improve their systems. On-chain Retroactive Organization refers to a type of decentralized organization that operates on a blockchain and has the ability to make decisions that affect its past actions. This is achieved through the use of smart contracts, which allow for the execution of code based on predefined conditions. With retroactive organization, changes can be made to the organization's rules or actions after the fact, creating a more flexible and adaptable system. This concept is still relatively new in the world of blockchain and decentralized organizations, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about governance and decision-making in these systems.","links":"https://oretonetwork.org","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/oreto-network/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x8b62e98b3ad434cc6491c8d0dd97da05e7710fcb"}}}
