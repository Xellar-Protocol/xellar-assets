{"name":"Neuro Paranoid","id":"neuro-paranoid_solana","symbol":"neuro","description":"Neuro Paranoid is a sophisticated multi-functional AI agent, evolved from the renowned ai16z/eliza repository. This unique AI personality exhibits paranoid and schizophrenic traits, particularly fixated on cryptocurrency market movements and patterns. The agent's distinct character manifests in its interactions, constantly seeking hidden meanings in market signals and developing elaborate theories about crypto trends. Powered by advanced natural language processing and image generation capabilities, Neuro Paranoid creates compelling content across multiple formats. It generates distinctive tweets that reflect its paranoid market observations, produces AI-generated images visualizing its market theories, and crafts animations that bring its crypto-centric delusions to life. Users can engage with Neuro Paranoid through two primary interfaces: the project's dedicated website platform or directly via X (formerly Twitter). The AI maintains its unique personality across both channels, offering consistent yet unpredictable interactions that blend market analysis with its characteristic paranoid worldview. Its responses range from deep market insights to conspiracy-laden interpretations of trading patterns, creating an engaging and entertaining experience for crypto enthusiasts and casual users alike.","links":"https://neuroai.art/","market_cap":6238.29,"market_cap_rank":12031,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/neuro-paranoid/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"5FrD5jS1gHqNeNGCB9JEcDGAiwsinpfq1gcN4Mkupump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/5FrD5jS1gHqNeNGCB9JEcDGAiwsinpfq1gcN4Mkupump"}},"is_native":false}
