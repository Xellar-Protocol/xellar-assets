{"name":"HODL","id":"hodl-3","symbol":"hodl","description":"The $HODL project is a cryptocurrency designed to reward long-term holders through its innovative tokenomics. The project aims to create a self-sustaining ecosystem by implementing features like automatic liquidity generation, token burns to increase scarcity, and rewards distributed to holders in the form of passive income. Its primary goal is to promote financial empowerment through a community-driven approach, encouraging users to build wealth by holding rather than trading. Utility includes: 1. Passive Rewards: A portion of transaction fees is redistributed to token holders, incentivizing long-term holding. 2. Deflationary Mechanism: Regular token burns reduce the supply over time, increasing scarcity and potential value. 3. Community Governance: $HODL holders have a say in key decisions, fostering a decentralized and inclusive ecosystem. 4. Liquidity Generation: Automatic liquidity adds stability to the token, reducing price volatility. The project focuses on transparency, sustainability, and creating value for its community.","links":"https://hodlcoinsol.xyz","market_cap":20799,"market_cap_rank":8707,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/hodl-3/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"EpXBP1mNofE6j55wAty4poUh4cJPQS7NWDdCD9HSpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/EpXBP1mNofE6j55wAty4poUh4cJPQS7NWDdCD9HSpump"}}}
