{"name":"FlyPaper","id":"flypaper","symbol":"sticky","description":"$STICKY is the FlyPaper utility token. It has a total supply of 500 million, no mint function, and rewards holders with 4% of each transaction while storing 2% of each transaction in the contract address indefinitely. FlyPaper's goal is to end DeFi scams through holistic project reviews and SHA-256 blockchain-secured certifications. The SwapMeet is the banner project of the FlyPaper ecosystem. If a project wishes to be listed on the SwapMeet, they must first be reviewed by the FlyPaper team, who then prepares an extensive report. The report is then published for the community of STICKY holders. Using the findings in the report, the community of holders uses STICKY-BNB LP tokens to vote on whether or not they think the project should receive Larry's Stamp of Approval. If approved, the project receives certification for 6 months. Upon expiration, the project must be reviewed and recertified to ensure compliance. If the project is certified, they will be able to display the Stamp of Approval as a trusted symbol on their website and listed as an approved project at the SwapMeet.","links":"https://www.flypaper.info/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/flypaper/logo.png"}
