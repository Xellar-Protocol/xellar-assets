When $SHARK stakers win their counter positions, they receive the winnings as staking rewards! In other words, Shark Protocol solves one of the biggest problems with price prediction applications, which is a bet becoming void if no one is betting against you. Therefore, when you participate on Shark Protocol, your predictions will always be active!
