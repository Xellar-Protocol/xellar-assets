Players use $DRUG to purchase BlockZ and will be able to earn $DRUG as they play, and drug activity operations are carried at their BlockZ. $DRUG can also be used to improve the stats of BlockZ through \"\"BlockZ Improvements”, by adding more buildings, landmarks, etc. Players will also be able to earn $DRUG when they carry out their drug operations, win battles or complete other activities in the game. Players can stake $DRUG by locking a certain amount of the currency in the in-game bank. By \"\"staking\"\" , players earn extra $DDZ, $DRUG, Land Improvement options and other rewards.
