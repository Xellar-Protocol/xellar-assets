{"name":"Simon the Gator","id":"simon-the-gator_ethereum","symbol":"simon","description":"Simon the Gator ($SIMON) is a community-driven ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain inspired by Matt Furie’s artistic style and themed around exposing and rejecting bad actors in the crypto space—commonly referred to as “ruggers” and “jeeters.” The project uses satire and bold visual branding to unite a community around transparency, accountability, and resilience in decentralized finance (DeFi). Simon the Gator’s ecosystem is centered on community engagement through social channels such as X and Telegram, where holders participate in discussions, campaigns, and meme-driven content that promote its core message of calling out market manipulation and fostering an authentic, self-aware crypto culture.","links":"https://simonthegator.com/","market_cap":18525.14,"market_cap_rank":9929,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/simon-the-gator_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x2328434559f7dec44373822cf68052de0d671b7f","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x2328434559f7dec44373822cf68052de0d671b7f"}},"is_native":false}
