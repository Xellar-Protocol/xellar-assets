{"name":"BRK690k","id":"brk690k","symbol":"brk","description":"BRK690k is a memecoin experiment inspired by the legendary growth of Berkshire Hathaway Class A stock ($BRK.A), which rose from $250 to $690k over four decades. Created by the fictional character Barren Wuffett, the project embraces humor, creativity, and innovation through its Price-Patterned Tokenomics™, exploring whether a stock-to-meme narrative can achieve similar growth. BRK690k is both a satirical commentary on traditional finance and a community-driven effort to blend memecoins and stock-inspired value trajectories.","links":"https://brk690k.com/","market_cap":52665,"market_cap_rank":7478,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/brk690k/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x364c65347bdd77e6196fad96d42dbbd6d55cf719","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x364c65347bdd77e6196fad96d42dbbd6d55cf719"}}}
