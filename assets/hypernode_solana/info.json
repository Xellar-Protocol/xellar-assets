{"name":"Hypernode","id":"hypernode_solana","symbol":"hyper","description":"Hypernode is a decentralized compute and AI deployment network built on Solana, designed to coordinate, deploy, and scale AI workloads across a distributed infrastructure. Through components like the Hypernode-AI-Deployer, the network automates model deployment, training, and scaling across connected nodes. The Hypernode-Facilitator manages task orchestration, communication, and reward allocation among sub-networks such as Hypernode.AI, Hypernode.Render, and Hypernode.Compute. At its core, the x402 protocol provides the communication and synchronization layer that connects these modules, enabling seamless distributed execution between nodes. The native token $HYPER powers all network layers — from compute payments and staking to governance, node validation, and automated reward distribution — forming the economic backbone of a decentralized ecosystem that bridges artificial intelligence and distributed computation","links":"https://hypernodesolana.org/","market_cap":4337.82,"market_cap_rank":12542,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/hypernode_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"92s9qna3djkMncZzkacyNQ38UKnNXZFh4Jgqe3Cmpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/92s9qna3djkMncZzkacyNQ38UKnNXZFh4Jgqe3Cmpump"}},"is_native":false}
