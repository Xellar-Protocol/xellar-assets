{"name":"Zentium Tech","id":"zentium-tech_ethereum","symbol":"zent","description":"Zentium is a next-generation AI-driven, no-code agent-building blockchain designed to revolutionize automation, interoperability, and decentralized intelligence. At its core, ZENT tokens serve as the lifeblood of the ecosystem How It Works 1. AI-Powered Smart Contracts On Zentium.tech, smart contracts go beyond simple rules. They use AI to process live data, spot trends, and adapt their actions. This means smarter automation for trading, security, and governance. For example, in trading, these contracts can review market conditions before acting. For security, they catch suspicious behavior and respond right away. In governance, they refine proposals using data-driven insights. This intelligent approach makes automation not just fast but also flexible and responsive, offering a better way to use blockchain. 2. Autonomous AI Agents (AGENTS) Zentium.tech’s AI Agents act as your digital assistant, always working in the background. These agents don’t just follow scripts—they process data, identify patterns, and make smart choices. They run 24/7, reacting to market changes or security risks faster than any person could. This keeps your blockchain interactions smooth, secure, and efficient, saving you time and effort. 3. Decentralized AI Computing with ZentCloud Zentium.tech exceeds centralized systems with ZentCloud, a network where computing power is spread across users. This setup lets you train and run AI models without relying on a single provider, ensuring your data stays private and transparent. 4. Earning Rewards through Proof-of-Intelligence (PoI) At Zentium.tech, contributing to AI isn’t about raw computing power—it’s about adding real value. With Proof-of-Intelligence (PoI), you earn rewards by running AI models, supporting agents, or sharing useful data. PoI focuses on the quality of your contributions, not just the strength of your hardware, making sure your efforts are recognized and fairly rewarded. 5. AI-Enhanced Governance Zentium.tech takes decentralized governance to the next level with Intelligent DAOs (IDAOs). Here, AI analyze proposals, predict outcomes, and improve voting processes. This makes governance more informed, efficient, and resistant to bias or manipulation. You stay in charge, but with AI providing insights that lead to fairer and smarter decisions.","links":"https://zentium.tech/","market_cap":11003.17,"market_cap_rank":10971,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/zentium-tech_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x2b37127988e4e5e9576b7a533d873c23cfbdb1e9","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x2b37127988e4e5e9576b7a533d873c23cfbdb1e9"}},"is_native":false}
