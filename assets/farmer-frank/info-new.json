{"name":"Farmer Frank","id":"farmer-frank","symbol":"frank","description":"Based Farmer Frank ($FRANK) is a farming protocol built on the $BASE blockchain. It allows users to earn rewards from other meme coins through a unique \"farming\" system. Users who buy and sell $FRANK gain \"Farm Points.\" More Farm Points entitle users to a larger share of meme coin rewards accumulated through a community-chosen \"farmed\" meme coin. A buy and sell tax on $FRANK transactions is used to collectively purchase the chosen meme coin. $FRANK offers users the potential to earn rewards from multiple meme coins through a single holding, benefit from the potential price appreciation of $FRANK itself, and participate in a community-driven meme coin farming strategy.","links":"https://www.basedfarmerfrank.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/farmer-frank/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"0x290814ad0fbd2b935f34d7b40306102313d4c63e"}}}
