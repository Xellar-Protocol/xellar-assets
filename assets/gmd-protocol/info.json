{"name":"GMD Protocol","id":"gmd-protocol","symbol":"gmd","description":"GMD Protocol is a yield optimizing and aggregating platform built on top of existing applications and GMD’s reserve token on Arbitrum. GMD employs delta-neutral or pseudo-delta-neutral strategies to aggregate yields from an index pool or an LP to its constituent individual assets, eliminating their risks of impermanent loss or exposure to unwanted assets. GMD’s first products are single-stake (BTC, ETH, USDC) vaults built on top of GMX and GLP. GMD’s reserve will earn yield from underlying backing $GLP and all revenue from single-stake vaults. In the future, besides yield-earning vaults, GMD also aims to leverage derivative platforms through smart vaults (long, short, news trading, social, etc..) and arbitrage pegged assets.","links":"https://gmdprotocol.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gmd-protocol/logo.png"}
