{"name":"Pledge","id":"pledge","symbol":"plgr","description":"Unlike most available lending protocols, Pledge won’t be focused on crypto traders borrowing digital assets in real-time for day trading. Instead, Pledge answers the need for longer-term financing, mainly serving crypto-asset holders to diversify their portfolio with non-crypto assets, e.g. real estate, without the friction of portfolio rebalancing. By reducing the exposure to interest rate volatility for borrowers/lenders, Pledge resolves the missing, core component in the existing DeFi world thus creates a decentralized lending market that will accelerate the adoption of DeFi apps in people’s daily financial activities.","links":"https://www.pledger.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pledge/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6aa91cbfe045f9d154050226fcc830ddba886ced"}}}
