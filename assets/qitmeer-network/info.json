In contrast to the competition model, BlockDAGâ€™s collaboration model in the mining achieves a desirable balance of typical blockchain metrics among the security, openness, fairness and scalability. Qitmeer adopts a classic POW consensus and UTXO data model and designs a unique asset issuing mechanism which requires the reserve of native currency, which is in line with core ethical financial values.","links":"https://www.qitmeer.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/qitmeer-network/logo.png"}
