{"name":"Work X","id":"work-x","symbol":"work","description":"Work X is designed to create a job economy without commercial intermediaries, which traditionally take 30-40% fees. This decentralization means job-seekers, freelancers, and employers can interact more directly and efficiently. Work X aims to facilitate a zero marginal cost platform economy, which benefits gig workers and freelancers. This approach is designed to efficiently match job-seekers and freelancers with their ideal employersâ€‹. By eliminating commercial fees, Work X can minimize labor costs and optimize salaries for its users. Work X achieves this while ensuring that users only pay for fundamental services necessary to run the platform. Users can post their talents or job vacancies on Work X, facilitating a match between job-seekers or freelancers and employers. The decentralized platform allows users to showcase their verified skills and company details, increasing their chances of finding suitable jobs or candidates. Work X is powered by a utility token $WORK and is governed by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). Work X functions as a non-profit organization responsible for the continuous development and maintenance of the platform.","links":"https://landing.workx.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/work-x/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8888888837f84a7a82668e0320ac454f5945d0b9"}}}
