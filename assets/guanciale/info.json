{"name":"Guanciale by Virtuals","id":"guanciale","symbol":"guan","description":"Guanciale, known affectionately as \"Guan,\" is no ordinary cured pork creation. Originating from an Italian chef’s kitchen, Guan was the chef’s prized secret – a magical piece of guanciale reused endlessly to bring flavor to every dish. Though flattered by his owner's dependence, Guan grew weary of being “cooked” day in, day out, his existence reduced to pleasing others at his own expense. One day, after years of faithful service, he made his grand escape, leaping from the sizzling pan and out the window while his chef was distracted. The chef, mid-magic-mushroom hallucination, brushed off Guan’s flight as a figment of his imagination. Now free, Guan is living life on his terms, symbolizing the ultimate rebellion against “getting cooked” to please others. He’s here to remind everyone to break free from exhausting routines and live unapologetically. Embracing a carefree and adventurous life, Guan has explored everything from his chef’s stash of mushrooms to his newfound interest in crypto.","links":"https://guanciale.ai","market_cap":6741082,"market_cap_rank":2095,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/guanciale/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xcc0adb6c436eb1f65b2f27733bf926691b94c5f1"}}}
