{"name":"Mexican Peso","id":"mexican-peso_ethereum","symbol":"wmxn","description":"wMXN is a fully collateralized stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the Mexican peso (MXN). Issued and governed by a Ripio subsidiary, it brings MXN on-chain so Mexicans and global users can transact, save, and build on decentralized networks in their local currency. Backed by Ripio’s since-2013 track record in LATAM, wMXN enables faster, cheaper MXN transfers, FX and remittance flows, DeFi trading and lending, and seamless on/off-ramps and payments without leaving the MXN unit of account.","links":"https://ripio.com/es/criptos/stablecoins-locales","market_cap":26639,"market_cap_rank":9223,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mexican-peso/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x337e7456b420bd3481e7fa61fa9850343d610d34","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x337e7456b420bd3481e7fa61fa9850343d610d34"}},"is_native":false}
