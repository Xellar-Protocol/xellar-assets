{"name":"Proof of Presence","id":"proof-of-presence","symbol":"pop","description":"POP is a meme-inspired, deflationary token built on the Base network. It distributes a portion of transaction fees back to holders as ETH whenever certain on-chain conditions are met. By design, POP uses a low transaction fee where 0.99% is converted into ETH for rewards, and 0.01% is burned to gradually reduce the total supply. The contract has been renounced, indicating no further modifications can be made by its creators. POP launched with a 100% fair approach on Uniswap (no ICO, presales, or private allocations).","links":"https://pop.restaurant/","market_cap":11114.62,"market_cap_rank":9468,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/proof-of-presence/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe12acf5bb21654195a498c2fbd49fff801a3a02d","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xe12acf5bb21654195a498c2fbd49fff801a3a02d"}}}
