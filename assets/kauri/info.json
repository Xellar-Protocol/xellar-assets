{"name":"Kauri","id":"kauri","symbol":"kau","description":"Kauri crypto project is developing link between \"\"offline\"\" and \"\"online\"\" world through tokenomics of ERC20 token Kauri. It’s been build on bases of the already working infrastructure of many “real-world“ assets (private reservations Avatar Eco Lodge and La PreciOsa in Costarica, luxury Yacht, many high-class apartments across the world, and others). Kauri tokens could be used: (a) To get access to those “real-world“ benefits within ecosystem's projects as user. This can be done through economic activity within the Kauri ecosystem (freezing KAUs or providing liquidity on the market). or (b) To participate in a specific ecosystem’s project as investor. This can be done by allocating tokens to get part of project’s profits.","links":"https://kauricrypto.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kauri/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"0xe172f366678ec7b559f6c2913a437baadfd4e6c8"}}}
