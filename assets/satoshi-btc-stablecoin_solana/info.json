{"name":"Satoshi BTC Stablecoin","id":"satoshi-btc-stablecoin_solana","symbol":"tsat","description":"tSAT is the first satoshi-denominated Bitcoin stablecoin built on Solana. Each token equals one satoshi (0.00000001 BTC), pegged 1:1 and backed by Threshold’s tBTC reserves. This allows people to interact with Bitcoin’s smallest unit on Solana’s high-speed, low-cost blockchain. The project was created to make Bitcoin savings and transactions more practical, clear, and accessible for everyday use, enabling users to measure progress in sats rather than tiny BTC decimals, while still retaining full Bitcoin backing and redeemability.","links":"https://satoshi15.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/satoshi-btc-stablecoin_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":2,"contract_address":"tSATdGGSLYBVCrm3pXiib8NmzKcB1iUdjRRseNGssxu","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/tSATdGGSLYBVCrm3pXiib8NmzKcB1iUdjRRseNGssxu"}},"is_native":false}
