{"name":"Cow Inu","id":"cow-inu","symbol":"ci","description":"A new crypto coin, developed by a community of developers with the vision to digitalize the conventional currencies in the non-profit segment. In ancient India, cow was considered a symbol of wealth and prosperity. The initial phases of the project will focus on streamlining digital transactions related to donations and dedications to non-charitable organizations and offerings to religious organizations. This segment needs digitalization and blockchain enablement to eradicate corruption and improve transparency in non-profit segments. Our first social application “AnAssurance.com“ will allow organizations to accept crypto currency online, track and monitor the genuine completeness of each transaction and its delivery to the right person or organization. The social app will verify and authenticate the organizations so benefactors will be rest assured that the donations and offerings reach the right place.","links":"https://www.cowinu.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cow-inu/logo.png"}
