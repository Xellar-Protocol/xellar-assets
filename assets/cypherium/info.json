Using a hybrid consensus mechanism that utilizes both Proof-of-Work and HotStuff, our blockchain is designed to achieve commercialization viability by maximizing both decentralization and scalability without sacrificing one for the other. Unlike many second- and third-generation blockchains that abandon Satoshi Nakamotoâ€™s original permissionless, trustless consensus mechanism, Cypherium is built on the valuable innovations of previous blockchains.","links":"https://www.cypherium.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cypherium/logo.png"}
