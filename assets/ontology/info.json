Ontology was created in 2017 by a Chinese company called OnChain, which is led by founders Erik Zhang and Da HongFei. OnChain has had huge success in the cryptocurrency industry, as they were also the founders behind the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/neo\">NEO</a> blockchain, which is now a multi-billion dollar project. Essentially, Ontology was created as a way for businesses of all sizes to install blockchain technology within their company, without having to completely change all of their current systems. The purpose of the Ontology framework is that it is not intended to operate as a single blockchain. Instead, the technology will allow businesses to make full use of both a private and public blockchain. Each and every data transaction is confirmed in a decentralized environment, meaning that no single person or authority can take control of the network.","links":"https://ont.io/","market_cap":253963028,"market_cap_rank":360,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ontology/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
