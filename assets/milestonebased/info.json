{"name":"milestoneBased","id":"milestonebased","symbol":"mile","description":"\"milestoneBased is on a mission to fix a legacy system of capital inefficiency by revolutionizing collaboration on roadmaps and funding between crypto investors and start-ups. We are the first company to leverage a blockchain DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) and smart contract escrow capabilities, in an automated governance and milestone management platform. VCs and early-stage investors achieve greater capital and process efficiency, better security, transparency, and data-driven insights for a faster path to liquidity and monetization of deployed funds. milestoneBased was started in 2018, incubated by venture builder and accelerator firm, Applicature, and led by a founding team of blockchain and the Startup industry veterans. The company is addressing a large early-stage Angel and VC funding market which reached over $17B in the first half of 2021. The revenue model includes a fee for funds allocated, funds withdrawn, yield farming revenue from funds in escrow, plus other revenue streams are planned. The platformâ€™s MILE token provides access to features, governance, community rewards and liquidity mining. Total token supply is 100 million MILE, initial liquidity and market cap at TGE is $75K, or a price of $ 0.10 USD. The tokonomics are designed to reward a loyal long term community.\"","links":"https://milestonebased.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/milestonebased/logo.png"}
