{"name":"Running Barn Owl","id":"running-barn-owl_solana","symbol":"ehhh","description":"“Ehhh Ehhh” is a Japanese onomatopoeic chant often used to express rhythmic effort when carrying something heavy, running, or working hard. It has a slightly playful and energetic tone, similar to ‘heave-ho’ in English, but can also be used in a more lighthearted or comical way. When a photograph of this Running Barn Owl was captured, it embodied this vibe perfectly. The meme got viral all over the internet, prompting the launching of this meme coin.","links":"https://pump.fun/coin/FS4xcBxLJbrrdXE1R6zHvKw8no4zrQn2rRFuczvepump","market_cap":9922.61,"market_cap_rank":11200,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/running-barn-owl_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"FS4xcBxLJbrrdXE1R6zHvKw8no4zrQn2rRFuczvepump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/FS4xcBxLJbrrdXE1R6zHvKw8no4zrQn2rRFuczvepump"}},"is_native":false}
