It functions as both a bridge and a mixer, optimizing liquidity provision across blockchain networks while ensuring transaction privacy. Utilizing advanced quantitative analysis, smart routing algorithms, and privacy-preserving techniques, QLix facilitates efficient and confidential asset transfers, enhancing the interoperability and fungibility of digital assets. QLix employs state-of-the-art cryptographic methods, including zero-knowledge proofs and other privacy-preserving protocols, to anonymize transactions. These techniques obfuscate the origins and destinations of digital assets, allowing users to enjoy a high level of privacy and security in their transactions, making the movement of assets across blockchains trace-resistant.","links":"https://www.qlixbot.io/","market_cap":71252,"market_cap_rank":4197,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/qlix/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0a907b0bbff60702b29a36b19718d99253cfbd9f"}}}
