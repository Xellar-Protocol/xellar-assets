{"name":"Etarn","id":"etarn_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"etan","description":"Etarn (ETAN) is a Web3 sustainability project that addresses global sanitation and agricultural challenges through its “Toilet-to-Earn” model. The project deploys smart toilets that can be installed quickly in urban and rural areas, transforming human waste into organic fertilizer for farming. In addition, Etarn generates advertising revenue through digital displays and collects anonymized user data for valuable insights. Verified emission reductions from this process will be converted into carbon credits, adding further economic value. A portion of these revenues is used for token buybacks and user rewards via ETAN, ensuring real-world utility and continuous demand. By combining blockchain innovation with tangible social impact, Etarn aims to improve public health, promote environmental sustainability, and build a scalable token economy that serves global markets.","links":"https://www.etarn.io/en","market_cap":1034027,"market_cap_rank":3705,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/etarn_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe5e1a0a43f307f390887e2a17399172f3f9a3cab","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xe5e1a0a43f307f390887e2a17399172f3f9a3cab"}},"is_native":false}
