{"name":"Zetacoin","id":"zetacoin","symbol":"zet","description":"Zetacoin is a SHA256 based cryptocurrency, which is the same hashing algorithm used in the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. It features high speed transaction time and difficulty adjustment with a yearly inflationary rate of 1 million coins. It is hoped that the inflationary coins would keep the Zetacoin network strong instead of depending on paying miners via transaction fees.","links":"http://zetacoin.cc/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/zetacoin/logo.png"}
