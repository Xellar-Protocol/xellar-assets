{"name":"Panther Protocol","id":"panther","symbol":"zkp","description":"Due to the immutable and transparent nature of public blockchains, DeFi users are subject to surveillance and economic espionage. DeFi traders risk losing their competitive advantages by having their transaction history observed and strategies reverse engineered and front-run, resulting in a material erosion of alpha and consequently a reduction in performance fees. Without privacy, alpha and individual freedoms erode very quickly. Panther Protocol provides users with transactional privacy when interacting with DeFi, and protects their trading strategies and sovereignty. At the core of Panther's solution are zAssets--interoperable, fully collateralized privacy-enhancing digital assets--that leverage zkSNARK technology. Users are able to mint zero knowledge zAssets by depositing digital assets from any blockchain into Panther vaults and using these zAssets across a full range of DeFi applications. In addition to giving the users the ability to go fully private, there will be different levels of disclosures available. One of them, called Zero Knowledge disclosures, allows users to prove compliance without providing any underlying data, taking advantage of Zero Knowledge Proof technology and trust providers. This is a novel decentralized architecture for privacy and trust and lays the groundwork for institutional players to come into DeFi with a mitigated risk ready to be deployed.","links":"","market_cap":6446203,"market_cap_rank":1678,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/panther/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x909e34d3f6124c324ac83dcca84b74398a6fa173"},"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x9a06db14d639796b25a6cec6a1bf614fd98815ec"}}}
