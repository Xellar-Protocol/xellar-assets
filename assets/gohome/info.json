{"name":"GOHOME","id":"gohome","symbol":"gohome","description":"$GOHOME is a meme-inspired cryptocurrency that emerged from a humorous incident involving the White House website in January 2025. On January 22, 2025, the White House removed its Spanish-language page, replacing it with a \"go home\" button beneath a 404 error message, which was later updated to \"go to home page.\" This event sparked the creation of the $GOHOME meme, symbolizing a lighthearted take on personal boundaries and societal norms. $GOHOME is a community-driven token built on the Solana blockchain, known for its fast transaction speeds and low fees. The project aims to foster a fun, inclusive space where individuals can unite around a common symbol without financial expectations or political agendas. It emphasizes the importance of personal and societal boundaries, celebrating freedom of expression through humor.","links":"https://gohometoken.com/","market_cap":128882229,"market_cap_rank":373,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gohome/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"2Wu1g2ft7qZHfTpfzP3wLdfPeV1is4EwQ3CXBfRYAciD"}}}
