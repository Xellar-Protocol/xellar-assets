{"name":"AmpliFi","id":"amplifi","symbol":"amplifi","description":"AmpliFi is a perpetual yield protocol solidifying its role as the first on-chain annuity. Through the native token's deflationary mechanisms, along with $ETH validator dividends, and a share of protocol trading revenue - AmpliFi strives to bring sustained earnings to all crypto investors. Launched in August 2022 by a team based in US & Europe, AmpliFi is a decentralized application offering a multi-yield architecture that hedges against market conditions. $AMPLIFI holders have the option between several financial products to earn up to 198% native APY, 45% of the $ETH validator pool, and up to 10% of trading fees (all at the same time). The protocol brings intrinsic value to its native token in an era of inflationary emissions. AmpliFi's three pillar products are: 1. Liquidity Mining Program for native yield 2. Creating an Amplifier for native yield and protocol fusing 3. Locking an Amplifier in the fuse pool for ETH dividends and shared protocol revenue AmpliFi has plans for several additional upgrades and products in the coming weeks/months. They'll be harnessing real yield in DeFi and flowing it back to users in a simple, aggregated structure for every class of investor.","links":"https://perpetualyield.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/amplifi/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd23367155b55d67492dfdc0fc7f8bb1df7114fd9"}}}
