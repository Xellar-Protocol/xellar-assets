{"name":"Worthless Two","id":"worthless-two_solana","symbol":"worthless","description":"Worthless 2.0 is a community-driven revival and reimagination of the original Worthless token, which was abandoned by its creators. The community took ownership, rebuilt the token with a fresh contract, and renewed focus on transparency and decentralization. Worthless 2.0 is designed to empower holders through collective action and to foster a fun, fair, and engaged community without any presales or team allocations.","links":"https://x.com/i/communities/1975643239966285933","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/worthless-two/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"9pgfoXFAN6oT9dNswE23oj2kCkCpoLPzHVpTKGAtmoon","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/9pgfoXFAN6oT9dNswE23oj2kCkCpoLPzHVpTKGAtmoon"}},"is_native":false}
