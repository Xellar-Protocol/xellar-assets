O-MEE is a media company that aims to bring the creator economy into Web3, reinventing the accessibility framework of NFTs and return social network data decentralisation to the people. The social network, NFT marketplace, and subscription based system are the foundations of the O-MEE platform. These are the three main drivers of the Web3 creator economy. O-MEE's complete integration and compatibility enables them to facilitate the growth of social and cultural community value by lowering fees, restoring user control over algorithms, and ensuring creators are fairly rewarded. One of the primary distinctions between O-MEE and other NFTmarketplaces is the extremely low fixed rate commission fee on the buyer and seller of goods, as opposed to the high percentage-based commission fee structure provided by other marketplaces. Furthermore, users can create or \"mint\" NFTs in an extremely simple and user-friendly process, allowing anyone with any level of experience to create or list an NFT. Finally, their 'lazy minting' or ‘post creation’ process enables users to create NFTs for their social profiles without having to list them for sale on the open marketplace. This feature fuels platform activity and serves as the primary foundation for content creation. Supporting social features enables users to engage, interact, share, and message, thereby facilitating the ever-increasing need for communication and organic growth while fostering authentic and meaningful relationships. While its core experience is social media architecture, it also includes community building features such as social spaces. Using access NFT technology, you can create exclusive community spaces to provide more gated content to your audience. Supporting features such as pay-per-view are available to view selected posts for a fee.","links":"https://o-mee.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/0-mee/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xbd89b8d708809e7022135313683663911826977e"}}}
