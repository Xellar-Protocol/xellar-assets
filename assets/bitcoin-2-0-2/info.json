{"name":"Bitcoin 2.0","id":"bitcoin-2-0-2","symbol":"btc2","description":"Welcome to the Future of Finance Where utility is optional, vibes are essential, and the number always goes up… eventually. Probably. Hopefully. Who knows. “Built different. Forked better. Vibed harder.” 🔥 THE DNA OF BTC 2.0 Forged in the molten meme-forges of /biz/, BTC 2.0 was born not from whitepapers, but from sheer willpower, chaotic brilliance, and an overconsumption of caffeine. It’s not just another coin — it’s a cultural artifact. A decentralized rebellion. A pixelated middle finger to legacy finance (and possibly to logic itself). 📦 WHAT YOU ACTUALLY GET • Zero Utility (Ironically) It does nothing. And that’s the point. • Infinite Potential Anything can happen. Literally anything. That’s the beauty (and the risk). • 100% Community-Powered No VCs, no roadmaps, no clue. Just vibes and a crowd that believes harder than anyone else. • Upgradable Branding If it pumps: “Web3 Bitcoin.” If not: Back to dank memes and hopium.","links":"https://btc2.money/","market_cap":140901,"market_cap_rank":6140,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bitcoin-2-0-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xbc2ecbe2195114b82f03680ed4270fa7008f3be0","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xbc2ecbe2195114b82f03680ed4270fa7008f3be0"}}}
