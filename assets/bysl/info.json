{"name":"bYSL","id":"bysl","symbol":"bysl","description":"bYSL is a governance token in the YSL.IO ecosystem, designed to empower its holders with the ability to influence the protocol's direction through voting on proposals. With a fixed and inelastic supply, bYSL ensures that holders' rights remain undiluted as the ecosystem expands. One of the key features of bYSL is the token tax applied to every transfer or sale. A 2.5% tax is levied on each transaction, with the proceeds sent directly to bYSL AceVault participants. This mechanism allows holders to passively grow their bYSL balance while earning Virtue-Rewards every 8 hours. As a bYSL holder, you not only benefit from the AceVault rewards but also actively participate in the decision-making process within the ecosystem. This token offers an opportunity for users to contribute their ideas and help shape the future of the protocol, fostering a community-driven approach to development and growth.","links":"https://ysl.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bysl/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc34326533e8606e742c7e3775f59994a3ed9fb2f"}}}
