{"name":"FREGO","id":"frego_solana","symbol":"frego","description":"FREGO is building FregOS, the first complete trust & safety platform for AI agents in web3. Agents that integrate with FregOS can safely interact with commerce systems like x402, DeFi protocols, and smart contracts. Developers can integrate in minutes using open-source Python and JS/TS SDKs. FregOS is in active development and provides a best-in-class feature set, even compared to web2 equivalents. Features include end-to-end observability, behavioral and payment guardrails, compliance automation for standards like ISO 42001 and the EU AI Act, a decentralized inference gateway, and more—all running on SOC 2 compliant infrastructure to ensure security and privacy. FregOS is natively integrated with the FREGO x402 trust platform, designed to help sellers build trust with customers at scale.","links":"https://www.frego.ai/","market_cap":85803,"market_cap_rank":7257,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/frego_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"F9GqoJRPzQnGzvP7cQzLHB7C22DToHQYWfsPvhKwqrpC","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/F9GqoJRPzQnGzvP7cQzLHB7C22DToHQYWfsPvhKwqrpC"}},"is_native":false}
