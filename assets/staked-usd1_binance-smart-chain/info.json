{"name":"staked USD1+","id":"staked-usd1_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"susd1+","description":"USD1+ is a synthetic U.S. dollar stablecoin developed by Lorenzo Labs, backed by WLFI USD1. It is the first stablecoin to combine Real-World Asset (RWA) yields with delta-neutral strategy yields, aiming to deliver superior returns. USD1+ maintains a 1:1 peg with traditional stablecoins and is designed as a rebasing token, with all positions ultimately settled into USD1. sUSD1+ is the staked version of USD1+, accruing yield over time through the same underlying mechanisms. Unlike USD1+, sUSD1+ is a value-accruing token, where the token price increases to reflect earned yield. USD1+ and sUSD1+ are fully interchangeable, allowing users to stake and unstake seamlessly based on their preferences.","links":"https://app.lorenzo-protocol.xyz/otf/vault","market_cap":83700248,"market_cap_rank":469,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/staked-usd1_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x4f2760b32720f013e900dc92f65480137391199b","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x4f2760b32720f013e900dc92f65480137391199b"}},"is_native":false}
