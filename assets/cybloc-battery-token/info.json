{"name":"CyBall CyBloc Battery","id":"cybloc-battery-token","symbol":"cbt","description":"CyBall is a futuristic football-themed (US: soccer), NFT-based game where users can collect and form a team of CyBlocs and face off against other teams online, or trade and mentor new CyBlocs within the CyBall's ecosystem. Initially, the game will launch on BNB Chain with immediate plans to launch on Solana as soon as it is ready to create a multi-chain gaming environment. The CyBall game engine combines different elements of strategy, simulation and chance into the form of an exciting and competitive turn-based football card game, where players compete to see who can score the most goals. Players train up their CyBlocs to compete in various game modes with varying levels of rewards. Existing CyBlocs can also mentor young CyBlocs, creating the next generation of unique NFTs. In future expansions, we aim to give players more ways to spend accrued rewards, both in CyBall and in the wider CyBloc universe. CyBall's metaverse is welcoming and catered to all demographics, whilst also serving as the bridge between players and blockchain technology through the game's all encompassing CyBloc universe. CyBall will feature a Play-to-Earn mechanism, which has been made viable by blockchain economics. In a world where games, social media, and many platforms compete for users' limited attention span, Play-to-Earn element enables users to be rewarded simply by playing the game. This revolutionary model has proven to be a major income source not only for active and casual players alike, but also for NFT collectors who are looking to loan out their assets!","links":"https://cyball.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cybloc-battery-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x7c73967dc8c804ea028247f5a953052f0cd5fd58"}}}
