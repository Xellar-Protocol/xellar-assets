{"name":"Messiah","id":"messiah","symbol":"msia","description":"The complexity and resource-intensive nature of deploying and managing web3 infrastructure present significant barriers to entry for many users; from a financial and technical perspective. Messiah aims to address these challenges by offering user-friendly, one-click deployment tools and automated management services for nodes, smart contracts, decentralised application and crypto mining operations. In simplifying these processes, we make the relevant infrastructure accessible to a broader audience, promoting widespread adoption of web3. Messiah’s Mission Current centralized systems face significant challenges, necessitating a reassessment of traditional approaches. Once the backbone of the digital revolution, centralized infrastructure now exposes vulnerabilities, creating single points of failure that increase the risks of cyberattacks and downtime. These vulnerabilities compromise internet services and data integrity. As the digital ecosystem grows more complex, the fragility of centralized systems becomes increasingly apparent. Messiah recognizes the urgent need for robust security measures to protect against unauthorized access and security breaches.","links":"https://www.messiah.network/","market_cap":2407530,"market_cap_rank":3111,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/messiah/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x4b6d60361faebf0cfe06c442cd0eb151bc261a7a","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x4b6d60361faebf0cfe06c442cd0eb151bc261a7a"}}}
