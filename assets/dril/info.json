{"name":"DRIL","id":"dril","symbol":"dril","description":"Dril combines the community-driven dynamics of platforms like Reddit and 4chan with tokenized incentives. 4chan is known for the anonymity and privacy it offers its users, while Reddit runs on a karma-based approach that appreciates users who contribute value to its community. Dril takes the best of both into DeFi—building a platform that provides the privacy degens need and rewarding their contributions with crypto, based on a point-based reward system.","links":"https://dril.fun","market_cap":8539.24,"market_cap_rank":11061,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dril/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"BX58em48xk2sBr8BCVp7NDQPMdoK8Ag71XfgyiWypump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/BX58em48xk2sBr8BCVp7NDQPMdoK8Ag71XfgyiWypump"}}}
