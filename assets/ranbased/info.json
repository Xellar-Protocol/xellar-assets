{"name":"RANBASED","id":"ranbased","symbol":"ranb","description":"The reference token/commodity, is chosen by the Ranbased community. This function is jokingly referred to as Ran Wars. Users can send a transaction to change the pair at random from the options in the pool if they want to change things up. Why change the Rebase Pair, you ask? There are a few reasons. One is to achieve a positive rebase - if the current pair's price action isn't leading to a positive rebase, you can wish to change to a new pair that has a greater probability of triggering a positive rebase. You can choose the tempo because RANB is your token.","links":"https://www.ranbased.com/index.html","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ranbased/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xeaba97bf5668f5022f66942c84a03dd5c86045d3"}}}
