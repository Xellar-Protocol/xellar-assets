{"name":"Rose","id":"rose-2_solana","symbol":"rose","description":"The Dead Rose Emoji, also known as the Wilted Flower Emoji, refers to the 🥀 emoji that depicts a wilted rose. It's used online to represent being damaged or heartbroken, earnestly shared by emo internet users. Ironic use predominantly surfaced in early 2025, mostly in reaction to the use of the broken heart or heartbreak emoji (💔) in memes like Dih To Yo Crack / Slide That Shi In Gng 💔 and late rapper XXXTentacion saying, What's a Father? The overuse of the heartbreak emoji led to TikTokers on so-called JuggTok switching to the dead rose emoji because the heartbreak one had become too mainstream. The dead rose emoji then amassed use in slang overload posts similar to ICL TS PMO and incorporated into emojipastas and copypastas like Nah She Got You Blushing Twin.","links":"https://pump.fun/coin/6ZMu4PRVpNMxVHdzMDcGLQf4Qv9x73YHpsHrK6mepump","market_cap":7922.12,"market_cap_rank":11615,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/rose-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"6ZMu4PRVpNMxVHdzMDcGLQf4Qv9x73YHpsHrK6mepump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/6ZMu4PRVpNMxVHdzMDcGLQf4Qv9x73YHpsHrK6mepump"}},"is_native":false}
