{"name":"MasterBOT","id":"masterbot_solana","symbol":"$bot","description":"\"MasterBOT\" is a Web3 platform where a global community collaborates to train the sophisticated AI that will power the next generation of real-world robots. The project showcases the immense speed and efficiency of virtual simulation in solving the biggest bottleneck in robotics: AI training. The MVP Mechanism: The core of our launch product is a fully autonomous Unity simulation. A \"Game Master\" algorithm procedurally generates a unique, complex obstacle course each day. Three distinct AI \"Training Strategies\" are deployed in parallel to learn and solve the challenge, generating valuable data on AI learning. Our goal is to demonstrate a new paradigm for developing the brains of the billions of robots that will define the next economic boom.","links":"https://masterbot.app","market_cap":781527,"market_cap_rank":4024,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/masterbot_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"63bpnCja1pGB2HSazkS8FAPAUkYgcXoDwYHfvZZveBot","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/63bpnCja1pGB2HSazkS8FAPAUkYgcXoDwYHfvZZveBot"}},"is_native":false}
