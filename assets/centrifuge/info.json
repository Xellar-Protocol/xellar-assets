{"name":"Centrifuge [OLD]","id":"centrifuge","symbol":"cfg","description":"The centrifuge token model powers centrifuge, providing the framework needed to run the platform without reliance on a single point of failure, including the centrifuge team or Company, and to accelerate its utility. To accomplish this, centrifuge leverages the cryptoeconomic primitives of a native token called the centrifuge token (cfg), a nominated-proof-of-stake consensus algorithm that employs centrifuge to stake value, rewards for centrifuge adoption, and an on-chain governance mechanism that empowers centrifuge holders to guide the development of centrifuge.","links":"https://centrifuge.io/","market_cap":113724446,"market_cap_rank":401,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/centrifuge/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
