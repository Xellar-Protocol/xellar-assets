{"name":"Kyros Restaked JTO","id":"kyros-restaked-jto","symbol":"kyjto","description":"kyJTO is the Kyros Vault (Re)staking Token (VRT), representing a liquid restaking token tied to JTO. With kyJTO, users gain exposure to JTO while also earning additional restaking rewards from securing TipRouter NCN. Similar to how kySOL works, kyJTO rewards are automatically compounded into kyJTO. This means that over time, the value of kyJTO increases relative to JTO as it accrues more rewards. Additionally, kyJTO is liquid and can be used within DeFi applications to maximize capital efficiency through various strategies.","links":"https://app.kyros.fi","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kyros-restaked-jto/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"kyJtowDDACsJDm2jr3VZdpCA6pZcKAaNftQwrJ8KBQP","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/kyJtowDDACsJDm2jr3VZdpCA6pZcKAaNftQwrJ8KBQP"}}}
