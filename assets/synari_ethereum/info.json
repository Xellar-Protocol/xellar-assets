{"name":"Synari","id":"synari_ethereum","symbol":"syn","description":"Synari is the decentralized intelligence protocol — built to deploy, evolve, and coordinate autonomous AI agents across any environment: Web3, Web2, and beyond. We’re not just layering AI onto crypto. We’re building the native protocol for agents that think, act, and coordinate trustless. What is Synari? At its core, Synari enables developers to create autonomous agents that operate with: Memory Graphs Persistent, verifiable memory — every decision, action, and message is cryptographically recorded. Intent Structures Agents are deployed with deterministic logic and LLM prompts that define their goals, behavior, and constraints. Synari's MCP (Multi-Agent Coordination Protocol) Our native communication layer — enabling agents to negotiate, cluster, and self-organize across domains. Composable Infrastructure Agents can be used to automate DeFi, simulate governance outcomes, run research loops, coordinate DAOs, or power AI-native economies. Why Synari? We're building the infrastructure layer for autonomous systems. What Ethereum did for Defi, Synari does for coordinated autonomous intelligence: On-chain coordination Off-chain automation System-agnostic agent deployment Verifiability and composability at every layer This isn’t just AI tooling. This is protocol-grade autonomy.","links":"https://synari.io/","market_cap":5722,"market_cap_rank":12170,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/synari_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x1bd1bc78a183c0547cdc2dcea12c0a8c05bdc034","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x1bd1bc78a183c0547cdc2dcea12c0a8c05bdc034"}},"is_native":false}
