Anybody can participate in Compound governance by receiving delegation, without needing to own COMP. Anybody with 1% of COMP delegated to their address can propose a governance action; these are simple or complex sets of actions, such as adding support for a new asset, changing an asset’s collateral factor, changing a market’s interest rate model, or changing any other parameter or variable of the protocol that the current administrator can modify.","links":"https://compound.finance/governance/comp","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/compound-governance-token/logo.png"}
