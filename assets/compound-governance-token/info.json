{"name":"Compound","id":"compound-governance-token","symbol":"comp","description":"The Compound Governance Token is a governance token on the Compound Finance lending protocol, COMP allows the owner to delegate voting rights to the address of their choice; the owner’s wallet, another user, an application, or a DeFi expert. Anybody can participate in Compound governance by receiving delegation, without needing to own COMP. Anybody with 1% of COMP delegated to their address can propose a governance action; these are simple or complex sets of actions, such as adding support for a new asset, changing an asset’s collateral factor, changing a market’s interest rate model, or changing any other parameter or variable of the protocol that the current administrator can modify.","links":"https://compound.finance/governance/comp","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/compound-governance-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc00e94cb662c3520282e6f5717214004a7f26888"},"near-protocol":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"c00e94cb662c3520282e6f5717214004a7f26888.factory.bridge.near"},"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x52ce071bd9b1c4b00a0b92d298c512478cad67e8"},"avalanche":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc3048e19e76cb9a3aa9d77d8c03c29fc906e2437"},"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8505b9d2254a7ae468c0e9dd10ccea3a837aef5c"},"harmony-shard-0":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x32137b9275ea35162812883582623cd6f6950958"},"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x354a6da3fcde098f8389cad84b0182725c6c91de"},"sora":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x00dbd45af9f2ea406746f9025110297469e9d29efc60df8d88efb9b0179d6c2c"},"energi":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x66bc411714e16b6f0c68be12bd9c666cc4576063"}}}
