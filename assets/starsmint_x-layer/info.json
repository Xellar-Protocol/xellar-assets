{"name":"StarsMint","id":"starsmint_x-layer","symbol":"stars","description":"StarsMint is a fair token minting platform built on X Layer. The project aims to solve long-standing problems in token launches such as unfair insider allocations, rug-pull risks, and price manipulation. Through its protocol, all users mint tokens at the same fixed price, while 90% of the raised funds are automatically injected and locked into a V3 liquidity pool. This design ensures that tokens can always be exited at around 90% of the mint price, providing a transparent and secure mechanism for both creators and participants. StarsMint positions itself as a launch infrastructure for meme tokens, community-driven assets, and experimental projects that want to grow within a safe and fair environment.","links":"https://www.starsmint.xyz","market_cap":307097,"market_cap_rank":5283,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/starsmint/logo.png","detail_platform":{"x-layer":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0af1b7d7a063b339afe7a64c8e7fd71693e4fe45","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/x-layer/tokens/0x0af1b7d7a063b339afe7a64c8e7fd71693e4fe45"}},"is_native":false}
