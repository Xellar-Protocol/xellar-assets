{"name":"City of Dream","id":"city-of-dream","symbol":"cod","description":"As a Metaverse that perfectly integrates SocialFi and GameFi, City Of Dream strives to realize the Nasdaq of the meta-universe world. This platform embraces the web3.0 concept and effectively provides every individual with an opportunity to show their self-value and build their Self-brand. City of Dream will launch five sections, including MarkBoss, Glory Badge, Global Lottery Pool, Global Broadcasting, and Fictitious Life. Each section of COD is closely interconnected and finally forms a closed loop that will redefine human resources in the blockchain industry. In addition, City of Dream expects to build a private network for the public, in which each individual will have his or her own cryptographic identity, which will reveal the user's experience, skills, and all behaviors that take place in the ecosystem of City of Dream, thus helping them tokenize and financialize their self-value.","links":"https://cod.social/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/city-of-dream/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x73eb6947d72ed1979e6a935f516212a7f593bc44"}}}
