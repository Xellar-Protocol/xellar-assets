{"name":"Hifi Finance","id":"hifi-finance","symbol":"hifi","description":"Hifi Finance is a lending protocol that addresses the need for fixed-rate lending and borrowing in decentralized finance. It allows anyone to access instant liquidity against collateral assets approved by Hifi Governance, by tokenizing on-chain debt. Hifi Governance is a community-organized process that manages the various aspects of the Hifi Lending Protocol. Hifi proposes a novel liquidation architecture that drives resources back to ecosystem participants and balances incentives between borrowers, lenders, and guarantors. The system works by borrowers depositing collateral and minting tokens, which represent a debt obligation that settles on a specific future date. The Hifi Token (HIFI) is utilized to vote on governance proposals, unlock discounts, achieve greater capital efficiency, increase protocol rewards, and access additional leverage.","links":"https://hifi.finance/","market_cap":56285234,"market_cap_rank":547,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/hifi-finance/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x4b9278b94a1112cad404048903b8d343a810b07e"}}}
