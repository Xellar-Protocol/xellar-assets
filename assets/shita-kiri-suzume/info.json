This story is based around the moral lessons of greed, friendship, and jealousy. Suzume is an ERC-20 token based on the Ethereum blockchain and launched on August 3rd, 2022. Suzume is currently publicly available for trade. The intention of Suzume is to be a decentralized community-powered project and is centered around the meme token sphere of cryptocurrency pioneered by the likes of Doge and Shiba for mass adoption. To achieve a true decentralized project, there is no head of operations, entity or person that has sole custody of Suzume. The liquidity for Suzume has been burned and there is no tax function.","links":"https://www.shitakirisuzume.com","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/shita-kiri-suzume/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0b452278223d3954f4ac050949d7998e373e7e43","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x0b452278223d3954f4ac050949d7998e373e7e43"}}}
