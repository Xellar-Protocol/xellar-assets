{"name":"Reply","id":"reply_base","symbol":"reply","description":"Reply is a social finance (SocialFi) primitive built as a mini-app on the Farcaster protocol. Its primary purpose is to solve the problem of signal versus noise in direct messaging on open social networks. The application introduces an onchain, peer-to-peer economic layer to communication, allowing users to send prioritized, paid messages to high-demand individuals such as builders, creators, and thought leaders. This creates a high-signal inbox for receivers and a guaranteed way for senders to have their important messages seen.","links":"https://farcaster.xyz/miniapps/ZuqxLQnWC2Nh/reply","market_cap":25924,"market_cap_rank":9277,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/reply/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x638a57267633b8bd9756de2e3a1e2de658b52b07","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x638a57267633b8bd9756de2e3a1e2de658b52b07"}},"is_native":false}
