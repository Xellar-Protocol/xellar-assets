{"name":"Cardano Maxi","id":"cardano-maxi","symbol":"maxi","description":"Cardano MAXI is a community-led meme token built on the Cardano blockchain, reborn from the ashes of a failed project. After the original dev rugged the previous version, a committed community member relaunched the token under a new contract, new policy ID, and clean tokenomics—cutting all ties to the past. With a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens and fair distribution, MAXI symbolizes conviction, patience, and true belief in Cardano’s long-term mission. It’s more than just a meme—it’s a movement. The MAXI community is made of die-hard Cardano believers who hold through bear markets, build during quiet times, and meme because it matters. The project embraces transparency, decentralized governance, and long-term value through features like locked liquidity, staking, on-chain voting, and a treasury system managed by the holders. MAXI represents the “maximalist” spirit: loyal to Cardano, driven by community, and fueled by purpose. It partners with meme-forward ecosystems like Snek.fun and aims to be the go-to symbol of Cardano pride. No influencers. No VC games. Just grassroots strength and a ticker that refuses to die. MAXI is not just a coin—it’s a signal that Cardano’s culture is alive, powerful, and built to last.","links":"https://maxicardano.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cardano-maxi/logo.png","detail_platform":{"cardano":{"decimal_place":0,"contract_address":"017afeedd107263a72ec6f9d1441e7fc42278b4739df1598dea416e2"}}}
