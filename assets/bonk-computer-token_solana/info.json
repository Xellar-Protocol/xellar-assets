{"name":"Bonk Computer Token","id":"bonk-computer-token_solana","symbol":"bct","description":"Bonk Computer is a browser-native community application built on Solana that provides access to secure, token-gated virtual machines. Using $BCT, and in some cases $BONK or $SOL, users can launch decentralized compute environments without creating accounts, access is granted through wallet holdings. The platform includes persistent storage, shared VM sessions, and real-time collaboration tools. Designed to operate without centralized infrastructure, Bonk Computer is built and maintained by its own community. The platform continues to expand through community development and open-source contributions.","links":"https://www.bonk.computer/","market_cap":19765.39,"market_cap_rank":9808,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bonk-computer-token_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"D3CVUkqyXZKgVBdRD7XfuRxQXFKJ86474XyFZrqAbonk","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/D3CVUkqyXZKgVBdRD7XfuRxQXFKJ86474XyFZrqAbonk"}},"is_native":false}
