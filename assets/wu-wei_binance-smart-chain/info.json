{"name":"無為 (Wu Wei)","id":"wu-wei_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"wuwei","description":"無為($WUWEI) is a community-driven memecoin operating on the BSC chain, established with principles of maximal transparency and security. This token was deployed as a 100% Fair Launch, no presale, no team allocation, and all tokens were immediately made fully circulating upon launch. Key security and integrity features include: 1. Full Renunciation of Contract Ownership: The contract ownership has been permanently renounced, preventing any future modification to the contract, minting of new tokens, or adjustment of transaction taxes. 2. Permanent Liquidity Lock: The initial liquidity pool (LP) tokens were permanently Burned, ensuring perpetual tradability. 3. Zero Taxes: Transactions are governed by a 0% buy and 0% sell tax structure, promoting free and high-volume trading. The project is now entirely driven by community, focusing on organic social growth and brand building based on the WuWei(or Doing Nothing) narrative. The primary function of $WUWEI is purely for entertainment and social currency.","links":"https://wuwei.vercel.app/","market_cap":28105,"market_cap_rank":9143,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wu-wei_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x9462bb84993c606a9d70758d655f30f96d304444","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x9462bb84993c606a9d70758d655f30f96d304444"}},"is_native":false}
