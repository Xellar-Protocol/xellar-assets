{"name":"Metropolis","id":"metropolis","symbol":"metro","description":"Metropolis is a DLMM Decentralized Exchange (DEX) bringing Liquidity Book to Sonic. Trade with zero slippage and earn real yield with unlimited control as a DeFi Market Maker. The Liquidity Book feature allows to concentrate liquidity into single bins, which leads to more efficient and flexible liquidity provisioning and seamless trading experiences with zero slippage and low fees. To allow concentrated liquidity, the price curve is discretized into bins, which is similar to the tick concept in Uniswap V3. The main difference however, is that LB uses the constant sum price formula instead of the constant product formula.","links":"https://metropolis.exchange/","market_cap":1160541,"market_cap_rank":3488,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/metropolis/logo.png","detail_platform":{"sonic":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x71e99522ead5e21cf57f1f542dc4ad2e841f7321"}}}
