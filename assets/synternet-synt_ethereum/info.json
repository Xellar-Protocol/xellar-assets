{"name":"Synternet","id":"synternet-synt_ethereum","symbol":"synt","description":"Synternet is the Open Agent Marketplace where real-time data fuels intelligent, autonomous AI. Unlike traditional systems that depend on slow, outdated web scraping or centralized APIs, Synternet delivers verified, real-time blockchain data directly to onchain Agents. These Agents continuously monitor networks for critical signals—such as depegs, exploits, and fund movements across chains—and respond autonomously. By removing intermediaries and trust bottlenecks, Synternet unlocks faster, more reliable decision-making in decentralized finance (DeFi), global finance, and a new generation of AI-powered protocols and applications. It’s the infrastructure layer enabling machines to reason, react, and trade at the speed of the networks they live on.","links":"https://www.synternet.com/","market_cap":3705558,"market_cap_rank":2340,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/synternet-synt_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xda987c655ebc38c801db64a8608bc1aa56cd9a31","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xda987c655ebc38c801db64a8608bc1aa56cd9a31"}},"is_native":false}
