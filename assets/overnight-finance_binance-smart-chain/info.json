{"name":"Overnight Finance","id":"overnight-finance_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"ovn","description":"At the core of Overnight is the concept of stablecoin-based DeFi. The platform introduces stablecoins like USD+, DAI+, and USDT+ that are designed to maintain a stable value relative to their underlying assets. These stablecoins serve as foundational building blocks for users to access various opportunities within the DeFi landscape. Overnight.fi is a protocol focusing on asset management, with a specialization in neutral-risk strategies. At the heart of its product line is USD+, which is a yield-driven stablecoin, fully backed by collateral. This collateral for USD+ is rooted in DeFi strategies that generate returns. These strategies encompass lending to platforms like Aave, and include both stablecoin-to-stablecoin and neutral-risk strategies. The goal of issuing OVN is twofold: Promote and popularize USD+, which is achieved with using OVN for bribes; Establish a robust & decentralized risk monitoring and management processes at the protocol level. OVN token will provide standard voting rights which will be key to realizing the vision of decentralized risk-management. OVN token should help align community incentives with this goal: to reward for supporting conservative risk decisions, and for vetoing aggressive ones.","links":"https://overnight.fi","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/overnight-finance_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x259b30c916e440fb79747cd559207ffdabbae057","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x259b30c916e440fb79747cd559207ffdabbae057"}},"is_native":false}
