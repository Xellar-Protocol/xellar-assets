{"name":"NAGA","id":"naga","symbol":"ngc","description":"NAGA is a public listed, EU-regulated German Fintech company with trading-platforms for financial markets and virtual goods, a market cap of more than 200m Euros, millions in revenues and billions in trading volume every month. Investments and trading are ruled and governed by greedy banks and corporates that control access, operate non-transparent and always take a cut of your money. At NAGA we are about to change that. By introducing the NAGA COIN, we are on a mission to revolutionize the outdated banking sector. The financial markets are about to change, and we embrace that.","links":"https://nagax.com/","market_cap":1734224,"market_cap_rank":2242,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/naga/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x72dd4b6bd852a3aa172be4d6c5a6dbec588cf131"}}}
