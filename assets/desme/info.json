{"name":"DeSME","id":"desme","symbol":"desme","description":"DeSME introduces an innovative hybrid investment model combining the cryptocurrency and MSME sectors. It aims to offer cryptocurrency investors both stability and growth opportunities. The project's token facilitates a three-pronged strategy for returning profits to token holders. 2% of transaction taxes fund investments in offline MSME businesses. These investments aim to stabilize returns by tapping into the proven resilience of the MSME industry. Profits generated from the MSME portfolio are redistributed to token holders. Additionally, 2% of taxes support project operations while 1% is directly rewarded to community members. DeSME also develops its own crypto-based utilities, such as tools for decentralized finance, that generate revenue through use of the token. Revenue from both MSME investments and crypto products is shared with holders. DeSME provides a more reliable revenue stream compared to typical crypto market volatility. Its hybrid model offers exposure to both traditional businesses and blockchain applications. Adopting a transparent and community-driven governance system, the project fosters sustainable economic growth. It aims to empower small enterprises worldwide while collaborating with cryptocurrency investors through open participation and decision making. DeSME's balanced three-pronged approach strives to deliver stability and opportunities to its community in a clear and straightforward manner.","links":"https://www.desme.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/desme/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":5,"contract_address":"0x23dc3f6859e122b25b2cd5f3cf2335310b0f2b77"}}}
