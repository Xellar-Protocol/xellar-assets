{"name":"AXIS","id":"axis-token","symbol":"axis","description":"The AXIS Utility token serves as an API access key for the blockchain ecosystem. It also facilitates transactions and access to data, and is used as a vehicle to run applications. For example, if a carrier wants to check on a proof of pickup he needs to access the database/blockchain, and will submit fractions of an AXIS Token to do so. Similarly, a Shipper would submit fractions of a token to validate documents and deliveries.","links":"https://axistoken.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/axis-token/logo.png"}
