{"name":"SKOR AI","id":"skor-ai","symbol":"skorai","description":"SKOR AI is an award-winning project at the forefront of gaming innovation, recognized as “Best AI for Gaming 2025” by Entrepreneur Magazine. After over two years of dedicated development, the platform is live with a working product currently in beta. SKOR AI is building the world’s first hub of intelligent gaming agents—virtual co-pilots designed to help gamers save time, optimize performance, earn rewards, and master their favorite games. In today’s hypercompetitive gaming world, players face numerous challenges: wasted time searching for tournaments and earning opportunities, lack of personalized gameplay feedback, and no clear path to skill growth. Discovery across games and platforms is fragmented, and engagement feels disconnected. SKOR AI solves these problems with an intelligent and scalable solution—AI agents built specifically for gamers. The first of these agents, Agent Precision, is already live in beta. Designed for Counter-Strike 2, it acts as a personalized real-time coach that offers live callouts, strategic insights, and post-match analytics to help players level up. From crosshair placement to clutch scenarios, it empowers players to play smarter, not harder. Unlike other AI projects, SKOR AI is not a generic chatbot. Its agents are trained on over 10,000 hours of real gameplay data using custom foundational models and adaptive learning techniques. This allows the AI to deliver highly relevant, context-aware insights tailored to each player’s in-game behavior. The platform is built to scale across genres, games, and communities—catering to the needs of over 3.32 billion gamers globally. SKOR AI follows a SaaS-driven model with subscription plans designed for both Web2 and Web3 gamers, offering flexibility and accessibility. Future agents will unlock even deeper layers of performance optimization and community engagement. Backed by a team with more than 50 years of collective experience in gaming and esports, SKOR AI is uniquely positioned to lead the AI gaming revolution. The team has worked with some of the most successful gaming companies in the world, scaling products and communities across millions of users. SKOR AI is not just building tools—it’s building infrastructure to redefine how gamers train, compete, and thrive in the digital arena.","links":"https://skoragents.ai/","market_cap":152467773,"market_cap_rank":325,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/skor-ai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"8CLGcTogo6FoYkEQQBm3Vm2PVckYCiCm3XXhdsr4skoR"}}}
