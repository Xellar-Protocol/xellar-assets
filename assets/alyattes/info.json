{"name":"Alyattes","id":"alyattes","symbol":"alya","description":"The Alyattes project is a unified project consisting of 6 different major platforms. Therefore, it would not be logical to evaluate ALYATTES as a single project. All of these major platforms constitute the Alyattes project in a structural manner that supports one another. In general terms, these platforms are aiming to spread to the average user group where everyone can easily perform transactions, evaluate investment opportunities in crypto market and connect blockchain technologies, games, social media, entertainment applications in our daily life. ALYATTES project is built on its sub-platforms. The most important sub-platform is the social responsibility project which is automatically going to be financed with the transfer fees that will be deducted from the users.","links":"https://www.alyattes.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/alyattes/logo.png"}
