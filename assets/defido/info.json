{"name":"DeFido","id":"defido","symbol":"defido","description":"What is DeFido? DeFido was built on the Binance Smart Chain as a meme cryptocurrency. More specifically, it is a hyper-deflationary sub coin with a smart sharing system built into the ecosystem, so each investor receives more DeFido in their wallet just for holding. There is a redistribution transfer for every buy/sell, 8% commission fee is charged and distributed, 4% to holders and the other 4% is added to the marketing wallet for project development.","links":"https://defidotoken.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/defido/logo.png"}
