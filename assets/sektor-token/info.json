{"name":"Sektor Token","id":"sektor-token","symbol":"sektor","description":"SEKTOR is the project token of the Sektor crypto mentoring group. This is an essential part of the range of services and also serves to visualize the individual project packages. We make our possibilities and experience available as a real product and interweave it directly with our portfolio, thereby enabling all investors and holders to participate in the overall success of the project. The fusion through implementation, application and benefit is a basic economic factor for project success. Especially through the application of the mentoring process, we can positively influence the course of projects and thus ensure an impact in the development process. Our mission is to establish more value-added projects and thus generate a sustainable impact on the development of blockchain adoption.","links":"https://www.crypto-sektor.com/index.php/sektor-token","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/sektor-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x7d59368eb0c23d299ebe12ebca58eae59f9fe028"}}}
