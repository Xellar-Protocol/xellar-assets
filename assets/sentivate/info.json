{"name":"Sentivate","id":"sentivate","symbol":"sntvt","description":"Sentivate is a revolutionary advancement, not evolutionary, in Internet architecture. Sentivate has a hybrid topology consisting of interconnected centralized & decentralized systems. The network is designed to go beyond the capabilities that any solely centralized or decentralized network could offer. Sentivate has the ability to operate in a decentralized or centralized topology, if the need ever arose, giving it a unique dynamic topology. With Sentivate's data transport protocol, UDSP, all the issues associated with TCP will be a relic of the past. Sentivate is designed to be a realistic and viable replacement for the increasingly slugish Web we have today.","links":"https://sentivate.com","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/sentivate/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x7865af71cf0b288b4e7f654f4f7851eb46a2b7f8"}}}
