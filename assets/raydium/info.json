{"name":"Raydium","id":"raydium","symbol":"ray","description":"Raydium is an automated market maker (AMM) and liquidity provider built on the Solana blockchain for the Serum decentralized exchange (DEX). Raydium has a first-mover advantage as an AMM within Serum and will be an integral part of bringing new and existing projects and protocols into the ecosystem. The protocol will act as a bridge for projects looking to expand to Solana and Serum, and in the process Raydium and the RAY token will become a foundation for enabling further development with partners, its own platform, and the ecosystem as a whole. Unlike any other AMMs, Raydium provides on-chain liquidity to a central limit orderbook, meaning that Raydium LPs get access to the entire orderflow and liquidity of Serum. Long term, Raydium aims to capture and maintain a leadership position among AMMs and liquidity providers on Serum, while leveraging the power of Solana to drive the evolution of decentralized finance (DeFi) and emerge as a leading protocol in the space alongside our partners and the community.\"","links":"https://raydium.io/","market_cap":1519871420,"market_cap_rank":88,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/raydium/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"4k3Dyjzvzp8eMZWUXbBCjEvwSkkk59S5iCNLY3QrkX6R"}}}
