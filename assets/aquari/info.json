{"name":"Aquari","id":"aquari","symbol":"aquari","description":"Aquari is a gamified gig-economy consumer app democratizing the value captured by impact labor traditionally monopolized by NGOs & Non-Profits. The current model for paying non-profit workers & contributors is unfairly distributed and insufficiently transparent. Aquari is inspired by giving real financial empowerment and leverage to ground-zero non-profit environmental workers through the use of utility, proof-of-physical-work NFTs. The Aquari community envisions a future in which the major environmental non-profits today evolve into publicly traded companies on-chain driven by market forces instead of philanthropy. A world where those who provide capital or human capital to deliver impact can finally capture the financial value they helped to create. A true merging of the existing non-profit sector with the rest of the market economy so that the proper incentives may finally align.","links":"https://www.aquari.org","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/aquari/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x6500197a2488610aca288fd8e2dfe88ec99e596c"}}}
