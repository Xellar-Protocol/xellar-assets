{"name":"SMARDEX WRAPPED USDN","id":"smardex-wrapped-usdn","symbol":"wusdn","description":"wUSDN, or wrapped USDN, is an ERC-20 token that serves as a value-accruing wrapper for USDN within the SmarDex ecosystem. Unlike USDN, which employs a rebase mechanism to distribute yields by adjusting token balances, wUSDN maintains a constant token balance while its value appreciates over time. Internally, wUSDN represents a user’s share of the total USDN supply, allowing holders to benefit from USDN’s yield generation without experiencing balance fluctuations.","links":"https://smardex.io/usdn","market_cap":1488312,"market_cap_rank":3666,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/smardex-wrapped-usdn/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x99999999999999cc837c997b882957dafdcb1af9","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x99999999999999cc837c997b882957dafdcb1af9"}}}
