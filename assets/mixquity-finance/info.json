{"name":"Mixquity Finance","id":"mixquity-finance","symbol":"mixq","description":"- Rebase is a fundamental feature of MixQuity, aiming to dynamically adjust the total supply of MIXQ tokens at regular intervals. This mechanism ensures that the number of tokens held by users and investors increases over time, facilitated by a transparent and precise calculation formula. - Daily Profit for Token Holders One of the core features of MixQuity is the profit distribution (from Treasury) to token holders in the form of LP rewards. Holding $MIXQ tokens means holding a stake in the project itself. To achieve a state of 100% decentralization, profit sharing is directly proportional to the percentage of tokens a user holds compared to the liquidity pool. Simply put, the more $MIXQ tokens a user holds, the larger their share of profits. - Consistent Reward Distribution MixQuity ensures fairness and consistency by maintaining a fixed 3% reward for MIXQ token holders, regardless of fluctuations in the transaction tax rate. Even as the tax rate decreases from 6% to 4% after 20 days, $MIXQ holders will continue to receive their 3% share of profits. - Long-Term Sustainability As MixQuity progresses and matures, reaching a stable stage of development, our vision includes allocating only 1% of the collected taxes to the development of the MixQuity ecosystem. This strategic allocation of tax revenue demonstrates our dedication to sustainability and financial responsibility. By setting aside a portion of the tax revenue for ecosystem development, we ensure that MixQuity can adapt and thrive in the ever-evolving DeFi landscape.","links":"https://mixquity.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mixquity-finance/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x3e452a416dae9f0bf4bf69fa0bf529c2b7c7360f"}}}
