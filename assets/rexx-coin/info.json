{"name":"Rexx Coin","id":"rexx-coin","symbol":"rexx","description":"Rexx is a blockchain-based ecosystemâ€”a network of decentralized apps based on blockchain technology. As a decentralized entity itself, Rexx operates through a network of distributed nodes, eliminating the risk of network failure emerging from individual node failures. This also enables peer-to-peer transactions among users within the ecosystem. At its core, Rexx is fueled by the Rexx coin, a utility token that grants access to a range of services and apps within the Rexx Ecosystem. The primary objective of the Rexx project is to \"challenge traditional infrastructures with robust, secure, and efficient blockchain solutions.\" The Rexx Ecosystem intends to build a series of next-gen, blockchain-based solutions (decentralized apps) that will reshape how traditional industries and systems work, driving innovation through widespread blockchain adoption and knowledge. Much like blockchain, a technology that benefits various industries, Rexx's inclusive ecosystem doesn't limit itself to a single niche. Instead, it encompasses and offers blockchain solutions for various sectors, like gaming, trading, news, payments, and supply chain management.","links":"https://coinrexx.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/rexx-coin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
