{"name":"Shiba Inu","id":"shiba-inu","symbol":"shib","description":"Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a meme token which began as a fun currency and has now transformed into a decentralized ecosystem. During the initial launch, 50% of the supply was allocated into Vitalik Buterin's ethereum wallet. As a result of that, Vitalik proceeded to donate 10% of his SHIB holdings to a COVID-19 relief effort in India and the remaining 40% is burnt forever. That donation was worth about $1 billion at that time, which makes it one of the largest donation ever in the world. What is the Shiba Inu community working on right now? The Shiba Inu team launched a decentralized exchange called Shibaswap with 2 new tokens, LEASH and BONE. LEASH is a scarce supply token that is used to offer incentives on Shibaswap. BONE is the governance token for holders to vote on proposals on Doggy DAO.","links":"https://shibatoken.com/","market_cap":7789175491,"market_cap_rank":16,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/shiba-inu/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x95ad61b0a150d79219dcf64e1e6cc01f0b64c4ce"}}}
