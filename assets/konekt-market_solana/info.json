Each number is minted as an NFT and becomes the user’s key for private calls, encrypted messaging, wallet access, USDC transfers, and future pay-per-action features. Konekt focuses on user-owned identity, real peer-to-peer communication, and a secure privacy layer designed for the next generation of Web3 applications.","links":"https://konekt.market/","market_cap":131679,"market_cap_rank":6582,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/konekt-market/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"9GuqvJbdtSrK6JNHKTvi742T75ShGv1R1ieTmEutpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/9GuqvJbdtSrK6JNHKTvi742T75ShGv1R1ieTmEutpump"}},"is_native":false}
