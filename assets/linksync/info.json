LinkSync Token is a hyper-deflationary token with a maximum circulating supply of 1Q (quadrillion) on the Binance Smart Chain blockchain, that involves an inaccessible burn wallet. Depending on each holder’s percentage of ownership, a 12% transaction tax is distributed among all holders—this includes the burn wallet, which is essentially a holder that collects more tokens over time as transactions occur. As the circulating supply decreases, the scarcity of the token increases. This inversely proportional relationship constitutes, a supply and demand model. There is no limit of how many tokens can be burnt. Without a burning limit, holders get to enjoy a never-ending cycle of passive income with positive price pressure!","links":"https://linksync.tech","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/linksync/logo.png"}
