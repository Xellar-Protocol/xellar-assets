{"name":"Based Hotdog","id":"based-hotdog_base","symbol":"botdog","description":"$BOTDOG is a utility meme coin created to bridge the gap between web3 communities and real-world utility. Built on top of the Cliza System, $BOTDOG reallocates 80% of creator rewards to fund the global expansion of “Based Hotdogs” — a next-gen hotdog franchise brand focused on premium, creative glizzy where 5% of all profits will be put into the chart for buybacks and burns. The remaining 20% supports ongoing development, marketing, art, and community initiatives. $BOTDOG is more than a coin — it’s a movement powered by memes, food, and decentralized ownership.","links":"https://toekn.com/BOTDOG","market_cap":42379,"market_cap_rank":8467,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/based-hotdog/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x37d6080ca82e42db3cf94a6fd07416cdd419a4a4","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x37d6080ca82e42db3cf94a6fd07416cdd419a4a4"}},"is_native":false}
