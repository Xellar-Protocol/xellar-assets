{"name":"linSpirit","id":"linspirit","symbol":"linspirit","description":"LiquidSpirit is a wrapped version of inSPIRIT. It is designed to unlock holder’s position by opening up a whole new market for linSPIRIT, while still being able to enjoy weekly volume based fees from inSPIRIT. Users can then swap their SPIRIT for linSPIRIT at a 1:1 ratio using our LiquidSwapper. In order to trade their linSPIRIT back to SPIRIT, users will need to use a DEX, such as SpiritSwap. When users swap SPIRIT for linSPIRIT, we lock the SPIRIT forever on a weekly basis. We then use the inSPIRIT received to boost yields for the SPIRIT-FTM, wETH-FTM and wBTC-FTM pairs, increasing yields for xLQDR holders. Previous experiments have shown that this strategy can be a massive success. Convex’s cvxCRV alone has attracted a market cap of over 300 million USD. Although users seem to accept the peg for products like these, it is ultimately market forces that control the price.","links":"https://www.liquiddriver.finance/linspirit","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/linspirit/logo.png","detail_platform":{"fantom":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc5713b6a0f26bf0fdc1c52b90cd184d950be515c"}}}
