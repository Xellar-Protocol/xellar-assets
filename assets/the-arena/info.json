{"name":"The Arena","id":"the-arena","symbol":"arena","description":"The Arena is a next gen social finance application on Avalanche that redefines how creators connect, engage, and monetize their content, with our target users being content creators that are crypto-curious and have a desire to better monetize than they can on current web2 social platforms. Our platform is a solution to the growing creator economy. As a true SocialFi app, we combine the best aspects of social networks with the financialization offered by cryptocurrency to allow creators to monetize to a greater extent than they could elsewhere. Creators earn more on The Arena, and users are able to find up and coming content creators and support them.","links":"https://arena.social/","market_cap":21050760,"market_cap_rank":1291,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/the-arena/logo.png","detail_platform":{"avalanche":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb8d7710f7d8349a506b75dd184f05777c82dad0c","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/avax/tokens/0xb8d7710f7d8349a506b75dd184f05777c82dad0c"}}}
