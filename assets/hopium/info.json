{"name":"HOPIUM","id":"hopium","symbol":"$hopium","description":"HOPIUM ($HOPIUM), the pioneering hope-themed meme coin on the XRP Ledger, stands out by blending motivational memes with the robust functionality of the XRPL. This fusion elevates $HOPIUM beyond a mere token, establishing it as a community-driven movement. The $HOPIUM community actively promotes its message of hope through social media platforms like X and TikTok, using memes, uplifting slogans, and a sense of unity to spark excitement and participation. The primary goal of the $HOPIUM community is to foster growth, with significant potential due to its first-mover advantage on the XRPL. We’re not losing. We’re early. Chart red? Mood green. Inject more hopium. Lambo by Q4 (probably). Memecoins: Your favorite one is down 93%. That’s not a crash.. that’s deep value territory. NFTs: Floor is lower than your sleep schedule, but hey… “it’s about the art” Community sentiment: “Bro trust me, the halving hasn’t kicked in yet”","links":"https://x.com/HOPIUMonXRPL","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/hopium/logo.png","detail_platform":{"xrp":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"rk9Egj7nqrfX3tXDPUubrTrwqqwsBSqSs","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/xrpl/tokens/rk9Egj7nqrfX3tXDPUubrTrwqqwsBSqSs"}}}
