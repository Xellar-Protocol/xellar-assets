{"name":"Arbitrage Loop","id":"arbitrage-loop_solana","symbol":"arb","description":"$ARB is a project that aims to generate passive income using arbitrage trading bots to create volume for the project. The developer has created multiple liquidity pools, such as PUMP/ARB or BONK/ARB pairs. ARB prices fluctuate differently across these pools due to paired token movements, creating price discrepancies between pools. Arbitrage bots continuously scan for these opportunities, buying ARB cheaper from one pool and selling higher in another. Each arbitrage transaction pays the 4% tax, distributing rewards to holders and funding new liquidity pairs.","links":"https://arbitrageloop.com/","market_cap":4022.47,"market_cap_rank":12647,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/arbitrage-loop_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"EDcdVtzW4HG7Xtg5yH3RbzMEyfudg63RmZgdXpQFUk3s","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/EDcdVtzW4HG7Xtg5yH3RbzMEyfudg63RmZgdXpQFUk3s"}},"is_native":false}
