{"name":"MiniPanther","id":"minipanther","symbol":"mp","description":"MiniPanther DAO is a 14-day DAO followed by 80% treasury buybacks on Day 15. After that, it will become the meme token of the Fantom Network. Outside staking partnership with Dark Knight offers bonus rewards for staking. The normal treasury withdrawal function is disabled. The creators have no direct access to treasury funds. Staking rewards are given for the first 14 days. Bonding/minting is available for the first 11 days, building the treasury (3-day vesting). At the end of the first 14 days, the amounts in all treasury bonds besides MP-DAI LP are calculated; 80% is liquidated and used for MP buybacks & burns on the untouched MP-DAI LP within the next 24 hours. 20% is sent to the contract operators as an administration fee. Part of the administration proceeds will be used for black cat-related donation. If any of the 80% buyback funds remain unspent after day 15, anyone can call a function that conducts a buyback & burn using all remaining buyback funds. MP then becomes the meme token of the Fantom ecosystem. After the first 14 days, no new supply can be minted However, stakers will still receive rewards via proportional redistribution of the 6.66% transaction tax on selling.","links":"https://minipanther.money/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/minipanther/logo.png"}
