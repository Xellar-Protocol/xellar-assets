{"name":"Picasso","id":"picasso","symbol":"pica","description":"Picasso is a DeFi infrastructure-focused Layer 1 protocol designed to address the challenges of cross-chain interoperability and security. It achieves this by extending the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol to connect multiple ecosystems, including Solana, Ethereum, Cosmos, and Polkadot. Picasso functions as a cross-ecosystem IBC hub, enabling secure asset transfers and facilitating the cross-pollination of assets, builders, and communities between these networks. The project also introduces a Generalized Restaking Layer, allowing users to enhance the security of various blockchain networks by restaking assets across multiple Proof-of-Stake (PoS) systems.","links":"https://www.picasso.network/","market_cap":5575423,"market_cap_rank":2322,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/picasso/logo.png","detail_platform":{"picasso":{"decimal_place":12,"contract_address":"ppica"},"cosmos":{"decimal_place":12,"contract_address":"ibc/F4A4D751F3C3E0545E44EBE27B2FE53AEC1603595ABE06CDF2FF86903D590A63"},"osmosis":{"decimal_place":12,"contract_address":"ibc/56D7C03B8F6A07AD322EEE1BEF3AE996E09D1C1E34C27CF37E0D4A0AC5972516"},"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"966vsqwoS3ZBrHesTyAvE7esFV2kaHaDFLLXs4asPdLJ"},"ethereum":{"decimal_place":12,"contract_address":"0xbb63a9b64a80e9338b8ea298c51765e57c4f159c"}}}
