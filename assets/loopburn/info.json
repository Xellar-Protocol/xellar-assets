{"name":"LoopBurn","id":"loopburn","symbol":"lbp","description":"$LPB is a deflationary ERC-20 token on the Sonic network designed to boost trading volume and incentivize liquidity - all without relying on token taxes. Through a unique burn-and-recycle mechanism, LoopBurn attracts liquidity yield farmers while continuously reducing the total supply of $LPB over time. Through its automated burn and buyback engine, the protocol reduces supply and increases token velocity fueling long term scarcity and value.","links":"https://lpbsonic.xyz","market_cap":40895,"market_cap_rank":8825,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/loopburn/logo.png","detail_platform":{"sonic":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x001bff4b6da770f445a740227224d3c8b48e6fb2","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/sonic/tokens/0x001bff4b6da770f445a740227224d3c8b48e6fb2"}}}
