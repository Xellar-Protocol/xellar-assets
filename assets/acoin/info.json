{"name":"Acoin","id":"acoin","symbol":"acoin","description":"Acoin was designed from the ground up and is designed to be a rare currency. There is no premine. Only 800,000 to 1,600,000 coins will be issued (this varies due to the random rewards system). The coin reward starts at 1 and halves every 6 months. One in ten blocks will have a reward that is two to ten times the normal block reward.","links":"https://www.acoin.info","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/acoin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
