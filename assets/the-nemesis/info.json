{"name":"The Nemesis","id":"the-nemesis","symbol":"nems","description":"NEMS is the Ethereum payment token that powers The Nemesis, the open-world Metaverse available via desktop and mobile, where players can earn according to the time spent playing thanks to a Play-and-Earn model, and Creators can build virtual worlds and gaming experiences in VR/AR. The NEMS token allows the cash out of COINS earned in game and the purchase of Lands, NFTs and other assets, included in The Nemesis ecosystem. The Nemesis is reimagining the web through its next-generation Metaverse offering; a place without borders where virtual and real-world encounters merge together. The project was built in Switzerland in 2020 to catalyze the mass adoption of Web3 by leveraging the utility of Web2 to seamlessly onboard users from any background or interest to enjoy what they like in the Metaverse. Relevant investors, Brands and influencers (Consensys, Polygon, LandVault, Skoda by Volkswagen, Arnette by Luxottica.. and many more) choose the platform to increase the community engagement through fun gameplays, challenges and live events set in new and surprising high-quality Metaverses.","links":"https://thenemesis.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/the-nemesis/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb435a47ecea7f5366b2520e45b9bed7e01d2ffae"}}}
