{"name":"INVO Shop System","id":"invo-shop-system_solana","symbol":"invo","description":"The current financial system is broken. It is designed to extract value, not create it. Every time you swipe a card, send money, or pay an invoice, a legion of middlemen takes a cut. Payment processors, banks, clearing houses—they all demand their toll for moving bits on a server. Worse than the fees is the friction: slow settlement, opaque chargebacks, and tooling that wasn’t built for global, digital-first commerce. Merchants are forced into stacks that don’t fit how the internet works.","links":"https://www.invo.agency/","market_cap":60813,"market_cap_rank":7932,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/invo-shop-system_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"9DowFjAVk2svDXzFxcfuTgSTHjniW5D6TVaEmxFvpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/9DowFjAVk2svDXzFxcfuTgSTHjniW5D6TVaEmxFvpump"}},"is_native":false}
