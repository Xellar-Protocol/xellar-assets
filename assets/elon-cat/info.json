{"name":"Elon Cat","id":"elon-cat","symbol":"schrodinge","description":"Launched on the 20th of September 2023, Elon Cat $SCHRODINGER is inspired by both the famous quantum physics thought experiment and Elon Musk's cat named Schr√∂dinger. Going by the principles of true decentralization, the liquidity of $SCHRODINGER is locked for 1 year, and the contract is renounced, ensuring a secure and transparent environment for all investors. There is a nominal tax of 1% on each transaction; this tax is used to spread awareness about $SCHRODINGER and to secure important partnerships, propelling $SCHRODINGER to the memecoin hall of fame. Following the success of Elon's dog-inspired memecoin, $FLOKI, $SCHRODINGER, as the only memecoin dedicated to Elon's cat, is on a mission to cement its position as the ultimate cat meme. As a decentralized and community-driven memecoin, $SCHRODINGER aims to use memes as a tool for change in the crypto sphere, aiming to promote unity in the memecoin space.","links":"https://eloncat.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/elon-cat/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x64c79c8c59a2be17c8d651f73e5ee7942eebdc9e"}}}
