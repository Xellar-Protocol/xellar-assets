{"name":"Ponzichu","id":"ponzichu","symbol":"pchu","description":"Ponzichu ($PCHU) is a memecoin launched on the SUI blockchain, inspired by the cultural icon Pikachu. While humorous and meme-driven in its branding, the token introduces a deflationary mechanic designed to sustain long-term holder value: 2% of every transaction is automatically used to buy back $PCHU on the open market and send it to a burn wallet, reducing supply permanently. Ponzichu brings together the fun of meme culture and the innovation of automatic on-chain tokenomics.","links":"https://ponzichu.xyz/","market_cap":61128,"market_cap_rank":7303,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ponzichu/logo.png","detail_platform":{"sui":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x0a2a868f6a8618b599e49f6b49240088d85b93660003da5a066841e28f19d629::pchu::PCHU","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/sui-network/tokens/0x0a2a868f6a8618b599e49f6b49240088d85b93660003da5a066841e28f19d629::pchu::PCHU"}}}
