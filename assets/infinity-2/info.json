{"name":"Infinity","id":"infinity-2","symbol":"8","description":"INFINITY (8) is a self-sustaining, deflationary PoW token designed to leverage Sonic’s FeeM mechanics and create a perpetual flywheel of value and demand. NFINITY is a PoW token programmed for the perpetual growth. Its core design revolves around a direct value feedback loop created by Sonic’s FeeM mechanism – 90% of all gas fees spent on mining Infinity are automatically reinvested into the token. INFINITY introduces the fastest emission reduction schedule ever deployed in a PoW token.","links":"https://8finity.xyz/","market_cap":283988,"market_cap_rank":5249,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/infinity-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"sonic":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x888852d1c63c7b333efeb1c4c5c79e36ce918888","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/sonic/tokens/0x888852d1c63c7b333efeb1c4c5c79e36ce918888"}}}
