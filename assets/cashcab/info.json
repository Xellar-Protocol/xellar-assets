{"name":"CASHCAB","id":"cashcab","symbol":"cab","description":"CashCab is a type of crash gambling game, a genre where players place bets on the multiplier, and the goal is to cash out before the multiplier crashes. In this game, the multiplier steadily increases until it suddenly stops, and if a player cashes out before the crash, they win their original bet multiplied by the current multiplier. The game relies on a Provably Fair Random Number Generator (RNG) to determine the outcome, adding an element of transparency and fairness. It shares similarities with Ethereum betting, as both involve a level of risk and reward. Just as in Ethereum betting, where holding on until winnings gain added value is a strategic choice, in CashCab, players are rewarded for holding their nerve long enough to let the multiplier build. The unpredictability of whether the multiplier will crash early or continue to increase adds a suspenseful and strategic element to the gameplay, making it a game of chance and nerve for participants. As with any form of gambling, players should exercise caution, be aware of the associated risks, and only participate with funds they can afford to lose.","links":"https://cashcab.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cashcab/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x73af41fe7054057218e0eb07fe43ba5f25c7d79f"}}}
