{"name":"SantaSol","id":"santasol_solana","symbol":"ssol","description":"SantaSol ($SSOL) is a festive, community-driven cryptocurrency built on the Solana blockchain. The project aims to spread holiday cheer while providing real utility and long-term value for its holders. SantaSol combines the excitement of the Christmas season with innovative blockchain technology to create an engaging, deflationary token with multiple use cases. Purpose and Function: Community Rewards: A portion of every transaction funds community giveaways, staking rewards, and holiday events like Christmas raffles and lotteries. Charity Contributions: Holders vote on charitable initiatives, ensuring transparency and impact. Deflationary Mechanics: Regular token burns via \"Santa Burns\" events reduce supply, increasing scarcity over time. Utility: Staking Rewards: Holders can stake $SSOL tokens to earn passive rewards, encouraging long-term participation and reducing circulating supply. Holiday Lotteries: Participate in raffles and jackpots funded by transaction taxes, with special prizes on Christmas Day. Liquidity Growth: Transaction taxes also contribute to growing the liquidity pool, ensuring token price stability. SantaSol is more than a token—it’s a movement to create joy, foster community, and innovate within the blockchain space. With transparent governance, deflationary incentives, and community-focused goals, SantaSol delivers a festive yet sustainable crypto experience.","links":"https://santasol.io/","market_cap":8973.56,"market_cap_rank":11510,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/santasol_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"4KMGg8YFKFewZsNuRrfqgDLuR15iVtPxEPe9GyFzpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/4KMGg8YFKFewZsNuRrfqgDLuR15iVtPxEPe9GyFzpump"}},"is_native":false}
