A totally ridiculous coin that's shaking up the crypto world with a pie in the face. Inspired by the legendary Three Stooges, this coin is here to prove that not everything in life has to be serious.

Stooges.io isn't just a coin, it's a joke you can buy, sell, and most importantly, share!","links":"http://stooges.io/","market_cap":739261,"market_cap_rank":2972,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/stooges/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"AHnZ7VyyQ5jHXbitQL8tuN7ciGG66EvCnU7eKoKX99fz"}}}
