Users deposit cbETH to Astrid main contract and receive back rcbETH on a 1:1 ratio. Pooled LSTs/ETH are then divided and restaked to multiple different operators on EigenLayer. rcbETH is a rebaseable token (rebased daily), i.e. rewards are distributed via a rebase to keep the 1:1 peg of cbETH:rcbETH.","links":"https://astrid.finance","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/astrid-restaked-cbeth/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe38149abc673a117abeb8af7d1ff3d0d1aa5af15"}}}
