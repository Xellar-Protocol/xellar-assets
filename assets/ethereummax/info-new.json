{"name":"EthereumMax","id":"ethereummax","symbol":"emax","description":"EthereumMax (EMAX) is a progressive ERC-20 token built on the secure Ethereum network. We launched EMAX with a vision to bridge the gap between the emergence of community-driven tokens and the well-known foundational coins of crypto, creating a unique token that provides lifestyle perks with financial rewards and incentives to its holders with a pathway for practical long-term use in everyday life. This is the essence of the Culture Token. EMAX launched with a total supply of 2 quadrillion tokens, yet that circulating supply continues to decrease as our tokenomics include a 0% tax on buys, a 9% tax on sells and transfers, 3% of which remains in treasury and 6% is burned every other week. To start on the right foot and to establish EMAX as a long-term project, we had no biased pre-sale event as 100% of the tokens were released on the open market, we locked liquidity to support the project, and founder wallets have been locked and verified as a sign of commitment to deepen trust within the community. EMAX is a long-term project with a bold vision, strategic roadmap, and united community to accomplish lofty goals few have ever imagined, let alone conquered â€“ and we plan on doing just that.","links":"https://www.ethereummax.org/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ethereummax/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x15874d65e649880c2614e7a480cb7c9a55787ff6"},"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x123389c2f0e9194d9ba98c21e63c375b67614108"}}}
