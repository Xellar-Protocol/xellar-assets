{"name":"Luxury Travel Token","id":"luxury-travel-token","symbol":"ltt","description":"Launched in 2023, Luxury Travel Token (LTT) is a project that utilizes cryptocurrency to bring about change in the luxury travel industry. LTT provides token holders with access to special travel experiences, including journeys on luxury trains and extended stays at high-end villas. The project's core focus is the development of a luxury train equipped with hotel-like amenities and services. Holding LTT tokens grants individuals priority access to these travel experiences and various benefits. LTT has established strategic collaborations with major travel agencies and railway companies to bring its luxury travel services to fruition. The funds raised through token sales will be allocated towards the construction of the train and villas, as well as the operation of the project. LTT strives to contribute not only to the experiences of token holders but also to the economic development of the regions where the train and villas operate. Looking ahead, the project intends to expand its services to desirable travel destinations around the world, extending its reach beyond Japan.","links":"https://lt-t.io","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/luxury-travel-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x3f91ad19af450b44cf5176b4de719d77cb19eec7","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x3f91ad19af450b44cf5176b4de719d77cb19eec7"}}}
