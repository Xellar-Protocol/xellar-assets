DOLA Borrowing Rights: DBR's provide the holder the right to borrow DOLA in FiRM. DBR’s solve issues of highly volatile interest rates in traditional variable rate lending and DBR removes many of the constraints of conventional fixed rate interest lending in DeFi. Users benefit from the certainty of fixed-rate loans while gaining both short and long-term optionality and opportunities from DOLA Borrowing Rights.","links":"https://www.inverse.finance/","market_cap":1594328,"market_cap_rank":3201,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dola-borrowing-right/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xad038eb671c44b853887a7e32528fab35dc5d710","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xad038eb671c44b853887a7e32528fab35dc5d710"}},"is_native":false}
