{"name":"World Computer Money","id":"world-computer-money","symbol":"wcm","description":"World Computer Money (WCM) is a community-driven ERC-20 token on Ethereum that plays on the long-standing “world computer” narrative around the Ethereum Virtual Machine. The project positions WCM as a cultural/meme asset rather than a protocol with promised yields or product features. It exists primarily for on-chain transfer and trading, with initial liquidity and price discovery occurring on Uniswap; the project communicates via its X account and Telegram.","links":"https://worldcomputermoney.com/","market_cap":634928,"market_cap_rank":4802,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/world-computer-money/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x692353f0bebb3e53301b626edb10eee6040b45fe","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x692353f0bebb3e53301b626edb10eee6040b45fe"}}}
