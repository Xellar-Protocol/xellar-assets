{"name":"DeFi Growth Index","id":"defi-growth-index_ethereum","symbol":"dgi","description":"The DeFi Growth Index tracks the performance of early-stage DeFi projects that demonstrate innovative mechanisms and established market demand, with strong potential for significant growth in user base, transaction volume, and/or Total Value Locked (TVL) as relevant. This is achieved through a curated portfolio of tokens native to these projects. Decentralized Token Folios (DTFs) are onchain portfolios that bundle multiple crypto assets into a single token. DGI is an Index DTF deployed and curated by Today in DeFi on the Reserve Protocol (reserve.org), which supports two main DTF categories: Yield DTFs and Index DTFs.","links":"https://app.reserve.org/ethereum/index-dtf/0x9a1741e151233a82cf69209a2f1bc7442b1fb29c/overview","market_cap":70877,"market_cap_rank":7620,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/defi-growth-index/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x9a1741e151233a82cf69209a2f1bc7442b1fb29c","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x9a1741e151233a82cf69209a2f1bc7442b1fb29c"}},"is_native":false}
