{"name":"Community Metaverse","id":"community-metaverse","symbol":"comt","description":"In the world of crypto-currency, there are an abundance of projects and tokens. And the idea of creating an ecosystem that is driven by the community is not new. But the main problem in all these projects is that they are driven by developers. They are pseudo-community-driven. Now, Community Metaverse is here to solve this problem and present a truly transparent and fully community-driven ecosystem! Our model is very simple. It gives our holders full authority to make decisions (through our Voting System) on which direction to take, and which products to create.","links":"https://www.communitymetaverse.space/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/community-metaverse/logo.png"}
