{"name":"Cope man","id":"cope-man_solana","symbol":"cope","description":"Fr, you know this guy. He's in your replies rn. I was the main character. My takes were fire. My memes are God-tier.. My whole personality was being right online. Then the vibe shifted. The timeline cooked me. My epic takedown thread was giving... cringe. Everyone just replied \"touch grass.\" I didn't delete my account. I just locked the replies and posted \"can't argue with bots lol.\" They say I'm just a Cope Man in my villain arc. Yep,I'm just huffing pure, uncut $COPE. 1 Billion $COPE for every time you said \"I was just trolling\" after getting cooked. Here, we don't take L's. We rebrand them as performance art. We don't touch grass. We mainline the feed. Because when you're terminally online, delulu is the only solulu.","links":"https://copeman.xyz/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cope-man_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"5YagDj7SVZ1WJaQBeSxPTPxqiNHepAu53w3CP3cXhJ2Z","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/5YagDj7SVZ1WJaQBeSxPTPxqiNHepAu53w3CP3cXhJ2Z"}},"is_native":false}
