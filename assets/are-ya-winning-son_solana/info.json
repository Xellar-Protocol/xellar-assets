{"name":"ARE YA WINNING, SON?","id":"are-ya-winning-son_solana","symbol":"son","description":"ARE YA WINNING, SON? ($SON) is a whimsical Solana-based memecoin built around the legendary “Are ya winning, son?” meme. A 2014‐era MS Paint comic in which a father walks in on his son playing a hentai VR game and casually asks, “Are ya winning, son?” Ever since, the meme has evolved into a flexible template for gaming culture, parental poking fun, generational gaps and existential internet humor. $SON taps into that viral nostalgia with a tongue‑in‑cheek identity, offering the Solana community a humorous, low‑market‑cap token riding on meme momentum. Designed for meme collectors, gamers and crypto pranksters, $SON embraces irreverent fun while aiming to build virality-driven social traction—because at the end of the day: Dad, your $SON is winning.","links":"https://son.meme/","market_cap":289064,"market_cap_rank":5369,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/are-ya-winning-son_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"AdxNrCntq6YkYC2qVffF2Fw7WC1UatKhV8J6G4ekgNx3","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/AdxNrCntq6YkYC2qVffF2Fw7WC1UatKhV8J6G4ekgNx3"}},"is_native":false}
