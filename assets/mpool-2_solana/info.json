It enables any project to create their own staking pool within minutes — without giving up token custody, without relying on risky third-party contracts, and with complete transparency on rewards, lock durations, performance, and fees. Projects gain utility, holders earn passive income, and everything runs securely on-chain.","links":"https://mpool.fun/","market_cap":3338.88,"market_cap_rank":12834,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mpool-2_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"pv5TUu7tVbV9NgqBrfbEfQ2bTCULuNXdbP4kgHrpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/pv5TUu7tVbV9NgqBrfbEfQ2bTCULuNXdbP4kgHrpump"}},"is_native":false}
