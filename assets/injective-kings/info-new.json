{"name":"Injective Kings","id":"injective-kings","symbol":"ikings","description":"Injective Kings is a decentralized finance (DeFi) project built around the $IKINGS token, which serves as the linchpin of its ecosystem. Beyond being a tradable asset, $IKINGS holds diverse purposes, including governance power, staking, exclusive rewards, and utility within the Injective Bank, the core of the project. $IKINGS token holders play an active role in community decision-making, influencing the project's trajectory. By staking $IKINGS, holders demonstrate loyalty, earn rewards, and contribute to community strength. Ownership of $IKINGS also entails exclusive rewards, fostering a vibrant community experience. Practically, $IKINGS facilitates fee payments and unlocks premium features within the financial system. The top priority is the establishment of the Injective Bank, a comprehensive DeFi platform boasting a user-friendly dashboard, borrowing and lending services, and loan facilities. Future plans encompass the introduction of a token swapper and a token launchpad, positioning Injective Bank as a frontrunner in the DeFi space. The initial total supply of $IKINGS tokens is 5 trillion, distributed across token sales, NFT holders, marketing, team development, and liquidity. As of February 19, 2024, the total supply has been reduced to 4 trillion tokens, enhancing the project's overall dynamics.","links":"https://injectivekings.com/","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/injective-kings/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":null}}}
