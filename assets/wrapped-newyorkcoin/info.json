{"name":"Wrapped NewYorkCoin","id":"wrapped-newyorkcoin","symbol":"wnyc","description":"WNYC stands for Wrapped NewYorkCoin and is simply an BEP-20 token that represents NewYorkCoin. One WNYC equals one NYC. NYC can be converted into WNYC and vice-versa. Being an BEP-20 token makes the transfer of WNYC slower than normal NewYorkCoin, but the key advantage of WNYC is its integration into the world of Ethereum wallets, dapps, and smart contracts.","links":"https://wrappednyc.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wrapped-newyorkcoin/logo.png"}
