{"name":"The ILLUSION Project","id":"the-illusion-project","symbol":"illusion","description":"The ILLUSION Project is a meme project built to evolve with the times by remixing and reimagining pop culture. It blends mainstream web 2 pop culture with web 3 crypto native degen culture, making it a cultural bridge between web 2 and web 3. At first glance, it has everything expected from a memecoin, including Avukadu, a half-cat, half-avocado mascot with endless parody potential. But beneath the surface lies something deeper—a hidden race of alien refugees made of cosmic slime, lurking in the backend of the site.","links":"https://gen-jut-su.com","market_cap":6073.56,"market_cap_rank":10025,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/the-illusion-project/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"Hq7keg9Z7HqRMJUyhEodUSnjEdbGcATU3wGsraUDpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/Hq7keg9Z7HqRMJUyhEodUSnjEdbGcATU3wGsraUDpump"}}}
