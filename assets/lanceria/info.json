{"name":"Lanceria","id":"lanceria","symbol":"lanc","description":"Lanceria Ecosystem is an upgraded version of the existing freelancing marketplaces aiming to solve the diverse challenges faced by freelancers and their employers by removing the massive fees charged by the available freelancing sites. For freelancers, these can go up to 20 percent, while employers usually have to pay about five percent extra; Lanceria will eliminate the former and greatly slashes the latter. Lanceria will also enable transactions in cryptocurrencies, effectively removing any third-party payment processing platforms and the associated expenses. Lanceria, the hope of freelancers and their employers, uses the revolutionary blockchain technology and will serve as a perfect substitute for existing freelance platforms. The core features of blockchain technology, such as transparency, immutability, scalability, and accessibility, would provide a robust foundation for the platform's automated features and foster trust among the stakeholders. Its LANC token is backed by an entire community of sellers and buyers, freelancers and employers. Our goal is to create a unique platform, implement special services, and use cryptocurrencies as a secure, fast, and reliable payment method. We can do this because we fight for freelancers' monetary rights. We are the modern knights. We are Lancerians.","links":"https://lanceria.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/lanceria/logo.png"}
