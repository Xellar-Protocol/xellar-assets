{"name":"NodeQAI","id":"nodeqai_ethereum","symbol":"nqai","description":"As blockchain ecosystems diversify, the operational burden on node and validator operators has intensified. Today’s multi-chain landscape demands near-perfect uptime, rapid protocol upgrades, and robust security, yet existing tools remain siloed, manual, and reactive. NodeQ AI introduces a new paradigm: a unified, AIdriven control plane that automates the entire node lifecycle. From Infrastructure-as-Code provisioning and real-time telemetry aggregation to machine-learning risk forecasts and self-healing automation playbooks, NodeQ AI empowers operators to anticipate failures and resolve issues before they impact network performance. Built on a modular, cloud-native architecture, NodeQ AI scales effortlessly across diverse Proof-of-Stake and EVM networks, while the native NQAI token powers service billing and operator incentives.","links":"https://www.nodeq.ai","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nodeqai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x5ead27fcc5bc50aa100da635f8d1e6198acee71c","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x5ead27fcc5bc50aa100da635f8d1e6198acee71c"}},"is_native":false}
