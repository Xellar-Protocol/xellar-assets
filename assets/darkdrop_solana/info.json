{"name":"DarkDrop","id":"darkdrop_solana","symbol":"darkdrop","description":"DarkDrop enables irreversible, anonymous value transfers on Solana mainnet using temporary burner keypairs. The sender funds a freshly generated keypair and receives a claim code (base58 private key or AES-encrypted variant). The receiver imports the burner, sweeps funds to their main wallet, and the burner is discarded. Operational privacy depends on sender using a disposable wallet for funding. Mathematical privacy extensions (Token-2022 confidential transfers + Light Protocol) are on the public roadmap.","links":"https://darkdrop.app/","market_cap":27555,"market_cap_rank":9170,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/darkdrop_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"Ezn7q7Mrp8Asij8SQrT6BiuCU9RhRcEv4S8jDfiBpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/Ezn7q7Mrp8Asij8SQrT6BiuCU9RhRcEv4S8jDfiBpump"}},"is_native":false}
