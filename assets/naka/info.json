{"name":"Naka","id":"naka","symbol":"naka","description":"At the core of NAKA’s evolution is the MEOW DAO, a clear reflection of our commitment to true decentralized governance and community empowerment. A DAO — or Decentralized Autonomous Organization — is a blockchain-based framework where decisions are made democratically, with members voting transparently on proposals that shape the project’s future. NAKA is now transitioning into a fully decentralized DAO, giving every NAKA token holder the right to vote on important matters. This means the community will have a direct say in key decisions — from new product launches and partnerships to ecosystem development and marketing strategies. The MEOW DAO represents much more than a management system; it is the heartbeat of NAKA’s community initiative, designed to enhance both the utility of the NAKA token and the active involvement of its holders. With this shift, NAKA moves beyond being just a crypto project and becomes a community-powered movement that thrives on collective vision and shared responsibility. By embracing the ethos of decentralization, the MEOW DAO ensures that NAKA will remain a leader in community-led innovation and governance, driven by the voices of those who believe in it most. Every vote, every proposal, and every decision will be recorded transparently on-chain, keeping NAKA’s growth aligned with the will of its community.","links":"https://www.nakathecat.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/naka/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xac2c0505b953d8679230b564c1bf1836673e311a","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xac2c0505b953d8679230b564c1bf1836673e311a"}}}
