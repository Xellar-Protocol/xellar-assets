{"name":"Aeonix Network","id":"aeonix-network_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"onix","description":"aeonix network is a modular AI network that combines web3 infrastructure, decentralized identity, and tokenized incentives to create verifiable and private AI applications. The flagship product, aeonix explorer, functions as a universal AI Agent search engine with a natural language interface, enabling users to access unique and hidden insights, interact with dApps, verify AI outputs, and earn rewards for ecosystem participation. Unlike traditional AI services, aeonix is built as a private AI model: user data is never stored or used for external training, and organizations can deploy custom AI functions with full control over their data. This approach supports both public-facing AI agents (for search and community engagement) and private enterprise solutions (for secure data processing and automation). aeonix bridges research and application, combining years of work in decentralized identity, token economics, and private AI systems into a single network. Its mission is to demonstrate how verifiable and privacy-preserving AI can operate at scale—providing a foundation for both consumer-facing products and enterprise-grade AI solutions.","links":"https://www.aeonix.network/","market_cap":13432.88,"market_cap_rank":10572,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/aeonix-network/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x3d16a8bd2806dc7907abbe36911cff779474a694","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x3d16a8bd2806dc7907abbe36911cff779474a694"}},"is_native":false}
