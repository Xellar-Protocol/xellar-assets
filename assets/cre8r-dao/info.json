{"name":"CRE8R DAO","id":"cre8r-dao","symbol":"cre8r","description":"CRE8R DAO was founded in June 2021 by a group of DeFi content creators with the goal of organizing content creators into a DAO format. The goal was to create an opportunity for marketing content creators to have a place to monetize their platforms without the need for them to do sales pitches and chase payments for services rendered. The idea was that they could focus on the content and have the heavy lifting of business development and sales spread out across the DAO.","links":"https://cre8r.vip/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cre8r-dao/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xaa61d5dec73971cd4a026ef2820bb87b4a4ed8d6"},"fantom":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x2ad402655243203fcfa7dcb62f8a08cc2ba88ae0"}}}
