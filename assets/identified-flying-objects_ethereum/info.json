{"name":"Identified Flying Objects","id":"identified-flying-objects_ethereum","symbol":"ifo","description":"The IFOnetwork introduces a decentralized global network designed to create a single, verified, real-time map of the sky. By leveraging a global network of citizen-scientists, advanced AI analysis, and the immutability of the Ethereum blockchain, IFOnetwork aims to identify, track, and classify all objects in Earth's atmosphere and low orbit. The native ERC20 token, $IFO, is the economic engine of this ecosystem, incentivizing data contribution and fueling the long-term vision of a transparent and monetizable data marketplace. Our mission begins with cataloging the sky and expands to providing critical, verifiable data on a global scale, including the long-term goal of monitoring weapons systems to promote transparency and global security.","links":"https://www.ifo.network/","market_cap":17552.72,"market_cap_rank":10021,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/identified-flying-objects_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x3664487e8a9b90662441aef57060486a5217704d","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x3664487e8a9b90662441aef57060486a5217704d"}},"is_native":false}
