{"name":"rarecoin","id":"rarecoin_solana","symbol":"rarecoin","description":"Rarecoin positions itself as the rarest coin on Solana — built on the belief that scarcity, community, and time create lasting value. In a market driven by hype, rarecoin’s vision is to redefine what value means in the meme economy — showing that a memecoin can evolve into a true digital collectible, the PSA10 Charizard of Solana. Using http://BONK.fun’s supply feature, the token’s total supply was hard-capped at 10 million from inception. It is paired with USD1, the stablecoin of World Liberty Finance (WLFI).","links":"https://rarecoinonsol.xyz","market_cap":80180,"market_cap_rank":7400,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/rarecoin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"GWaD6wcxSZFwXApoY56x6Cxiqs5sAvtQNdcUvz7Zbonk","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/GWaD6wcxSZFwXApoY56x6Cxiqs5sAvtQNdcUvz7Zbonk"}},"is_native":false}
