{"name":"BaseSafe","id":"basesafe_base","symbol":"safe","description":"The Base Safe $SAFE token project introduces a novel cryptocurrency ecosystem centered around the $SAFE token and the BaseSafe DApp. The purpose of the project is to provide a sustainable and potentially profitable investment opportunity for users through innovative tokenomics and arbitrage mechanisms. Key features of the project include: $SAFE Token: A cryptocurrency operating on the Base Chain with a unique approach to increasing its value over time. BaseSafe DApp: A decentralized application acting as a digital piggy bank, collecting ETH from swap taxes. The value of $SAFE tokens is determined by dividing the total ETH in the DApp by the number of $SAFE tokens in circulation. Token Burn and ETH Return: Selling $SAFE tokens to the DApp results in token burning and ETH payout, potentially maintaining or increasing the value per token. Arbitrage Opportunities: Price discrepancies between Uniswap and the DApp incentivize users to engage in arbitrage, buying low and selling high to support the token's value. Base Chain Integration: Built on the Base Chain to leverage low transaction fees, enhancing the efficiency of trading and arbitrage strategies. Overall, the Base Safe $SAFE token project offers a transparent and accessible entry point into cryptocurrency investment, catering to both beginners and experienced investors. Through its innovative tokenomics and strategic mechanisms, it aims to sustain and potentially increase the value of the $SAFE token over time.","links":"https://basesafe.org/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/basesafe/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xbd15d0c77133d3200756dc4d7a4f577dbb2cf6a3","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xbd15d0c77133d3200756dc4d7a4f577dbb2cf6a3"}},"is_native":false}
