{"name":"Inuki","id":"inuki_solana","symbol":"inuki","description":"The Lucky Shiba from East China is a meme token born with serenity and style deployed with love on @BONKDOTFUN. This small-eyed, big-bagged Shiba doesn’t chase charts it meditates before mooning. Fusing Eastern meme aesthetics with Solana degen culture, it’s calm, chaotic, and full of charm. With community-driven energy, unique branding, and playful minimalism, Lucky Shiba stands out as a symbol of silent strength and surprising fortune. The moon is inevitable but only after meditation.","links":"https://www.inuki.club","market_cap":5120.6,"market_cap_rank":12332,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/inuki/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"5td6aHmUZxii1QharcgZ3k1iKU6ajKVtiPz19snKbonk","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/5td6aHmUZxii1QharcgZ3k1iKU6ajKVtiPz19snKbonk"}},"is_native":false}
