Bagels optimizes transaction processes to maximize liquid mining positions and maximize returns for miners. Deposit users in addition to can get high interest, but also can get deposit mining income, borrowing users can get leverage mining income, according to deposit and borrow the share of the corresponding BAGEL governance token reward. Holders of the currency can pledge BAGEL to participate in DAO's decentralized governance, become a board member of Bagels Finance, and receive a 50% dividend on Bagels platform revenue. One of the biggest highlights of Bagels is the implementation of multi-chain leveraged liquidity mining. Bagels V1 will be deployed in BSC/HECO/Polygon tri-chain, enabling vault farming and leveraged farming of multiple mainstream assets. At Bagels, utilization rate of the deposit pool can be up to 99%.Users' deposit rates will generally be higher than other DeFi lending platforms. The borrowing rate depends on the leverage multiple chosen by the user. The higher the leverage multiple, the higher the interest rate will be, but the borrower can get BAGEL rewards for leveraged mining.","links":"https://app.bagels.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bagel/logo.png"}
