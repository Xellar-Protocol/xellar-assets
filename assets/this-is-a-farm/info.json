{"name":"This is a Farm","id":"this-is-a-farm","symbol":"farm","description":"This token is a satirical take on the trend of so-called “farmers” — projects that launch coins purely to extract liquidity from users with little to no real utility. Unlike typical farmer tokens, this project is fully transparent about its purpose as a parody and social commentary. Importantly, 100% of the creator fees are directed to charity, not personal profit, aligning with a mission to turn crypto hype into real-world good.","links":"https://pump.fun/coin/BdTEJq3yEp68SNmeBfqBbDDy7nbSGftkDhDkVef6pump","market_cap":279672,"market_cap_rank":5945,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/this-is-a-farm/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"BdTEJq3yEp68SNmeBfqBbDDy7nbSGftkDhDkVef6pump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/BdTEJq3yEp68SNmeBfqBbDDy7nbSGftkDhDkVef6pump"}}}
