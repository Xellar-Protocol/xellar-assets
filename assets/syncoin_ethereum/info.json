{"name":"Syncoin","id":"syncoin_ethereum","symbol":"snc","description":"Syncoin (SNC) is the native token of the CryptSync wallet ecosystem, built to combine real-world utility with decentralised finance. With a fixed supply of 1.618 million tokens, Syncoin powers exclusive in-app staking, DAO governance, and cross-chain liquidity pools, while offering yields of up to 52% APY. A cornerstone of the project is CS Pay, an NFC-enabled payment system that allows users to spend Syncoin in everyday transactions, bridging blockchain technology with practical retail use. The tokenomics model incorporates a 1% transaction tax to sustain liquidity, governance, and a buy-and-burn mechanism, ensuring long-term ecosystem stability.","links":"https://cryptsync.io/","market_cap":1256632,"market_cap_rank":3475,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/syncoin_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6b8952d61e2cd41a284ffd250deb021a709bdc1c","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x6b8952d61e2cd41a284ffd250deb021a709bdc1c"}},"is_native":false}
