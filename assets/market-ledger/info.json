{"name":"Market Ledger","id":"market-ledger","symbol":"ml","description":"Market Ledger intends to change the way we interact with Cryptocurrency as a whole. It will essentially be providing the one-stop-shop for all of your needs whilst also simplifying the journey you need to go through from start to finish. Imagine a place where everything is in one place for trading DeFi (Decentralised Finance) tokens from having a dex swap, charts, analytical data, to latest news, trending tokens, etc. All presented in a clean and user-friendly way. Simply put consider only having to go to one single place – Market Ledger, to gather all the information, whereas currently you need to go to Poocoin, PancakeSwap, Uniswap, YouTube, Telegram, CoinMarketCap, etc. We will be taking a phased approach with the development and release of the platform. The rationale is two pronged – we will be able to expedite the delivery of certain features to be able to bring forward beta testing. Additionally, through this testing we will be able to gather feedback along the way to ensure it is user intuitive and truly suits the needs of each individual investor.","links":"https://marketledger.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/market-ledger/logo.png"}
