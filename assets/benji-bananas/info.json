{"name":"Benji Bananas","id":"benji-bananas","symbol":"benji","description":"What is the project about? Benji Bananas is a physics-based mobile game launched in 2013 as a casual and accessible arcade title to appeal to a broad audience. Since its launch, it has continued to have a strong user base, amassing over 50 million downloads across the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. The majority of the ~5 billion internet users worldwide go online using mobile phones, and over 3.2 billion of those users play video games. This suggests that the mass adoption of blockchain will benefit powerfully from products that include mobile and game components. The BENJI Token leverages Benji Bananas, a successful mobile game with a daily active player base of 70,000 unique players at the time of writing. The goal of the BENJI Token project is to connect the Benji Bananas player base with the possibilities of Web3, introducing thousands of new users to the cryptoverse every month. Like any fungible token, $BENJI is only part of the Web3 experience. In order to earn $BENJI, players must obtain a Benji Bananas Membership Pass NFT, which is necessary in the Benji Bananas’ play-to-earn system. What makes your project unique?
