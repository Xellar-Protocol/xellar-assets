{"name":"Oracle Degen","id":"oracle-degen_solana","symbol":"odegen","description":"Oracle Degen is an automated prediction market platform built on Solana that specializes in memecoin events. The platform uses an Automated Market Maker (AMM) model to determine betting odds algorithmically, similar to how decentralized exchanges like Jupiter operate for token swaps. Users can place predictions on various memecoin-related outcomes such as price movements, exchange listings, and market capitalization milestones. The platform operates on a transparent, decentralized model where odds are calculated using the constant product formula based on betting pool ratios. Unlike traditional prediction markets where platforms set odds through opaque algorithms, Oracle Degen's odds are determined purely by market forces and liquidity pool balances. The platform charges a 2% fee only on winning payouts and never takes positions against users, ensuring no conflict of interest.","links":"https://www.oracledegen.fun/","market_cap":3269.1,"market_cap_rank":12852,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/oracle-degen_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"5Gzs2DxqK44fK3ob2LuxdmLfYRyuUe1QeE9MRSM3pump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/5Gzs2DxqK44fK3ob2LuxdmLfYRyuUe1QeE9MRSM3pump"}},"is_native":false}
