{"name":"VitaStem","id":"vitastem_base","symbol":"vitastem","description":"VitaSTEM — The first AI-enabled longevity project and inaugural IP-Token launched by Aubrai, VitaDAO’s decentralized scientific agent. After six months of deep research on public and proprietary single-cell RNA-seq and multi-omics datasets, our scientific research team analyzed more than 850,000 human hematopoietic stem cell transcriptomes from donors aged 23–91 (both male and female). This effort uncovered 100+ high-potential rejuvenation target genes and revealed critical drivers of decline such as RhoA hyperactivation, CD38 upregulation, and CCR9 downregulation. Rather than treating HSC aging as a single defect, Aubrai recognized it as convergent damage across interconnected systems, generating a comprehensive multi-modal, five-phase rejuvenation protocol targeting transcriptional stress, metabolic dysfunction, and epigenetic drift in parallel. The agent shortlisted target genes using insights from thousands of peer-reviewed publications and private data and also optimized experimental protocols to guide in vitro and upcoming pre-clinical testing. For the first time, human researchers and AI Agents collaborate as co-scientists in the creation of pioneering scientific IP.","links":"https://app.bio.xyz/ipts/vitastem","market_cap":213240,"market_cap_rank":5820,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/vitastem_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x5d4d258144bc954aefc00ee6cbda0433b1b2dcd3","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x5d4d258144bc954aefc00ee6cbda0433b1b2dcd3"}},"is_native":false}
