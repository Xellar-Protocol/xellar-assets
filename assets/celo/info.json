Some uses include: Running a validator to secure and operate aspects of the Celo Platform Voting for validators working to secure and operate the Celo Platform Participating in governance decisions to influence the future of the Celo Platform Supporting applications on the platform cGLD forms part of the overcollateralized reserve that supports the Celo stable value assets (initially Celo Dollar or cUSD).
