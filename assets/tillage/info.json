{"name":"Tillage","id":"tillage","symbol":"till","description":"\"TILL\" is an innovative coin to learn and enjoy agriculture, a key market on earth, and to be rewarded through this process. \"TILL\", which means arable land, is period coin. You can use \"TILL\" to own and manage a variety of innovative and stable crops. Whereas existing coin projects seek to maintain or increase coin prices by mobilizing issues that promote the influx of coin users, \"TILL\" can directly intervene in the production, distribution, and profit distribution of grains and goods to secure the profits of the project itself have. \"TILL\" is a rice-based coin, and profits from milling and sales will continue to be invested in increasing the value of the coin, thereby objectifying the market value of \"TILL\". Coins are created in the market by purchasing rice for milling, and coins will be consumed in the market because they buy as much as they generate profits. Afterwards, the target will be expanded to other crops as well as rice, and the purchase and sale of seasonal agricultural products in the international spot market will be expanded to share these profits. Thus, it has a long-term prospect as a global currency that overcomes the non-convertibility of legal tender in the way of the rice standard system.","links":"https://tillagechain.com","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/tillage/logo.png","detail_platform":{"klay-token":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x2e1cf529dbd26f5f62a89ba723f2918de72f2487"}}}
