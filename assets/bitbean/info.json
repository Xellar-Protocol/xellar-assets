{"name":"BitBean","id":"bitbean","symbol":"$bitb","description":"BitBean ($BITB) is a revival of a beloved coin launched long ago back in 2015, originally as it's own network token, Bean Cash Network. More recently, a revival initiative was launched on Solana about 7 months ago, but fell short on momentum and started to fade. Now, a group of people who have fond appreciation for the whimsical bean of financial success have banded together to revive the project by means of a traditional CTO. Now, with a plethora of memes, a strong community of bean-loving people, and the organization to drive strong growth, BitBean is on trajectory to truly fly high. It is important to note that from a functionality standpoint, BitBean on Solana is nothing more than a standard memecoin, and is not intended to be used for anything other than just that.","links":"https://www.bitbeanonsol.vip/","market_cap":122491,"market_cap_rank":5947,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bitbean/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"9jBg9QnpGLmPB58Fmp5L7fbwk1kJ7HYcaziRdPR7yRQJ"}}}
