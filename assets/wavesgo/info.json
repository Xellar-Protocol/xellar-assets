{"name":"WavesGo","id":"wavesgo","symbol":"wgo","description":"WGO is the official WavesGo token and the complete supply is being airdropped for free to the Waves community as well as participants of our mining pool. We share a part of our profits with WGO holders to let them participate in a service provider of the Waves community. The WavesGo token is currently being traded on the Waves Decentralized Exchange and Tidex. WGO is being distributed over 3 months (from April to July 2017). Between those dates, you can receive WGO by holding WCT (the Waves Community Token), by leasing Waves to the WavesGo LPOS pool, or simply buying directly from the market using the Waves DEX or other exchanges.","links":"http://www.wavesgo.com/wgo","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wavesgo/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
