{"name":"Ethane","id":"ethane","symbol":"c2h6","description":"What is the project about? Ethane allows for a simple gasless user experience by outsourcing transactions involving ERC-20 tokens to an intermediary smart contract that is then called by a Relayer. In addition, Ethane also provides a cost-efficient liquidity locker solution allowing a user to approve and lock their Uniswap liquidity tokens in one transaction. What makes your project unique? Ethane rewards stakeholders fees from all gasless swap transactions and from other projects locking liquidity. History of your project. Ethane began on the idea of transferring tokens from one user to another without the user paying gas via the permit function found in several ERC-20 smart contracts. Whatâ€™s next for your project? Ethane provides gasless and staking services on the Ethereum blockchain. Ethane services will be deployed on other chains such as Polygon and BNB Chain. Gasless transactions are possible via signatures following the EIP-712 standard. Following the deployment of the Ethane services cross-chain, the EIP-712 standard will also be utilized for gasless transactions involving NFTs. What can your token be used for? Users can swap tokens on Ethane without needing Ethereum to pay gas for their transaction. No holding of Ethane is required to use this swap.","links":"https://ethane.app/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ethane/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x6ad9a31f02f1e790ff85584ea3c3d0001e45cd64"}}}
