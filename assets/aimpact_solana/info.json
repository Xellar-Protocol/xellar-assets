{"name":"AImpact","id":"aimpact_solana","symbol":"aim","description":"AImpact is an intelligent crypto-asset management platform designed to simplify the complexity of cryptocurrency trading and DeFi operations by leveraging advanced artificial intelligence. According to aimpacttoken.com, the project aims to deliver a “one-command execution” experience, enabling users to trade, rebalance portfolios, stake assets, farm yields, and perform multi-chain operations with minimal manual effort. At the core of AImpact is a proprietary AI decision engine that analyzes real-time market data, on-chain activity, and historical trading patterns to execute optimized strategies, reduce human error, and enhance overall efficiency. This AI model continuously adapts to changing market conditions, identifying profitable opportunities and adjusting portfolio allocations in a data-driven manner. One of the platform’s key innovations is chain abstraction, which allows users to interact with multiple blockchains seamlessly without needing to manually bridge assets or switch networks. The system automatically selects the best liquidity route and the most cost-effective execution path across chains, improving speed and reducing fees. AImpact also provides an open API and SDK, enabling integration with wallets, exchanges, and other Web3 applications so that its AI-powered automation can be embedded into external platforms. The ecosystem is driven by its native token, AIM, with a total supply of one billion tokens. AIM is used to pay for AI-powered services, access advanced features, and receive fee discounts. Users can stake AIM to earn rewards, contribute to liquidity, or even train personalized AI models tailored to their risk preferences. Token holders also participate in governance, influencing decisions on AI model updates, strategic directions, and protocol improvements. The token distribution prioritizes ecosystem growth and liquidity, with additional allocations supporting development, marketing, the team, and user rewards. AImpact’s value lies in its ability to make digital-asset management more intuitive and efficient. By automating complex DeFi actions and trading processes, it removes barriers for newcomers while offering sophisticated tools for experienced investors seeking faster, more precise execution. Its combination of multi-chain functionality, adaptive AI strategies, and customizable investment options positions AImpact as a next-generation platform aimed at transforming how individuals and institutions manage their crypto portfolios. With its unified, AI-driven approach, AImpact presents a vision of effortless, intelligent, and highly accessible asset management for the evolving Web3 economy.","links":"https://www.aimpacttoken.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/aimpact/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"4c53VeEq8jVA9EoeGAz9tBC9hhNYHj5quwrMDqEiYxM3","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/4c53VeEq8jVA9EoeGAz9tBC9hhNYHj5quwrMDqEiYxM3"}},"is_native":false}
