{"name":"HashRush","id":"hashrush","symbol":"rush","description":"Hash Rush is a PvE focused online RTS game. You will start on your own planetoid, will need to build your colony, and defend yourself against the monsters of the Crystal Scourge. Hash Rush uses blockchain in two ways only: The first way is to power our in-game currency (RUSH). This currency is used in exactly the same way as any other game-premium currency. Use cases are in-game store purchases, player to player trades (auction house), and as a resource to improve the quality of your buffs/crafted items. The second way is to power the in-game items. When this system is turned on, it will mean that you are able to trade the items within the game or take them out of the game and trade them in a private setting.","links":"https://hashrush.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/hashrush/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
