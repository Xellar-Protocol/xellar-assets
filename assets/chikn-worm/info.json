{"name":"Chikn Worm","id":"chikn-worm","symbol":"worm","description":"$WORM is the primary token used for Crafting and Foraging in the Chikn ecosystem. The little wrigglers beneath the dirt are often overlooked, but any gardener will tell you just how important $WORM are. Living beneath your FarmLand NFT, $WORM help turn over soil, bringing valuable resources and crafting blueprints to the surface. At launch, the token was billed as a replacement for $FEED rewards that were approaching exhaustion. Like $FEED, players generate $WORM through their LP Farm.","links":"https://chikn.farm/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/chikn-worm/logo.png"}
