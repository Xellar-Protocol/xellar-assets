{"name":"WAGMI On Solana","id":"wagmi-on-solana","symbol":"wagmi","description":"WAGMI is an abbreviation of We're All Going To Make It. We are a community of like minded individuals who love the Solana ecosystem and want to create a community economy of our own. We will market through mass airdrops throughout the ecosystem to bring in new people into the community. We plan to create a WAGMI DEX, NFT drops and more to support our community economy. There will be much more but for now we would like to get the Solana ecosystem together and create something positive.","links":"https://wagmionsolana.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wagmi-on-solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"3m7A2A8HHdqmiDrjAfaddj7Hxd88FrBHA1KSoqjoELtu"}}}
