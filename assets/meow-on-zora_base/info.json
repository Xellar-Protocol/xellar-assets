{"name":"Meow on Zora","id":"meow-on-zora_base","symbol":"meow","description":"This project uses Zora’s onchain coin rails to link educational content to observable market signals. One coin represents the creator profile, and individual posts can mint their own tradable coins. Each coin’s market is a Uniswap v4 pool, so prices and depth reflect demand. Fees on each trade are split by the protocol to reward the creator and eligible referrers. The objective is to fund ongoing primers, risk guides, and research with a transparent fee model rather than custodial ad revenue or paywalls.","links":"https://zora.co/@mr_lightspeed","market_cap":214545,"market_cap_rank":5806,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/meow-on-zora/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd91857eeb279922cc72b6b3f543aea6ca465f5a5","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xd91857eeb279922cc72b6b3f543aea6ca465f5a5"}},"is_native":false}
