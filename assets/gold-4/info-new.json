{"name":"Gold","id":"gold-4","symbol":"gold","description":"The new Defi mode solves some of the problems with current defi tokens GOLD coins combine the dual mechanism of added liquidity pool (LP) mining and black hole destruction mining. This design not only attracts more liquidity into the ecosystem, but also effectively reduces the supply of tokens on the market, thereby boosting the scarcity and value of tokens. Through the black hole destruction mechanism, GOLD coins can effectively deal with the small bottom pool and token issuance problems common in traditional DeFi projects. This design ensures the sustainability of the project and reduces the risk of inflation, making the value of the asset more secure for the coin holder. GOLD is committed to building a strong community ecosystem that promotes the participation and contribution of community members through transparent governance mechanisms and fair distribution strategies. This not only enhances user loyalty, but also contributes to the health of the entire ecosystem.","links":"https://nborncapital.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gold-4/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8b6fba73454101d537d51d5b12614a01067cd168"}}}
