{"name":"Real World Assets","id":"real-world-assets","symbol":"rwa","description":"THE ROLE OF RWA WEB 3.0 PROBLEM SOLVING The RWA track was created to solve some of the problems that existed in traditional financial markets, such as lack of liquidity, lack of transparency, and high transaction costs. Its purpose and significance is to bring real-world assets into the blockchain world, making it possible for more people to participate in this market, and at the same time bringing new competitiveness to the traditional financial market. ADVANTAGES OF RWA lies in the fact that it can increase the liquidity and transparency of assets, while also reducing transaction costs. However, there are also some challenges in the RWA track, such as lack of standardization and insufficient regulation. Compared with traditional finance, the biggest difference of RWA track is that it adopts blockchain technology, which makes the tokenization and trading of assets more convenient and transparent. LOWERING THE THRESHOLD The traditional financial sector sets certain thresholds due to compliance and risk prevention needs, such as the starting investment requirements for hedge funds, private equity funds and venture capital funds, which makes it impossible for most ordinary investors to participate. RWA solves this problem through fragmentation, allowing more retail investors to participate in the investment process. DECENTRALIZED GLOBAL ASSET INVESTMENT RWA allows investors to participate in global high-quality asset investment in a decentralized way. Through RWA, more retail investors can hold U.S. bonds and obtain stable income. In addition, the pricing of high quality assets in emerging market countries is affected by the instability of local currencies, and through the RWA model combined with a decentralized stablecoin, accurate pricing of high quality assets can be achieved.","links":"http://www.rwacoin.top","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/real-world-assets/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x57bfcf7bb43a3cae0aab981e2585a9e32d069f29"}}}
