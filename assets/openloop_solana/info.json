{"name":"OpenLoop","id":"openloop_solana","symbol":"opl","description":"OpenLoop.Network is a decentralized wireless network that reimagines how internet connectivity is delivered and used. By leveraging cutting-edge decentralized infrastructure, OpenLoop transforms unused internet bandwidth into a powerful resource that fuels technological innovation, rewards users, and supports the growing demands of artificial intelligence (AI). At its core, OpenLoop is designed to enhance internet service delivery through the use of a distributed framework. Unlike traditional centralized networks, OpenLoop operates on principles of decentralization, where users contribute small amounts of unused bandwidth to build a robust and reliable network. This contribution creates a scalable ecosystem that meets the increasing demands of AI data processing and other high-performance technologies.","links":"https://openloop.so/","market_cap":3823.05,"market_cap_rank":12717,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/openloop/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"3mXoWmUd3LcWEhtY1vQwuXwRnnhn6h5SQHnXbWqpXopL","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/3mXoWmUd3LcWEhtY1vQwuXwRnnhn6h5SQHnXbWqpXopL"}},"is_native":false}
