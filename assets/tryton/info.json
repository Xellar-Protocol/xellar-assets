{"name":"TryTON","id":"tryton","symbol":"trt","description":"TryTON is a decentralized wallet application designed to facilitate multi-network token holding and trading across major blockchains, including TON, Solana, Ethereum, Base, and Binance Smart Chain. Through a specialized bridge mechanism, TryTON allows users to transfer TRYTON tokens across these networks while stabilizing the exchange rate through independent pools. This system equalizes the coin’s value across networks, providing predictability and enhancing the token’s resilience against individual network fluctuations. In addition, TryTON introduces a gamified referral airdrop system that incentivizes user participation. The game enables users to earn TRYTON coins through daily interactions and referrals, further encouraged by NFT accelerators that enhance earning potential. A set percentage of mined coins can be withdrawn daily after listing on BSC, offering a structured token release. This combination of multi-chain functionality, bridge stability, and gamified user incentives is central to TryTON’s mission of expanding TON network accessibility and usability across blockchain ecosystems.","links":"https://tryton-on-ton.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/tryton/logo.png","detail_platform":{"the-open-network":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"EQBEbKm5z-T5psz8iRtCRYjDH-OGbRAsfhQtdKf1ma2dqS7o","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/ton/tokens/EQBEbKm5z-T5psz8iRtCRYjDH-OGbRAsfhQtdKf1ma2dqS7o"}}}
