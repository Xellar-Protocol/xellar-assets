Additionally, they plan to launch a distributed cloud computing network in which users can rent, play, and stream video games using the combined power of the network's contributors. The PLA token is the blood of this entire ecosystem, itself built upon the ecosystem that is the VeChainThor blockchain, which gives Plair the scalability advantages it needs to succeed over competitors.","links":"https://plair.life/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/plair/logo.png","detail_platform":{"vechain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x89827f7bb951fd8a56f8ef13c5bfee38522f2e1f"}}}
