{"name":"Decred-Next","id":"decred-next","symbol":"dcrn","description":"Decred-Next is a new public chain generated by a hard fork after Decred was upgraded to V1.7 due to a disagreement in the community consensus. Decred-Next retains the mixed consensus mechanism of 60% POW, 30% POS and 10% treasury of the original Decred. It has excellent characteristics such as high safety, strong adaptability and sustainable development. Additionally, we plan to implement EVM, sharding, OmniLayer and other features in the future. Compared to the current Decred, Decred-Next will be more efficient, robust, dynamic and competitive.","links":"https://dcrn.xyz/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/decred-next/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
