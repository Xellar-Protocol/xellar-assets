{"name":"Arch Balanced Portfolio","id":"arch-balanced-portfolio","symbol":"abal","description":"The Arch Balanced Portfolio (ABAL) belongs to our family of portfolios and is aimed to strike the perfect balance between stability and growth. ABAL is a curated selection of Arch's assets providing stability through USD-pegged yield-bearing strategies, with exposure to major cryptocurrencies, and Web3 protocol tokens. What sets our portfolio construction apart is our innovative methodology, which includes subset resampling. This technique enhances the efficiency of the mean-variance optimization process, enabling us to identify the most efficient portfolios with the highest expected returns for a given level of risk. Our Arch Balanced Portfolio is ideally rebalanced quarterly, allowing us to make adjustments based on market conditions or performance. The ABAL portfolio is available to swap, mint, and redeem on the Polygon network.","links":"https://app.arch.finance/products/portfolio/arch-balanced-portfolio","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/arch-balanced-portfolio/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf401e2c1ce8f252947b60bfb92578f84217a1545","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/polygon_pos/tokens/0xf401e2c1ce8f252947b60bfb92578f84217a1545"}}}
