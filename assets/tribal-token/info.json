{"name":"Tribal Token","id":"tribal-token","symbol":"tribl","description":"Small-and-medium businesses (SMBs) are essential to emerging market economies, employing the majority of workers in markets like Latin America. Despite their economic importance, emerging market SMBs are routinely denied the financial services they need to grow. Tribal is changing that paradigm. The Tribal Token (TRIBL) powers a robust financial ecosystem, including tools to help businesses earn exciting rewards, enjoy discounts, and enjoy smoother access to credit. Tribal Credit uses the Tribal Token and other blockchain-powered tools to enhance financial services for the 2,000 emerging market enterprises it serves.","links":"https://tribl.ltd","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/tribal-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6988a804c74fd04f37da1ea4781cea68c9c00f86"}}}
