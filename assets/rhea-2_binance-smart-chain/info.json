{"name":"RHEA","id":"rhea-2_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"rhea","description":"The current DeFi landscape is highly fragmented—yield opportunities are spread across multiple chains, protocols, and wallets, creating a steep learning curve for users. To access the most efficient strategies, users often need to navigate different ecosystems, bridge assets across chains, and manage multiple wallets, increasing complexity, cost, and risk. This fragmentation makes it difficult for everyday users to participate in DeFi confidently and profitably. RHEA addresses these issues by offering a unified, cross-chain platform that integrates the NEAR ecosystem's top DeFi primitives—Ref (DEX) and Burrow (lending)—with seamless BTC bridging via the Satoshi Bridge. Users can deploy capital and generate yield from a single Bitcoin wallet, eliminating operational friction while improving capital efficiency and access to higher yields. RHEA transforms a fragmented experience into a simple, streamlined, and cost-effective solution for earning yield across chains.","links":"https://rhea.finance/","market_cap":3153964,"market_cap_rank":2494,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/rhea-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x4c067de26475e1cefee8b8d1f6e2266b33a2372e","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x4c067de26475e1cefee8b8d1f6e2266b33a2372e"}},"is_native":false}
