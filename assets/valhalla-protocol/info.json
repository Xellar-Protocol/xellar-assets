{"name":"Valhalla Protocol","id":"valhalla-protocol","symbol":"val","description":"Valhalla is a decentralized & distributed layer 2 deep-learning training protocol on the BNB Smart Chain. Providing cost-efficient & faster training of deep neural networks. Valhalla solves latency issues by chunking the data into small pieces (bytes), maintaining its identity, and then distributing it across a host of devices with a call to action: gradient calculations. This is how deep-learning training takes place in our ecosystem using BNB Smart Chain and incentivizing those who contribute with their computing resources in exchange for Valhalla Tokens.","links":"https://valhallanet.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/valhalla-protocol/logo.png"}
