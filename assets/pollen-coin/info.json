{"name":"Pollen Coin","id":"pollen-coin","symbol":"pcn","description":"Pollen Coin (PCN) is a utility token for the Pollen Mobile cellular network, built on Solana. Pollen Mobile is a protocol building decentralized wireless (DeWi) networks, similar to Helium. Anyone can buy and deploy hardware that provides Internet connectivity and earn tokens in return for the quality of coverage they provide and the amount of data transfer that is serviced by their hardware. Decentralized wireless networks built on blockchains provide much cheaper Internet connectivity than traditional, centralized wireless providers along with greater privacy and anonymity. PCN is purchased and spent to fund data transfer and Internet connectivity.","links":"https://www.pollenmobile.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pollen-coin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"GWsZd8k85q2ie9SNycVSLeKkX7HLZfSsgx6Jdat9cjY1"}}}
