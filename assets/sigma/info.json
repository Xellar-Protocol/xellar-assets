{"name":"Sigma","id":"sigma","symbol":"sigma","description":"In the world of cryptocurrency, a \"Sigma\" would represent a personality type that is self-reliant, independent, and strategic. They often choose to navigate the crypto market outside of traditional investment frameworks. Instead of following the herd mentality or aligning with dominant financial trends - akin to the \"Alpha\" -, they prefer to operate in their own unique way. They prioritize personal freedom, make well-researched decisions, and value the ability to remain adaptable in the ever-evolving landscape of digital currencies. Their approach to investing is defined by a mix of confidence, nonconformity, and a deep understanding of market dynamics.","links":"https://solsigma.org/","market_cap":37671505,"market_cap_rank":1005,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/sigma/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"5SVG3T9CNQsm2kEwzbRq6hASqh1oGfjqTtLXYUibpump"}}}
