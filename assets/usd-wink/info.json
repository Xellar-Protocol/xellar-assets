{"name":"USD WINK","id":"usd-wink","symbol":"usdw","description":"WINK is a unified digital ecosystem that bridges the gap between traditional (Web2) and decentralized (Web3) platforms. By creating a single account, users can access a wide range of services—social networking, decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, gaming, and more—all in one place. WINK, the native utility token, represents the project's overall value and channels the profits generated from all profit streams. These profits are pooled together to create a foundation for incentives and rewards to sustain the buyback fund. This system ensures that each activity's success contributes to the entire ecosystem's growth and stability while continuously driving value back to the WINK token holders.","links":"https://wink.finance/","market_cap":276979,"market_cap_rank":5964,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/usd-wink/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xab670fdfb0060bdc6508b84a309ff41b56ccaf3f","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/polygon_pos/tokens/0xab670fdfb0060bdc6508b84a309ff41b56ccaf3f"}}}
