OUR BELIEF? MONKEY JPEGS ARE THE REAL DIGITAL GOLD. We're here to put an end to the low-T, beta behaviour and usher in a more Tradlife in crypto. Say goodbye to frogs and dogs, it's time to honor our closest ancestor—the Monkey. That's why 10% of the MONK supply will be distributed to holders of Monkey/ape-related crypto and NFT projects like BAYC, MAYC, y00ts, and more. Together, we'll defeat shitcoin degeneracy Join the movement, become a MONK today, and help us cleanse crypto of all the degeneracy. MONKs break free from the Matrix, boldly entering a life of freedom and generational wealth. Degeneracy has no place in crypto; we promote healthy Apeing. What's the difference? To Ape into something means fearlessly venturing into the unknown, blazing trails. To be a degen is to trade shitcoins in your parents' basement, lurking in the shadows. Forget frogs and dogs. Let's honor our closest ancestors—the Monkey. That's why 10% of the MONK supply goes to holders of BAYC, MAYC, y00ts, HAPE, Prime Ape Planet, GalacticApes, Chimpers, OnChainMonkey, and other Monkey-related crypto/NFT projects. They contribute to Monkey's growth and lead the battle against shitcoin degeneracy.","links":"https://monkcoin.wtf/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/monkcoin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x1028083026fe1e8e1e79170ceae0edbad07b052d"}}}
