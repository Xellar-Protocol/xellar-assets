{"name":"Tritcoin","id":"tritcoin","symbol":"trit","description":"$TRIT is a next-generation token powering Fractal Tech Corp’s quantum-secure encrypted blockchain, built on base-3 (ternary) cryptography. Utilizing 3466-TRIT encryption, zk-SNARKs, and Reed-Solomon error correction in GF(3^m), the project enables post-quantum secure transactions, encrypted audio NFTs, and privacy-preserving smart contracts. Unlike traditional blockchains that rely on binary cryptographic methods, $TRIT introduces a ternary-based encryption model, making it inherently more resilient to quantum computing attacks. The ecosystem supports on-chain encrypted audio NFTs, allowing artists and collectors to securely store, trade, and verify digital assets with integrated zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for privacy. Built on Solana, $TRIT ensures fast, low-cost transactions while maintaining a high level of cryptographic security. The project is designed to facilitate private DeFi transactions, encrypted media ownership, and a decentralized marketplace, offering quantum resistance and advanced encryption solutions for blockchain applications.","links":"https://tritcoin.vercel.app","market_cap":147287,"market_cap_rank":6882,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/tritcoin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"9eXC6W3ZKnkNnCr9iENExRLJDYfPGLbc4m6qfJzJpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/9eXC6W3ZKnkNnCr9iENExRLJDYfPGLbc4m6qfJzJpump"}}}
