ORI, the Orijent Fan Token, introduces a game-changing innovation at the crossroads of cryptocurrency innovation and football dynamism. ORI constitutes the cutting-edge decentralized solution for shareholder management as well as staked investments that represent tangible assets. Moreover, ORI represents the central unit of a decentralized vesting platform created by HNK Orijent 1919 and Juice d.o.o., to invest in the careers of soccer players and profit from their development and success. Ultimately, ORI aims to distribute the decentralized technology to stakeholders involved in sports like football and e-sports. Without a purpose, fan tokens have no future. Nonetheless, when integrated into real-world use cases such as tangible assets and as a payment mechanism, they become future-proof investments. Overall, tangible stake tokens enable rapid and huge gains while maintaining a sustainable growth rate. Thus, ORI paves the way for each club's digitalization plan by establishing a shared economy that benefits both holders and clubs.","links":"https://ori-token.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/hnk-orijent-1919-token/logo.png"}
