{"name":"JOOCE Memecoin Index","id":"jooce-memecoin-index_base","symbol":"jmx","description":"The JOOCE platform provides access to the JOOCE Memecoin Index ($JMX) that offers multi-chain exposure to the top memecoins in crypto through a single token. The composition of the JOOCE Memecoin Index is managed by the $JOOCE token holders. $JOOCE holders can lock their tokens to acquire voting power (VP) and then use that VP to vote for their favorite memecoins. The more votes a memecoin gets the greater its weight will be in the next rebalancing.","links":"https://jooce.xyz","market_cap":342048,"market_cap_rank":5097,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/jooce-memecoin-index/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x83190636c344cf1220ffcbfc0c1198f7867b3667","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x83190636c344cf1220ffcbfc0c1198f7867b3667"}},"is_native":false}
