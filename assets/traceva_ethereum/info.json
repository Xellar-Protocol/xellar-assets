{"name":"Traceva","id":"traceva_ethereum","symbol":"trcv","description":"modular protocol designed for allowing total control of digital identities, data, and interactions by users and autonomous agents Traceva is a privacy-native, modular protocol designed for allowing total control of digital identities, data, and interactions by users and autonomous agents. It is built on top of advanced zero-knowledge cryptographic primitives. Traceva is a unified environment where identity verification, anonymous transactions, encrypted messaging, decentralized storage, and verifiable private access are enabled without compromising user anonymity or traceability. The core goal of Traceva is building a decentralized, highly scalable solution for real issues of digital identity exposure, transactability, and data privacy. With zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs cryptography, decentralized identifiers (DIDs), verifiable credentials (VCs), stealth addresses, and decentralized storage (IPFS/Filecoin/Arweave), all of your transactions in Traceva remain provable but invisible, enabling trust without disclosure.","links":"https://traceva.ai/","market_cap":3263.58,"market_cap_rank":12854,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/traceva_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd7264c9a5bd13aba25ec7724e72629edb9e92e46","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xd7264c9a5bd13aba25ec7724e72629edb9e92e46"}},"is_native":false}
