{"name":"FOREVER","id":"forever_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"forever","description":"ForeverDAO is a decentralized protocol building the programmable infrastructure for personal health data ownership. Instead of remaining siloed in hospitals, laboratories, or corporate clouds, ForeverDAO enables individuals to collect, encrypt, and control their genomic, biometric, and clinical information directly through its SOMA Framework (Source-Oriented Medical Architecture). Powered by blockchain and enriched with AI, ForeverDAO ensures that health data is self-sovereign, portable, and privacy-preserving. Users contribute their verified health data through a multi-agent system (Collector, Validator, Standardizer, Privacy, Trainer, Reward Agents) and are directly rewarded with $FOREVER tokens from the Incentives Vault. This creates a fair data economy where contributors participate in governance, earn value, and fuel continuous AI training — without surrendering their raw data.","links":"https://foreverdao.ai/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/forever/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe389d200de7825db1a0fb62a0a68723920594444","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xe389d200de7825db1a0fb62a0a68723920594444"}},"is_native":false}
