{"name":"Dolphin","id":"dolphin-2_base","symbol":"dphn","description":"Dolphin is a project dedicated to pushing the boundaries of AI model development and distributed inference. Our flagship product is Dolphin Network – A Decentralized AI Inference Network. The goal of Dolphin Network is to allow gamers & other GPU owners to repurpose their GPUs during idle periods by powering a portion of our inference network. By processing a portion of the network’s requests, they are able to earn $DPHN tokens which can later be used for inference or sold on the market to recoup the cost of the GPU. The integrity of the network is upheld through a mix of encryption, randomly sampled validation & cryptoeconomic bonding.","links":"https://dphn.ai","market_cap":7621784,"market_cap_rank":1765,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dolphin-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe2b76f98fb5dc10a9aed0f4a4a854de325740019","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xe2b76f98fb5dc10a9aed0f4a4a854de325740019"}},"is_native":false}
