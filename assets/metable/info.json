{"name":"Metable","id":"metable","symbol":"mtbl","description":"What is the project about? Metable, a groundbreaking metaverse that aims to create a virtual world based on blockchain, is set to transform the landscape of online education. By merging virtual reality, blockchain, and education, Metable empowers teachers, students, and creators with new opportunities for business, teaching, learning, social interaction, and earning. Metable is a metaverse developed with graphics technology that will allow people to explore and experience the metaverse in both 3D and virtual reality (VR) modes through the use of viewers. Technological development will be divided into 2 phases: ● Step 1: 3D exploration. In phase 1 the world will be explorable and livable in 3D using any PC, tablet or smartphone. ● Step 2: VR exploration. In phase 2 the world will also be explorable by exploiting virtual reality (with the use of viewers) making the experience completely immersive. The choice will always be optional in order to allow people to choose the modality they prefer. What makes your project unique? History of your project. What’s next for your project? What can your token be used for?","links":"https://www.metable.in/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/metable/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0c1eb50007974c4e017a6eccf751110bac287ebb"}}}
