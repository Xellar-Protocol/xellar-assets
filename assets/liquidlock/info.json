Liquidlock is hosted on IPFs which guarantees 100% uptime and security against bot attacks. Concerns about rug pulls and exit frauds in the DeFi industry are growing. DeFi rug pulls and exit scams alone amounted to 99% of the $1.9 billion in cryptocurrency frauds in 2020. DeFi100 carried off a $32 million exit scam in May 2021, leaving investors facing significant losses. Project Promoters build a promising cryptocurrency platform, engage in aggressive marketing, solicit funding from investors, and then ghost away with the money raised, abandoning the project. Liquidlock ensures investors that the project developers won't be able to steal their money in a rug-pull and leave them counting losses.","links":"https://liquidlock.xyz/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/liquidlock/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb48ee8f8fa3885fc08831ff366ec8df608159ee9"}}}
