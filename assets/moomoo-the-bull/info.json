This is the origin story that sparked it all. On Thu 12 Jul 2018 at 17:47:28, the first-ever mention of moomoo was created and posted on 4chan by an anonymous user to troll the Business & Finance section of the site. What started as a joke instantly resonated with the community and hours later many iterations of him were made with a different color palette, stripe, and name. But there is no question that this moomoo is the original meme that was overlooked.","links":"https://www.moomoo.wtf/","market_cap":6198042,"market_cap_rank":2185,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/moomoo-the-bull/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"He8S8wC7KQUH7qGWAaLRNFpjqrVyQBwUud34Eyj82AZo","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/He8S8wC7KQUH7qGWAaLRNFpjqrVyQBwUud34Eyj82AZo"}}}
