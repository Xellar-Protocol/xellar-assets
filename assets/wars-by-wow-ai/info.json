Anyone can tag @warstoken on the X platform and smell the ASS™ in action. WOW!? (WOW.AI LLC) aims to acquire Infowars from the Alex Jones bankruptcy estate. If we are successful, we intend to let the people, the token holders, decide its ultimate fate. This does not mean the token is an investment. If someone offers to buy the sites, the money does not go to the token holders. The token holders only get to vote on what happens. Nothing else. If we are unsuccessful in the acquisition, the voices will still have been heard. Our WARS.AI Agent uses WOW!?'s proprietary ASS™ (automated smartass system). The agent will write satirical commentary on news that is best described (says our lawyer Bill) as HAL on shrooms, powered by our ASS™. Anyone can tag @warstoken on the X platform and smell the ASS™ in action. Show your solidarity and beliefs by voting with your $WARS token on what happens to Infowars. Now you can be a part of history. Buy $WARS, stake $WARS, vote with $WARS. Let your voice be heard. By purchasing the $WARS Token, you acknowledge and accept that WOW.AI LLC is not, and cannot, guarantee that it will acquire the Infowars website and related assets. Furthermore, you acknowledge and accept that any bid submitted by WOW.AI may not become the winning bid in the bankruptcy case of In re: Alexander E. Jones (Bankr. S.D. Tex., Case No. 22-33553) or any related matter, and WOW.AI cannot guarantee the ultimate success of its bid. WOW.AI has no control over the Chapter 7 Trustee or the presiding judge in the bankruptcy matter, and the presiding judge has recently indicated that the Chapter 7 Trustee's power to sell the Infowars webpage and assets may be terminated and/or suspended indefinitely. By purchasing the $WARS Token, you knowingly and willingly accept the risk inherent in this transaction, that WOW.AI does not promise or guarantee the acquisition of any Infowars assets, including the Infowars webpage, and agree to release and hold harmless WOW.AI from any claims or causes of action related to the acquisition, or failure to acquire, any of the Infowars assets and webpage, with all such claims and causes of action being expressly waived. It should be known that a lot is up in the air and unclear. On Febuary 5th, 2025, after a long process, the bankruptcy trustee changed his mind and decided that the infowars assets could not be sold and that, maybe, the company that owns infowars might be sold by the bankruptcy trustee.","links":"https://wars.ai","market_cap":52061,"market_cap_rank":8457,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wars-by-wow-ai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xec3d2537a03fc4d790aa1fc66fa7dfadc6b245fb","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xec3d2537a03fc4d790aa1fc66fa7dfadc6b245fb"}}}
