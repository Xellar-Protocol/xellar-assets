Dad Slerf's got this vibe, like, \"This kiddo's gonna flip SOLANA upside down, just you wait.\" Baby Slerf was quick to chat, spitting out \"EAT, HODL, VIBE, SLEEP, REPEAT\" as his mantra. But the real scoop? He was all about letting loose with farts, tearing up the dance floor, and drooling like it's his job. This little sloth, oh boy, was a nighttime ninja, scaling vines to tree tops, eyeing the stars, and screaming \"to the moooooon,\" causing the whole SOLANA animal squad to wake up scratching their heads, like, \"What's with this tiny dreamer?\" Meanwhile, Dad Slerf? Just grinning in silence, 'cause deep down, he knows - this munchkin's heading straight for legend land.","links":"https://babyslerf.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/baby-slerf/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"3K3F9G7zrPd9hPnCDKbBGXwHM85CD1ewLyzNsH51Ry43"}}}
