{"name":"Coldstack","id":"coldstack","symbol":"cls","description":"\"ColdStack is a Decentralized Cloud Aggregator: it is the world’s first service that aggregates Decentralized Data Storages such as Filecoin. It is the fastest, simplest, and easiest way to unleash the power of Decentralized Clouds for projects within the crypto space and beyond. By optimizing storage solutions with its AI-based pipeline, ColdStack provides users with the most cost-efficient and secure way to store their files. ColdStack approach is transparent, immutable, and cryptographically verifiable. The platform provides simple and seamless integration of all the Decentralized Data Storages in one platform. There will also be no need for data migration needed to switch between various Decentralized Clouds. ColdStack features a unified Amazon S3 compatible API which allows users to easily access decentralized storage solutions. By utilizing the $CLS token, users gain access to nearly any decentralized storage, and are no longer required to research the particular strengths of each service in addition to comparing costs. With our implementation of Amazon S3 API compatibility, we also allow individuals to access these services through an interface they are already familiar with, further streamlining a user’s experience. Users can also access a wide range of file permissions and curate their experience based on their data storage needs. The unified API will create easy data storage and retrieval that will be possible from anywhere and anytime. NFTs also add another layer of complexity and fragmentation to decentralized storages, as these must also be stored on their respective networks and marketplaces. The platform has NFT support allowing users to tokneize any uploaded file in ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards. As it currently stands, the ColdStack platform will be the only way a user can store bulk data with Filecoin, 4k photos with Storj, webpages with Arweave, and list NFTs with OpenSea and Rarible, all with one token.\"","links":"https://coldstack.io","market_cap":1571854,"market_cap_rank":3424,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/coldstack/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x675bbc7514013e2073db7a919f6e4cbef576de37"},"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"JCRiQKaujJjAjfVH8CNo4htGFMuTTnZtwvasVwneT7MA"},"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x668048e70284107a6afab1711f28d88df3e72948"}}}
