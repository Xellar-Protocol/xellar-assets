{"name":"fih","id":"fih_solana","symbol":"fih","description":"🐟 FIH’s Origin FIH is a culture-driven meme project inspired by global fishing symbolism, traditional rituals, and modern internet humor. The phrase “FIH is Calling” serves as an invitation to explore the historical and cultural meanings behind fishing and how these themes connect to community practices, shared experiences, and collective identity. The project aims to reinterpret these cultural elements through digital art, narrative content, and social participation. By framing fishing culture as a symbolic bridge between tradition and digital expression, FIH positions itself as a community-oriented project that encourages creative interaction and cultural exploration within the online ecosystem.","links":"https://fih.money/","market_cap":3903329,"market_cap_rank":2291,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/fih_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"8SkfuQkYNTskoQUbbjr2JbZQeqQV9egnJXgfMXf5bonk","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/8SkfuQkYNTskoQUbbjr2JbZQeqQV9egnJXgfMXf5bonk"}},"is_native":false}
