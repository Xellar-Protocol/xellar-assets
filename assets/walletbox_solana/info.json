{"name":"WalletBox","id":"walletbox_solana","symbol":"$wb403","description":"WalletBox is a non-custodial, end-to-end encrypted file storage app for Solana users. Files are encrypted before they leave the device; decryption keys are derived from the user’s wallet signature and are never stored on WalletBox servers. The app uses OpenKitx403 wallet authentication so users can connect read-only (no transaction permissions required) and access encrypted content without passwords or accounts. Builders can integrate WalletBox’s approach in their own apps to provide wallet-bound storage and secure file sharing. WalletBox focuses on privacy by design, simple UX, and open-source components that can be verified and self-hosted by teams that need stronger guarantees.","links":"https://www.walletbox.app","market_cap":9536.94,"market_cap_rank":11276,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/walletbox/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"CXyvYhWSpqEbuTXfhfvDaKfHVHaeA9zU4r11cogdpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/CXyvYhWSpqEbuTXfhfvDaKfHVHaeA9zU4r11cogdpump"}},"is_native":false}
