{"name":"Monster Slayer Share","id":"monster-cash-share","symbol":"mss","description":"MonsterSlayerFinance is an algorithmic synthetics platform: infinite-scalable, long-term sustainable, and decentralized. Our approach to stabilization â€“ implementing best practice of seigniorage combined with a special stabilization fund to limit the effect of post-farming dumping. Monster Slayer Cash tokens are designed to be used as a medium of exchange. The built-in stability mechanism in the protocol deterministically expands and contracts the MSC supply to maintain MSC's peg to 1 $BUSD token (which trades close to a single United States Dollar). During epoch expansions (when TWAP - the time-weighted average price of MSC is above the 1 $BUSD peg), the protocol mints MSC and distributes it proportionally to all Monster Slayer Share (MSS) holders who have staked their tokens inside the boardroom. When MSC's TWAP falls below 1 $BUSD peg, Monster Slayer Bond (MSB) gets issued and can be bought with MSC at its prevailing price.","links":"https://www.monsterslayer.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/monster-cash-share/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xacabd3f9b8f76ffd2724604185fa5afa5df25ac6"}}}
