I-Coin is the currency used in the battle game, metaverse, and the NFT market place. In the Battle Game, players can get free I-Coins by playing the game which is very cool because the background is the story of the struggle of the Indonesian people. In the NFT Marketplace, you can sell your art and also buy other people's artwork in NFT format. This market will facilitate local Indonesian artists and foreign artists to be able to market their artworks to the international arena, very easily. Meanwhile, in the city of Metaverse, we named it Baliverse. Who doesn't know and dream of living in Bali? Well, I-Coin is the only token that provides a real experience as if living in Bali. Baliverse is equipped with beautiful beaches, exotic mountains, and typical Balinese houses and villas, and of course the dances of the great Balinese arts and culture. Very interesting isn't it? The I-Coin blockchain is on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) platform and will be integrated with other platforms such as Ethereum ERC 20 or Solana in the future. One of the goals is so that I-Coin tokens can be staked, so that later it will be more profitable for users and maintain price stability in the market. \"","links":"https://www.icoinglobal.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/i-coin/logo.png"}
