{"name":"Gata","id":"gata_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"gata","description":"Gata creates the decentralized AI supercomputer by orchestrating global compute and storage resources. It delivers decentralized, yet data-center-grade inference and training at a fraction of the cost—fully supporting large models. Gata enables AI teams to break free from hyperscaler lock-in, access affordable AI from decentralization, and build the decentralized infrastructure that will truly power the $1 T AI economy. ---Backed by $4M--- Backed by YZi Labs, IDG Blockchain, Maelstrom, Gate Ventures, & more ---Highlights--- - $100 B+ addressable market - AI inference & training are the backbone of the $1 T AI economy - >90% cost savings – trade modest latency for dramatic cost savings - Decentralized storage integration - built on decentralized storage protocols incl. BNB Greenfield & Walrus ---Business model--- - AI as a utility – pay per FLOP (floating-point operation) for inference & training, anywhere, anytime. - Commoditize, tokenize, & trade FLOPs —the smallest, fully fungible unit of AI compute. ---Traction--- - 520 K+ DataAgent nodes: Contributed compute to power AI inference for data generation - 15 K+ ChatGPT users: Contributed 2.2 M+ real-user ChatGPT conversations—largest dataset outside OpenAI","links":"https://www.gata.xyz/","market_cap":930464,"market_cap_rank":3828,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gata/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x46ee3bfc281d59009ccd06f1dd6abdbfcd82ffc3","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x46ee3bfc281d59009ccd06f1dd6abdbfcd82ffc3"}},"is_native":false}
