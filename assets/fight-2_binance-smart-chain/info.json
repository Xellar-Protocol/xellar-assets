{"name":"FIGHT","id":"fight-2_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"$fight","description":"Fight is a licensed Web3 ecosystem that transforms global combat-sports fandom into digital ownership. Built on Solana, it operates under an official multi-year UFC partnership (2023–2028) through Concept Labs. The ecosystem runs on three pillars: Fight.ID (on-chain identity for fans and fighters), FP Points (non-transferable reputation system), and $FIGHT (utility/IP token for staking, governance, access, and rewards). Fans use $FIGHT to join fighter communities, participate in skill-based prediction markets, and access merch and ticketing. All ecosystem fees flow into a DAO treasury that funds buybacks, burns, and growth programs, creating a closed-loop economy that ties real engagement and UFC-backed experiences to token value and long-term sustainability.","links":"https://www.fight.foundation/","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/fight-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb2d97c4ed2d0ef452654f5cab3da3735b5e6f3ab","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xb2d97c4ed2d0ef452654f5cab3da3735b5e6f3ab"}},"is_native":false}
