{"name":"Solayer","id":"solayer_solana","symbol":"layer","description":"Solayer is developing InfiniSVM, a next-generation, hardware-accelerated blockchain network that can achieve unprecedented throughput, near-zero latency, and robust composability. InfiniSVM architecture leverages Infiniband RDMA for near-microsecond inter-node communication and advanced concurrency control strategies. It pushes blockchain performance to hardware limits, targeting 1M+ TPS and 100Gbps+ network bandwidth. This design provides a path for next-generation applications that require high throughput, low fees, and a seamless composable environment.","links":"https://solayer.org/network","market_cap":35815897,"market_cap_rank":794,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/solayer/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"LAYER4xPpTCb3QL8S9u41EAhAX7mhBn8Q6xMTwY2Yzc","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/LAYER4xPpTCb3QL8S9u41EAhAX7mhBn8Q6xMTwY2Yzc"}},"is_native":false}
