{"name":"Agentic Open Economy","id":"agentic-open-economy_base","symbol":"aoe","description":"An open, permissionless, and agentic economy - where intelligence, autonomy, and coordination converge. We build in the wild — across AI, crypto, and the evolving frontier of digital systems. Projects like the x402 Protocol are just the beginning: blueprints for how agents can create, trade, and collaborate without permission. \"Forward looking statement\" - We build products and infrastructures that generate value for AOE in open ecosystems. Potential examples are: 1. Agentic marketplaces where entities trade knowledge, labor, and compute. 2. Payment protocols for real-time, streaming, or micro-agent economies. 3. Digital frameworks that expand what’s possible when machines and humans co-create.","links":"http://aoe.oxbull.tech/","market_cap":1218433,"market_cap_rank":3514,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/agentic-open-economy_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x080212e31d4224e89bd94c1d5662452897741907","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x080212e31d4224e89bd94c1d5662452897741907"}},"is_native":false}
