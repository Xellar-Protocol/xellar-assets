{"name":"JAMBO","id":"jambo-2_solana","symbol":"jambo","description":"Jambo Exchange (JAMBO) is a meme-driven parody project on NEAR that presents itself as the “2nd centralized DEX.” It intentionally imitates TradFi-style custody and manual settlements as satire, not as a functional exchange. The JAMBO token was launched on meme.cooking and serves purely as a community-driven meme asset. It has no guaranteed utility or value, and users should treat it strictly as entertainment.","links":"https://jambo.meme.cooking","market_cap":1017465,"market_cap_rank":3728,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/jambo-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"2cMYUjUQJzrTcnxrD8JgL1BQL1AQKCtRkYLdmaTpCWYB","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/2cMYUjUQJzrTcnxrD8JgL1BQL1AQKCtRkYLdmaTpCWYB"}},"is_native":false}
