{"name":"SymVerse","id":"symverse-2","symbol":"symm","description":"SymVerse is a multi-blockchain platform ecosystem with 1-second block Finality that operates based on self-sovereign distributed ID. With a Symverse-based ID system, independent blockchain platforms can expand blockchain services as a cooperative ecosystem that interacts with one another. SymVerse predicts that a decentralized identifier (DID), capable of expressing the diverse economic activities and interconnectedness of various economic agents and objects within future social infrastructures, will be essential. In response, it introduced a new blockchain mainnet that operates with its own independent decentralized ID system. The SymVerse mainnet is currently the only blockchain operating based on decentralized ID.","links":"https://www.symverse.org/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/symverse-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":null}}}
