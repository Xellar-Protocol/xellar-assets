{"name":"BNB Tiger OG","id":"bnbtiger_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"bnbtigerog","description":"BNBTiger OG (also referred to as the CTO – Community Takeover) represents a rare case in decentralized finance: a project whose original developers attempted to abandon and replace it, only for the community to seize control and preserve its integrity. By examining provable on-chain data, this whitepaper outlines the real history of BNBTiger, exposes the failed migration attempt, and documents how the community successfully defended the original, immutable contract. This is not simply a story of survival — it is a demonstration of why true decentralization rests with communities, not developers.","links":"https://bnbtigerog.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bnbtiger_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xac68931b666e086e9de380cfdb0fb5704a35dc2d","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xac68931b666e086e9de380cfdb0fb5704a35dc2d"}},"is_native":false}
