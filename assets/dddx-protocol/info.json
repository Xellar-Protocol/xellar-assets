{"name":"DDDX Protocol","id":"dddx-protocol","symbol":"dddx","description":"\"The DDDX Protocol is a new decentralized exchange with dual AMM algorithm that supporting voting escrow tokenomics (veToken governance model). The protocol is implemented as a set of smart contracts, designed to maximum capital efficiency and incentivize fees instead of liquidity. DDDX protocol features low cost (0.01% fee for stable token exchanging), near 0 slippage for both uncorrelated or tightly correlated assets trading by using two different curve, and veToken governance model for liquidity providers and traders, thus establishes a new paradigm for liquidity incentives for other protocols: Hand over governance power to the community and let the community vote on the emission of tokens.\"","links":"https://dddx.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dddx-protocol/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x4b6ee8188d6df169e1071a7c96929640d61f144f"}}}
