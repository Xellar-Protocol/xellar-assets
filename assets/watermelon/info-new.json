Not only can it be freely traded on decentralized exchanges, but it can also be used to play a variety of games officially developed by the technical team. One such game is \"Rock Paper Scissors,\" where two players compete in the game, and the winner earns the WAT staked by the loser.

The technical team will continually launch new, interesting, and fair competitive games for everyone to win more WAT.","links":"https://watcoin.farm","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/watermelon/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"8nZZoqBYy13LcMiso4ZdNLRK8BpymJAbyfVdZ1RcEBAq"}}}
