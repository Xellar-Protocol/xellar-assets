XGC is not just another token; it represents the anticipated “god candle” that many believe will ignite when XRP breaks out of its long-standing market structure. This movement, shared by countless XRP enthusiasts, inspired the creation of XGC, a meme token designed to bring the community together and offer unique value in its own right. The name “GOD CANDLE” itself holds a symbolic place within the crypto world. In market terms, a “god candle” represents a significant breakout move — a candle on the chart so massive that it becomes a clear marker of strength and momentum.
