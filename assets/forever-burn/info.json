{"name":"Forever Burn","id":"forever-burn","symbol":"fburn","description":"UNDERSTANDING THE ETERNAL FLAME AND THE SHRINKING OF CIRCULATING SUPPLY We are introducing a new innovative feature to the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem. The super burn acts like a deflationary mechanism built within the contract that burns through the pooled tokens to raise the floor price & marketcap on every buy and sell transaction through the block chain and during specific burn events. The burning mechanism is not a rebase as it will leave the total supply and your supply as a holder intact and only burn through the pooled tokens.","links":"https://forever-burn.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/forever-burn/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x3b2cb8b2a9baf200142456c550a328e6c45c176b"}}}
