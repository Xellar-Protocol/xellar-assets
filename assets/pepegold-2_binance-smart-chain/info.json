{"name":"PEPEGOLD","id":"pepegold-2_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"peg","description":"About PEPEGOLD (PEG): PEPEGOLD (PEG) is a blockchain-based stablecoin fully backed by 1 gram of physical gold per token. Designed for financial integrity and real-world utility, PEG combines the enduring value of gold with the transparency of decentralized ledgers. Issuance is strictly matched to verified gold reserves, ensuring stability and trust. Operable across Ethereum and BNB chains, PEG enables seamless cross-border transactions, institutional-grade compliance, and integration with top exchanges and market aggregators. It represents a reliable bridge between traditional wealth and modern digital finance. Initial Supply: 100,000,000 PEG tokens are minted at launch. This initial issuance reflects the capped token supply offered to the market. As the PEPEGOLD mainnet launches and integrates with physical gold reserves, the total supply may expand in accordance with actual gold-backed collateral. The on-chain tokens, however, are initially limited to 100 million units, ensuring full transparency and reserve matching from inception.","links":"https://pepegold.net/","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pepegold-2_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc940a6746f8ffa8a9476c116030e5d4baded805a","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xc940a6746f8ffa8a9476c116030e5d4baded805a"}},"is_native":false}
