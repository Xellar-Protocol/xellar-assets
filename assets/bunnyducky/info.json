{"name":"BunnyDucky","id":"bunnyducky","symbol":"bud","description":"BunnyDucky is a platform that tokenizes DeFi strategies as yield-bearing tokens. Stable swap LP tokens from Mercurial and Saber can be converted to yield tokens through BunnyDucky. The deposited LP tokens will be staked in their respective farms to generate profits. The yield tokens can then be deposited in Parrot.FI to borrow the stablecoin PAI. Since the yield tokens increase in value, this makes the PAI debt self-repaying. The BunnyDucky vaults will aim to invest 100% of the deposited value, and allow users to withdraw at any time. PS: currently the Max Supply is uncapped. The \"\"Max Supply\"\" only allows numeric values, so a large number was entered as a placeholder.","links":"https://app.bunnyducky.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bunnyducky/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"BUD1144GGYwmMRFs4Whjfkom5UHqC9a8dZHPVvR2vfPx"}}}
