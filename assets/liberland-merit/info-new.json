{"name":"Liberland Merit","id":"liberland-merit","symbol":"llm","description":"The Free Republic of Liberland is a sovereign state located between Croatia and Serbia on the west bank of the Danube River. Its motto—“To live and let live”—is the foundation upon which we are building a nation that emphasizes personal and economic freedom by limiting government power to its basic minimum. LLM, or the Liberland merit, is the political token of Liberland, awarded for contributions to the nation's development. 5000 staked merits and passing a KYC-based E-Residency process allows one to claim citizenship. Citizens use LLM to vote in elections and referenda and participate in “citizen headcount vetos” of passed legislation. There will never be more than 70 million merits.","links":"https://liberland.org/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/liberland-merit/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":null}}}
