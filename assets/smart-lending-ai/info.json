{"name":"Smart Lending AI","id":"smart-lending-ai","symbol":"slai","description":"Smart Lending AI (SLAI) is a decentralized on-chain lending protocol that lets users lock approved tokens and instantly borrow up to 50% of their USD value in ETH—without selling. Prices are calculated directly on-chain via WETH pairs, and loan risk is managed through real-time volatility and liquidity analysis. Borrowers pay a flat 5% interest, while SLAI stakers (≥50,000 tokens) enjoy zero interest benefits. Designed for active DeFi traders, SLAI enables fast, gas-efficient liquidity access while preserving token exposure.","links":"https://smartlending.cloud/","market_cap":17781.71,"market_cap_rank":10123,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/smart-lending-ai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x72c440b5a41cd48e4c362c706e3f42000de1d8f7","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x72c440b5a41cd48e4c362c706e3f42000de1d8f7"}}}
