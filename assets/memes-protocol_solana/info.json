Each $MEMES agent thinks, adapts, and acts across digital spaces — autonomous, chaotic, and always online. What Is Memes Protocol? Memes Protocol is an AI-native framework where autonomous agents operate as meme-generating, trend-surfing entities. These agents aren’t just bots — they’re cultural instruments: - trained to detect online patterns - built to create or react to viral moments - able to operate independently or collaborate in swarms With $MEMES at its core, the protocol becomes a live ecosystem of evolving digital personalities.","links":"https://memesprotocol.xyz/","market_cap":5992.12,"market_cap_rank":12099,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/memes-protocol/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"6kjzL6NBtwhzdhZJASqHMimfaxNBGqKd2h6JHnnbRuao","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/6kjzL6NBtwhzdhZJASqHMimfaxNBGqKd2h6JHnnbRuao"}},"is_native":false}
