{"name":"Snake","id":"snake-5_solana","symbol":"snake","description":"The project is inspired by the classic mobile game Snake, which gained popularity on early-generation phones. The concept revolves around a simple but addictive gameplay mechanic where players control a snake that grows longer as it consumes items, while avoiding collisions with itself and the boundaries. This project revives the nostalgia of the original Snake game while reintroducing it to a modern audience in a new format. Its purpose is to combine familiar retro-style gaming with updated accessibility, community engagement, and potential integrations in the digital space. By leveraging the timeless appeal of Snake, the project aims to create a fun, recognizable, and interactive experience that resonates with both older players who remember the original game and newer generations discovering it for the first time.","links":"https://snakeog.com/","market_cap":5495.51,"market_cap_rank":12227,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/snake-5/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"8D9CZBsMocuJ8bdnpegGE8auHdFQ1Ez5F66wWAFv3WcN","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/8D9CZBsMocuJ8bdnpegGE8auHdFQ1Ez5F66wWAFv3WcN"}},"is_native":false}
