{"name":"Golden Bailey","id":"golden-bailey","symbol":"bailey","description":"$Bailey is the token for Bailey! The real dog made famous with the \"I have no idea what I am doing\" meme. She is an early internet culture meme that garnered millions of likes across reddit, Instagram, and imgur. Now with the support of her owner (and photographer) we have brought her back for all to enjoy and participate in her many memes of a cute dog trying to make it in the human world! Bailey is known for being silly, fiercely loyal, and a cuddler. Every now and then when she gets really silly she is even known to be a bit redneck and redneck retriever is one of her most popular alter egos.","links":"https://basedbailey.com/","market_cap":485742,"market_cap_rank":4567,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/golden-bailey/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x3942cae8bb9fc8f24fe627b30b6e7461e5662ba7"}}}
