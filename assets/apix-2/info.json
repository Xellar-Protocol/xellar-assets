{"name":"APIX","id":"apix-2","symbol":"apix","description":"APIX is a utility token powering AvaxPixel — a decentralized, real-time pixel-art canvas on the Avalanche blockchain. Users spend APIX to paint, overwrite, and defend pixels, turning digital expression into a competitive, collaborative game. A dynamic pricing algorithm governs pixel costs, while active contributors are rewarded through a Personal Paint Score (PPS) that determines token airdrops and leaderboard rankings. APIX creates a self-sustaining art economy where creativity, community engagement, and strategy directly translate into token utility and social recognition. With no pre-sale, no VC involvement, and a strong referral system, APIX aims to become the cultural engine of Web3 art, activism, and memetic expression.","links":"https://www.avaxpixel.com/","market_cap":1016011,"market_cap_rank":4135,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/apix-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"avalanche":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x1edf79e77693561e80072becbcce1e16dc356aca","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/avax/tokens/0x1edf79e77693561e80072becbcce1e16dc356aca"}}}
