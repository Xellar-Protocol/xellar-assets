{"name":"BeaRex","id":"bearex","symbol":"brex","description":"What’s the Big Idea? We envision BeaRex as an umbrella brand that encompasses both classic and crypto-related businesses. There are four key areas in total. Classic Business: 1. An animated TV series for adults that will be distributed on world-leading streaming platforms. 2. Licensed products such as the BeaRex robot plushies, merchandise and more. Crypto-related business: 1. A seasonal Play-and-Earn game that has both 2D and 3D versions. 2. An educational metaverse where users will learn how to make their own BeaRex animations. These ‘para-series’, created by the community, will form a separate BeaRex season. The token liquidity pool will acquire 30% of the profits from the sale of licensed products and the animated series. BeaRex’s capitalization will encompass copyrights, licensing and related game services. In this way, the token will continually grow in value and receive additional liquidity from the success of products such as toys.","links":"https://bearex.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bearex/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
