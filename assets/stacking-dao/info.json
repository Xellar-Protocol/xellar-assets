{"name":"Stacking DAO","id":"stacking-dao","symbol":"ststx","description":"Stacking DAO is a Liquid Stacking protocol that gives users an auto-compounding tokenized representation of stacked STX (stSTX). Stacking on the Stacks network can be complex, given that solo Stacking requires running a node and locking a minimum of ~90,000 STX. Moreover, Stacked tokens are locked for 2 weeks cycles even if performed via a community pool. Stacking DAO eliminates these issues through liquid stacking, and stSTX is already integrated with most DeFi apps in the Stacks ecosystem, unlocking more liquidity for the whole ecosystem.","links":"https://www.stackingdao.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/stacking-dao/logo.png","detail_platform":{"stacks":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"SP4SZE494VC2YC5JYG7AYFQ44F5Q4PYV7DVMDPBG.ststx-token"}}}
