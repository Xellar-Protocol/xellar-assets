{"name":"Garbi Protocol","id":"garbi-protocol","symbol":"grb","description":"Garbi Protocol is the first decentralized exchange for stablecoins that uses an automated market maker to manage liquidity on Arbitrum. Users can experience the seamless integration of trading, reward harvesting, and asset cultivation all within a single decentralized platform, powered by the collective efforts of a vibrant community. The Garbi Protocol had a successful presale on Pandasale 50 days ago with a small market cap and has been growing non-stop since then. Now, the protocol is set to launch its 2.0 version in the next few weeks, which will bring many upgrades for users. The new version includes deep integration with Chainlink to provide users with the best rates on stablecoin swaps. The Garbi Protocol is governed by a decentralized assembly of GRB token holders who propose and cast votes on modifications to the protocol through a democratic process.","links":"https://garbi.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/garbi-protocol/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x5fd71280b6385157b291b9962f22153fc9e79000"}}}
