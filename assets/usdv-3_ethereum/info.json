{"name":"USDV","id":"usdv-3_ethereum","symbol":"usdv","description":"The project leverages blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to capitalize on arbitrage and market inefficiencies. This is a delta-neutral stablecoin project. The trading system generates returns from the basis trade and perp to perp funding rate arbitrage as well as crypto market inefficiencies. Customers mint USDV stablecoin and VLP token. They then stake USDV on our platform to generate a yield. The tokens generate yield in 2 different ways. USDV is a stablecoin so it is fully redeemable for USDC and yield is generated by minting more tokens from the trading profits. VLP token is a risk-on asset. Its price fluctuates according to the PnL of the trading system.","links":"https://usdv.one/","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/usdv-3/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x05a275ed9edf4378ac54928379ee6bc6e8900e4c"}},"is_native":false}
