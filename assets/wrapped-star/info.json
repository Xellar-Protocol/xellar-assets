{"name":"Wrapped Star","id":"wrapped-star","symbol":"wstr","description":"Urbit is a technology stack for sovereign computing broken into two components: Urbit OS and Urbit ID. Urbit OS is a clean-slate P2P virtual operating system that you can own cryptographically through Urbit ID. Urbit ID (aka Azimuth: https://github.com/urbit/azimuth) is broken into three tiers of NFT: Galaxies, Stars, and Planets. Galaxies are for governance of the Urbit network; Stars are the primary economic vehicle; Planets are for individual Urbit users to use the network. Since Stars are NFTs, they're not well-suited to providing a liquid market â€” Wrapped Star (WSTR) gets around this by providing a contract whereby a star owner can deposit a ERC-721 and receive back a single ERC-20 representing a \"wrapped\" star.
