{"name":"Omnity Convertible Token","id":"octopus-network_ethereum","symbol":"oct","description":"Omnity Network is a Bitcoin-native interoperability and programmability protocol designed to enhance Bitcoin’s utility in decentralized finance (BTCFi). By leveraging cross-chain functionality through the Omnity Hub, it facilitates seamless asset transfers between Bitcoin and other major blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and ICP, all while maintaining Bitcoin’s full node-level security. Omnity also introduces the **Runes Indexer, the first fully on-chain Bitcoin asset indexer, which supports emerging BTCFi use cases such as lending, yield farming, and tokenized digital art. The Runes Exchange Environment (REE) provides a decentralized, Turing-complete smart contract execution environment, enabling Bitcoin-native composability for DeFi protocols without altering Bitcoin’s core consensus. Omnity’s ecosystem is governed through the \\$OT token, enabling community-driven decision-making through an SNS DAO on the Internet Computer protocol. With the launch of RichSwap, an open-source, non-custodial AMM DEX, Omnity offers a comprehensive infrastructure for building and scaling Bitcoin-based decentralized finance applications.","links":"https://www.omnity.network/","market_cap":3027206,"market_cap_rank":2539,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/octopus-network_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf5cfbc74057c610c8ef151a439252680ac68c6dc","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xf5cfbc74057c610c8ef151a439252680ac68c6dc"}},"is_native":false}
