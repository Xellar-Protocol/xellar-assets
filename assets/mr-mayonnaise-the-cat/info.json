{"name":"Mr Mayonnaise the Cat","id":"mr-mayonnaise-the-cat","symbol":"mayo","description":"Mr. Mayonnaise the Cat is here to pounce on the crypto scene, turning a simple feline crisis into a full-blown movement. MAYO is a community-driven token inspired by Mr. Mayonnaise, a beloved neighborhood cat who went through a wild vet bill escapade after a tick bite that cost as much as a small car. With MAYO, we’re rallying behind a cause: if a tick bite can rack up such a bill, then Mr. Mayonnaise deserves his own currency. This isn’t just a token; it’s a mission to support pet owners everywhere who feel the sting of hefty vet bills and want to have a little fun in the process. Powered by a passionate community, MAYO rewards holders with exciting perks, community-driven charity donations, and, of course, a chance to be part of a purrfectly unpredictable adventure. Join us as we build MAYO, one meow at a time.","links":"https://mayosol.com/","market_cap":241865,"market_cap_rank":5273,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mr-mayonnaise-the-cat/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"81GRrR2oudSsxTajwxGsfqcW88FaC4Q1Xx4HKfGipump"}}}
