{"name":"Tickr","id":"tickr","symbol":"tickr","description":"Tickr is a revolutionary new app that utilizes Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to extract valuable insights from token names. Despite the abundance of apps and websites that offer analytical data on token price, liquidity, and market capitalization, financial service providers have neglected the most basic piece of information of all: the token's name. Tickr solves this problem by providing a comprehensive analysis of new tokens based on their names or tickers. Utilizing NLP (Natural Language Processing), the app provides a user-friendly approach for identifying potential successes and failures, recognizing patterns, tracking trends, and detecting scams. Drawing on extensive experience in crypto investment, our team has created a custom platform that guides you in making informed decisions by providing simplified visuals, and critical information that is beneficial for both investors and token holders. The platform helps you to identify which tokens to follow and which to avoid.","links":"https://www.tickr.tech","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/tickr/logo.png"}
