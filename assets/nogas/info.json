{"name":"NoGas","id":"nogas","symbol":"ngs","description":"What is NoGas? NoGas is a first of its kind innovator in integrating paymasters infrastructure within its smart contract. NoGas allows a third party to cover your gas payments so you don’t have to! What is a Paymaster? Paymasters serve as smart contract accounts that sponsor transactions, enabling third-party mechanisms to cover transaction costs. This is critical in that it liberates users from the necessity of holding the native blockchain token (in most cases ETH). This is a recent upgrade in Ethereum’s functionality EIP 4337. How does it work? The paymaster is funded primarily via a percentage of taxes. NoGas also uses a mint & swap mechanic that is automated to periodically sell based on various smart contract parameters which aids in funding the paymaster. This mechanism won’t be activated at the start of the project.","links":"https://www.nogas.tech/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nogas/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x93999d3fcab15cc052cf96b739580fc11e015944"}}}
