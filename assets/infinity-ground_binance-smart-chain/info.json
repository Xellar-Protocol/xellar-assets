{"name":"Infinity Ground","id":"infinity-ground_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"ain","description":"Infinity Ground aims to be the leading blockchain infrastructure for Vibe Coders, enabling anyone to build and own decentralized applications through natural language and agent collaboration. We envision a future where software is no longer written line-by-line, but co-created with AI agents in a fully decentralized, censorship-resistant environment. Through our Agentic IDE, AI App Store, and ING Network, we are building a new internet native to creativity, autonomy, and collective intelligence. Infinity Ground’s current core product is the First Decentralized Agentic IDE—a revolutionary development platform powered by AI agents. Users can describe what they want to build in natural language, and the system generates fully functional DApps without requiring any coding knowledge. The IDE supports instant deployment, a growing library of customizable templates, and smooth integration with our AI App Store for publishing and monetization. This is not just a builder—it’s the beginning of a new creative economy driven by agentic collaboration.","links":"https://www.infinityg.ai/","market_cap":9306145,"market_cap_rank":1615,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/infinity-ground_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x9558a9254890b2a8b057a789f413631b9084f4a3","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x9558a9254890b2a8b057a789f413631b9084f4a3"}},"is_native":false}
