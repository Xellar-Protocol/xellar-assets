{"name":"KAKA","id":"kaka_solana","symbol":"kaka","description":"What is Kaka? • A community-driven meme token built on Solana, born from chaos, raised by internet lore. • Not a utility token. Not a security. Just pure, unfiltered vibes and violence (the legal kind). • Your ticket to the most ungovernable forest in crypto. 🔥 Why Kaka? Because sometimes you don’t need a roadmap — you need a raccoon with a flare gun, a dream, and zero impulse control. Kaka is for the misfits, the banned park-goers, and everyone who’s ever screamed at a leaf. 🛠️ Built on Solana Fast, cheap, and ideal for launching deranged experiments with actual scalability. Kaka moves at the speed of forest drama.","links":"https://www.kakasol.com/","market_cap":25831,"market_cap_rank":9283,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kaka/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"FH6jc68WzeAUXKp6uDg9QPciTeU75o32xFDzKLzmbonk","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/FH6jc68WzeAUXKp6uDg9QPciTeU75o32xFDzKLzmbonk"}},"is_native":false}
