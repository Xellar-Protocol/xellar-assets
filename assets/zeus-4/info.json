{"name":"Zeus","id":"zeus-4","symbol":"zeus","description":"$ZEUS — The God of Meme Coins Has Arrived Bored of Olympus and disillusioned by the stale state of meme coins, Zeus descended from the heavens, striking the Ethereum blockchain with thunder and fury. Reborn as a dog with divine energy, he brings chaos, charisma, and unstoppable momentum to the crypto world. $ZEUS isn’t just another meme coin — it’s a symbol of power, rebellion, and fun. Backed by the raw might of the god of thunder himself, it channels ancient myth into modern markets. Forged on Ethereum. Fueled by lightning. Destined to rule. Welcome to the era of $ZEUS — where legends meme themselves into history.","links":"https://www.truezeuscoin.com/","market_cap":895175,"market_cap_rank":4328,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/zeus-4/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x4d4574f50dd8b9dbe623cf329dcc78d76935e610","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x4d4574f50dd8b9dbe623cf329dcc78d76935e610"}}}
