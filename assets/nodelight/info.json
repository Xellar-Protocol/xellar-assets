{"name":"Nodelight","id":"nodelight","symbol":"nodl","description":"Nodelight Solutions is a long-term, on-chain enterprise, designed to build and maintain a modular ecosystem of DeAI-driven utilities for real-time blockchain insight. We’re not here to throw dashboards at users. We’re building DeAI agents that live where users already are: Telegram, X, and other platforms. The aim is to deliver useful insight with no friction, no setup, and no barrier to action. Just instant actionable data. We focus on context, not clutter. Our tools interpret patterns, track behavioral shifts, and offer clarity with one goal in mind: helping users spot what matters and act when it counts. Our mission is to build a reliable backbone of tools that serve different actors in the blockchain space. Some utilities will cater directly to DeFi traders and narrative trackers; others will serve analysts, builders, or market participants seeking macro understanding and structural insights. In a landscape flooded with raw data, we aim to deliver clarity, usability, and impact, empowering users with real-time context that translates directly into value.","links":"https://nodelight.tech/","market_cap":16251.61,"market_cap_rank":10264,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nodelight/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x63a4faa0edc59811f9d3fd8b9aae5131a9488437","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x63a4faa0edc59811f9d3fd8b9aae5131a9488437"}}}
