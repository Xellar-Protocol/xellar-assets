{"name":"KURUMI","id":"kurumi_ethereum","symbol":"ku-chan","description":"Ku-Chan | Kurumi is a community-driven token inspired by the true story of a spirited white Shiba Inu rescued from the Chiba Wan Dog Shelter in Japan — the same shelter where Cocoro and Neiro once found hope. Under the gentle care of riko.wako.mama, Ku-Chan’s journey continues a lineage of compassion and rescue that began with Kabosumama and the original Doge. The project celebrates real stories of second chances and the bonds between rescued animals and the people who care for them, serving as a tribute to community, kindness, and connection within the broader Shiba-inspired ecosystem.","links":"https://kabochan.blog.jp/archives/54646699.html","market_cap":12427.44,"market_cap_rank":10733,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kurumi/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x341ea9d0e5c9a2a7781aff398117846ea2fff2ab","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x341ea9d0e5c9a2a7781aff398117846ea2fff2ab"}},"is_native":false}
