{"name":"Warp Cash","id":"warp-cash","symbol":"warp","description":"Warp is a fully decentralized non-custodial protocol allowing private transactions in the crypto-space. As a decentralized protocol, Warp smart contracts have been implemented within the BNB Smart Chain, making them immutable. They can neither be changed nor tampered with. Therefore, nobody - including the original developers - can modify or shut them down. All governance and mining smart contracts are deployed by the community in a decentralized manner. As a non-custodial protocol, users keep custody of their cryptocurrencies while operating Warp. This means that at each deposit, they are provided with the private key enabling the access to the deposited funds, which gives users complete control over their assets.","links":"https://warpcash.app/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/warp-cash/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x5dcc2cfcaf202a9373005fa65905a7169c6c53d5"}}}
