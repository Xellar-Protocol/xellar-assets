{"name":"Rage Guy","id":"rage-guy_solana","symbol":"rageguy","description":"Rageguy refers to the main character of a series of crudely-drawn comics typically consisting of four panes, portraying situations that can bring rage and exasperation, with the main character screaming with anger as a result. Due to its simplicity and exploitability, Rageguy has been proven popular thus being evolved into a comic series now known as Rage Comics. The first instance of Rageguy came in 2008 on the 4chan /b/ imageboard. The image consisted of a 4-pane comic made in MS Paint, portraying the \"toilet splashback\" experience. The first three panes described the incidence, and in the fourth pane, a drawing of Rageguy screaming appeared with a caption saying \"FFFFFFUUUUUUUUUU-\" on the right of the face in red letters.","links":"https://rageguy.meme/","market_cap":184826,"market_cap_rank":6017,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/rage-guy_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"GvV7sFu6FHJsSVXfpG7xqFnWar3c7YkcC74rqe7Bpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/GvV7sFu6FHJsSVXfpG7xqFnWar3c7YkcC74rqe7Bpump"}},"is_native":false}
