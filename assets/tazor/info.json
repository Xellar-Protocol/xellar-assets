{"name":"Tazor","id":"tazor","symbol":"tazor","description":"Tazor is the first ever DEFI protocol that allows users to control their APR individually and separately from other users! Imagine Tazor is a Savings Account that allows you to determine the APR that you receive on your account. Tazor protocol relies on a 2 token system. The TAZOR token (the main protocol token) does not have to be sold to realize profits. Instead, the TAZ token (protocol reward token) can be sold to realize profits. However, TAZ (the reward token) controls the APR that your staked TAZOR receives! So the protocol’s reward token has the BEST USE CASE EVER! The more TAZ you stake, the higher your APR goes up on your staked TAZOR, to unlimited levels! The protocol also allows other DEFI projects to use their tokens to buy TAZOR at a discount in an effort to help the entire DEFI community on many EVM compatible blockchains. We truly believe that our DEFI protocol is revolutionary. It may be the 1st ever protocol that allows for very high APR’s, but is also sustainable because users have to earn or buy their way to a high APR using our 2 token system.","links":"https://tazor.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/tazor/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xee65d8b88f86ace0f7ba42ba2d2c679b6f604bf0"},"avalanche":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xee65d8b88f86ace0f7ba42ba2d2c679b6f604bf0"},"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xee65d8b88f86ace0f7ba42ba2d2c679b6f604bf0"},"fantom":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xee65d8b88f86ace0f7ba42ba2d2c679b6f604bf0"}}}
