{"name":"Arken World","id":"arken-world_solana","symbol":"ark","description":"Arken World is a blockchain-based strategy game that combines idle mechanics with world-building and community-driven events. Players construct and upgrade buildings, generate resources, and expand their influence within a persistent digital city. The ecosystem is powered by the $ARK token, which serves as the medium for upgrades, governance, and in-game activities. Arken World is designed as a long-term universe that evolves with new content, faction conflicts, and lore-based activations, offering both gameplay utility and a foundation for broader integrations in the Solana ecosystem.","links":"https://www.arken.world","market_cap":3807.4,"market_cap_rank":12719,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/arken-world_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"Cph1zxsCUz18v6aa2hiUYwfVkSV7BSFHmCaJLqQspump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/Cph1zxsCUz18v6aa2hiUYwfVkSV7BSFHmCaJLqQspump"}},"is_native":false}
