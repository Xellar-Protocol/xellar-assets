We enable every person with a cell phone to be able to experience, learn, and use digital currency, distributing wealth while projecting return for social investors. GoodDollar is generating a sustainable-by-design UBI economy, by the issuance of a reserve-backed cryptocurrency (G$) with supply policies is based on the AMM Bancor Formula, which sets the G$ price (according to a reserve ratio policy) and generates the supply that is demanded by buyers, holders, G$ merchants and liquidity providers, as it also enables them to cash back from the reserve according to the same contract policies. GoodDollar is designed to generate a sustainable Universal Basic Income for all, by socially incentivizing DeFi investors to stake part of their portfolio into GoodDollar Trust Funds, a set of smart contracts that aggregates the yield generated by having deposit the supporters money in third party DeFi protocols (Compound, Aaveâ€¦), feed it into GoodDollar Reserve contract and socially optimize the usage of that money by generating G$s and distribute it equally to all (unique humans) UBI claimers. This way we asure that UBI is generated and backed by real value instead of just coin inflation.\"","links":"https://www.gooddollar.org/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gooddollar/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":2,"contract_address":"0x67c5870b4a41d4ebef24d2456547a03f1f3e094b"},"fuse":{"decimal_place":2,"contract_address":"0x495d133b938596c9984d462f007b676bdc57ecec"},"celo":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x62b8b11039fcfe5ab0c56e502b1c372a3d2a9c7a"}}}
