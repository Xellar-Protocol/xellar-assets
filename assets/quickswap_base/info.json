Launched in 2020, the platform hit a peak TVL of over $1.5 billion and has amassed hundreds of billions in lifetime volume. Users can swap, LP, farm, trade decentralised perpetuals, stake, and more - all in 1 tab. $QUICK (New) is QuickSwap's native token & redenominated in 2022 at a 1:1000 ratio from the $QUICK (OLD) token (via a token split). $QUICK is also the platform's ecosystem token that can be used for staking, governance, and more. QuickSwap has an ongoing buyback and burn mechanism helps drive token scarcity, derived from protocol revenue.","links":"https://quickswap.exchange/","market_cap":7467326,"market_cap_rank":1780,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/quickswap/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x7094c27f342dbadfbbed005b219431595e33b305","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x7094c27f342dbadfbbed005b219431595e33b305"}},"is_native":false}
