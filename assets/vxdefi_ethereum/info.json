{"name":"vXDEFI","id":"vxdefi_ethereum","symbol":"vxdefi","description":"Please note that the vXDEFI token is connected to the XDEFI token (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/xdefi ) and so the information for the above 5 questions can be taken from there: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/xdefi XDEFI token holders are able to stake their XDEFI tokens and when they do, they receive vXDEFI in exchange, which is a transferable and fungible token. So, for every 1 XDEFI token staked, the staker receives 1 vXDEFI token in return. vXDEFI represents the staker’s percentage ownership of the entire vault receiving the rewards in XDEFI coming from the fees collected by XDEFI. There is no lock-up period and rewards will auto-compound until stakers decide to convert their vXDEFI back into XDEFI tokens. vXDEFI tokens can also be used to vote on XDEFI community proposals via Snapshot.","links":"https://xdefi.io/","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/vxdefi_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe1a3864dbf62fb94834b108ff6bf439ce70183ac"}},"is_native":false}
