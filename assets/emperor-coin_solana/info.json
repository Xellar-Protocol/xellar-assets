{"name":"Emperor Coin","id":"emperor-coin_solana","symbol":"$imperium","description":"Emperor Coin ($IMPERIUM) has experienced strong initial traction through an active and growing community. Within the first weeks of launch, the project has attracted over 10,000 followers on X (Twitter) and more than 1,600 active community members across social platforms. The presale was hosted on PinkSale and successfully reached its hard cap, establishing a starting liquidity pool of approximately $30,000 on Raydium. Strategic partnerships are currently being developed with several market-making firms to sustain a daily trading volume target of $50,000+ and strengthen chart stability. The project has also initiated collaborations with select KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders) to expand market reach and community engagement. Emperor Coin has released its first MVP: the $IMPERIUM token and NFT ecosystem, including the \"50 Emperors\" NFT collection, which grants holders governance and VIP access. The NFTs are already listed on Solsea. Upcoming milestones include listings on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap, integration with TradingView charts, and the launch of exclusive holder events, starting with Dubai. The team’s focus is on creating strong brand presence, building liquidity depth, and driving adoption through community rewards, giveaways, and strategic marketing campaigns.
