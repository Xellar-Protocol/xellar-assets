{"name":"JimmyBoss Collective","id":"jimmyboss-collective_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"jbc","description":"JimmyBoss Collective (JBC) is a Web3-based digital ecosystem designed to transform user participation into measurable on-chain value. The project focuses on task-based engagement, referral-driven growth, and verified user activity through its upcoming LaunchGate platform. Users are expected to earn rewards by completing predefined actions such as content interaction, community participation, and ecosystem contributions. JBC operates on the BNB Smart Chain and aims to combine decentralized token utility with a centralized application layer that manages rewards, verification, and user progression. The ecosystem is structured to support long-term platform sustainability through utility-based token usage rather than speculative mechanisms alone.","links":"https://www.jbc.finance/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/jimmyboss-collective_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa9cc0d38e57dbec771d7eacd133d509e40cb6473","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xa9cc0d38e57dbec771d7eacd133d509e40cb6473"}},"is_native":false}
