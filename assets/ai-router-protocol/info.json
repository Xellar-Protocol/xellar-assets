{"name":"Ai Router Protocol","id":"ai-router-protocol","symbol":"$air","description":"The way we move information is evolving. With the rapid rise of decentralized applications (dApps), blockchain ecosystems, and the Internet of Things (IoT), the traditional models of data communication are falling short. Centralized systems, although foundational to the internet’s early infrastructure, are proving inadequate when it comes to resilience, privacy, and scalability in an interconnected and decentralized world. AIRouter Protocol enters this landscape as a Layer-1 communication layer designed to solve these fundamental problems. It is built on the high-performance Sui blockchain and enables decentralized, real-time communication between devices, applications, and infrastructure with enhanced security, speed, and autonomy. AIRouter replaces centralized gateways with an intelligent, permissionless node mesh that allows any application, service, or device to securely interact without relying on third parties. AIRouter is purpose-built for IoT networks, DePIN projects, cross-chain dApps, and emerging edge computing environments. Whether you're operating smart infrastructure, coordinating logistics, building interactive games, or managing financial protocols, AIRouter provides a foundational communication stack to support your decentralized operations.","links":"https://airouterprotocol.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ai-router-protocol/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
