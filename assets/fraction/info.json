{"name":"Fraction","id":"fraction","symbol":"fraction","description":"FRACTION is a native streamable token on the xDai Chain with a total supply of only 1. Which means you can ever only own a fraction of the token. The inital value of 1 FRACTION got set to 2000$ by filling up the FRACTION:WXDAI Honeyswap Liquidity pool on a 0.5:1000 ratio. It's a native Supertoken, meaning you can stream it via the Superfluid protocol. The price solely depends on buy:sale:liquidity-pool ratio on the Honeyswap DEX (there was no Airdrop, Airstream, ICO, IDO or any other crypto-acronym). The token doesn't have ANY real-life value/usecase - it's more like a \"collectible you can trade like a currency\" than a utility token.","links":"https://fraction.fyi/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/fraction/logo.png","detail_platform":{"xdai":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x2bf2ba13735160624a0feae98f6ac8f70885ea61"}}}
