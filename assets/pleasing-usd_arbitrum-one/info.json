{"name":"Pleasing USD","id":"pleasing-usd_arbitrum-one","symbol":"pusd","description":"Pleasing Golden is an RWA platform that transforms precious metals into liquid, yield-generating tokens accessible to anyone, anywhere. Pleasing Golden’s vision is to make gold ownership open, liquid, and collaborative. Through tokenization and a suite of liquidity-sharing programs—including DeFi liquidity leasing and Tokenization-as-a-Service—the brand transforms slow, closed markets into dynamic, programmable assets that can circulate instantly among builders, traders, and holders. PUSD is Pleasing Golden’s synthetic stablecoin connecting on-chain liquidity with the physical gold ecosystem. Backed by a hybrid reserve of USDT collateral and tokenized metal exposure, PUSD enables real-time financing and settlement throughout the network. The model connects: - Depositors — deposit USDT, receive PUSD, and stake it into sPUSD for yield. - Investors — traders or asset managers seeking stable liquidity with gold-linked returns. - Operators — metals participants using PUSD to unlock working capital and accelerate settlement.","links":"https://www.pleasinggold.com/","market_cap":120280184,"market_cap_rank":371,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pleasing-usd_arbitrum-one/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc8fb643d18f1e53698cfda5c8fdf0cdc03c1dbec","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/arbitrum/tokens/0xc8fb643d18f1e53698cfda5c8fdf0cdc03c1dbec"}},"is_native":false}
