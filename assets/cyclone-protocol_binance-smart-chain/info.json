{"name":"Cyclone Protocol","id":"cyclone-protocol_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"cyc","description":"Cyclone is a multi-chain, non-custodial, privacy-preserving protocol. Cyclone applies zkSNARKs to enable transactional privacy by breaking the on-chain link between depositor and recipient addresses. It uses a smart contract that accepts coins/tokens deposits, which can be withdrawn by a different address. Whenever an asset is withdrawn from Cyclone, there is no way to link the withdrawal to the deposit for absolute privacy.","links":"https://cyclone.xyz/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cyclone-protocol/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x810ee35443639348adbbc467b33310d2ab43c168","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x810ee35443639348adbbc467b33310d2ab43c168"}},"is_native":false}
