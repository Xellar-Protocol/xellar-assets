{"name":"Binance ETH staking","id":"binance-eth_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"beth","description":"BETH is a tokenized asset representing Binance user's staked ETH at a 1:1 ratio, with Binance distributing staking benefits in the form of BETH on a daily basis. During the lock-up period, which may take 2 years or even longer, users will not be able to redeem their ETH. As such, Binance have launched the BETH/ETH trading pair as our solution to this liquidity problem. When ETH 2.0 goes live, users will be able to swap their ETH back based on their BETH holdings.","links":"https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/beacon-chain/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/binance-eth/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x250632378e573c6be1ac2f97fcdf00515d0aa91b","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x250632378e573c6be1ac2f97fcdf00515d0aa91b"}},"is_native":false}
