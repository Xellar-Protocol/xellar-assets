{"name":"Drive Crypto","id":"drive-crypto","symbol":"drivecrypto","description":"DRIVE CRYPTO is the first web3 mobility app developed based on DRIVE TO EARN concept gathering GameFI/SocialFi. It has been built around an essential daily task for most of the people: using a vehicle to move from one place to another. We are the first crypto space project which effectively bring to life a concept of mobility and functional gain. The users can fit themselves with Cars' NFTS - electric cars and Batteries' NFTS - electric power that calculate each distance driven whether km or mile. By this calculation, users will get theirs rewards in DrivePoints (internal token) - which can be used in game or transferred to their wallets. Each Car NTF is unique and rare as they are one edition only and there won't be two of a kind. In this way, we expect a great price appreciation on Cars NFTs. Cars NFT can be used not only on DRIVE2EARN APP but also on Racing GameFi mode, competing with other users and players - in 'need for speed' way. Best three racers will get rewards on $DriveCrypto. All the Cars' NFTs owners will be able to sell them on the first exclusive and car's only marketplace - NFT-DriveStore. DRIVE CRYPTO also is willing to be a contributor on needed infrastructure to meet the electric cars energy demand - in this way, part of the project profits will be used on the charging stations installs - in order to diminish climate changes impacts as well as Carbon Credits generation. DRIVE CRYPTO goes beyond and above a GameFi/SocialFi project - we are here to change environmental mindset through a long term web3 ecosystem.","links":"https://drivecrypto.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/drive-crypto/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa151f5d8d9558c85a70cd556e265a874073159fb"}}}
