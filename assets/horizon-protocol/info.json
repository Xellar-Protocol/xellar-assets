{"name":"Horizon Protocol","id":"horizon-protocol","symbol":"hzn","description":"Horizon Protocol is a new DeFi platform that facilitates the on-chain trading of synthetic assets that represent the real economy. Horizon Protocol seeks to provide exposure to real-world assets risk/return profiles via smart contracts on the blockchain. Horizon Protocol will bring interoperability, scalability and a whole new array of tradable, real-world derivative products to the DeFi ecosystem. Horizon Protocolâ€™s commitment to the Binance ecosystem and native implementation on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) offers users the speed and dependability that is currently lacking on the Ethereum blockchain. The Horizon Protocol token (HZN) drives the economic incentives for participants in the Horizon Protocol. HZN serves as collateral as part of the synthesis of tradable synthetic assets (zAssets), drives the reward system, as well as eventually facilitates a DAO that will govern the overall protocol and future development. Horizon Protocol is able to build upon the progress pioneered by others, while focusing on solving challenges related to scalability and affordability.","links":"https://horizonprotocol.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/horizon-protocol/logo.png"}
