{"name":"Tralalero Tralala","id":"tralalero-tralala_solana","symbol":"tralalero","description":"Tralalero Tralala is a community-powered memecoin on the Solana blockchain, inspired by the legendary shark Tralalero Tralala, known for his unmatched style, three shoes, and vibes louder than a conch shell on a Miami beach. Tralalero isn’t just a token — it’s a movement fueled by memes, creativity, and the irreverent spirit of the internet, pushed further by the Italian brain rot movement. For all we know, Tralalero may become Nike's new mascot.","links":"https://tralalero.webby.fun/","market_cap":104122,"market_cap_rank":6900,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/tralalero-tralala/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"8Y5Biziz3njt9NWc38cJuL76pdfyrvX6SnjtFPeDpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/8Y5Biziz3njt9NWc38cJuL76pdfyrvX6SnjtFPeDpump"}},"is_native":false}
