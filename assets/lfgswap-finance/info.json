{"name":"LFGSwap Finance","id":"lfgswap-finance","symbol":"lfg","description":"LFGSwap is a community-driven organization built to solve what might be called the “liquidity problem.” One could define this problem as the inability of disparate forms of liquidity to connect with markets in a decentralized way, and vice versa. While other solutions provide incrementally progressive advances toward solving the problem of liquidity, LFGSwap’s progress is intended to create a broader range of network effects. Rather than limiting itself to a single solution, LFGSwap intertwines many decentralized markets and instruments.","links":"https://app.lfgswap.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/lfgswap-finance/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereumpow":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xfd483e333cbe8fe7a418d9398d6bb81cc2b8e07b"}}}
