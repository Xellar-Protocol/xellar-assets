{"name":"Make Fun","id":"make-fun_base","symbol":"mf","description":"This project has been created in an effort to repay victims of the Sonne Finance exploit that happened in May of 2024. Make.Fun is a launchpad which can permissionlessly create tokens with any amount of liquidity at any arbitrary valuation using a liquidity AMO system. Its native token, called $MF, will be the very first token launched with the new liquidity primitive, with 100% of its supply minted to an Aerodrome LP. There are no team tokens, no investors, and no pre-sale.","links":"https://www.make.fun/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/make-fun_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x474cb5b5087e13ea006e13702e330c93c825ab5d","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x474cb5b5087e13ea006e13702e330c93c825ab5d"}},"is_native":false}
