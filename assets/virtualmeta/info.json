{"name":"Virtual Meta","id":"virtualmeta","symbol":"vma","description":"VMA is a token of Virtual meta, a multibus platform project that serves as a 'bridge' that integrates various metaversees into one. One of the most exciting features of the VMA platform is the ability for users (creators, players, brands, artists) to mint their own token. Meta Channel features VMA as an evolution of game currency; one that is portable from world to world with a constant traceable identity. The VMA wallet/API not only features the ability for users to exchange VMA across any VR/AR experience, environment or world, but also the ability for users to launch their own branded token coins. Branded coins will also be exchangeable between VR/AR experiences, environments and worlds, opening up a wholly secondary market for branded token coins. Ultimately, we will seamlessly allow value transfer from the virtual world to the real world and back again.","links":"https://vmeta.studio/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/virtualmeta/logo.png"}
