{"name":"Extraterrestrial Token","id":"extraterrestrial-token","symbol":"et","description":"ET is the utility token of SuperEx, which is the credential and basis for each SuperEx user to participate in ecosystem development, DAO governance, and ecosystem features. ET will play a crucial role in ecosystem development as an economic foundation and circulation hub. Users enjoy transaction fee discounts, VIP customer rights and privileges, first mining bonuses, project decision-making rights, and more. The economic model of ET is a permanent deflationary fixed-rate burning mechanism. SuperEx will continuously burn ET tokens through two mechanisms: buyback and burn and burning through voting. With the initial supply of 1 billion ET tokens, SuperEx has set a target of burning 800 million of the tokens, leaving only 200 million ET as the final supply.","links":"https://www.superex.com","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/extraterrestrial-token/logo.png"}
