{"name":"Pear Swap","id":"pear-swap","symbol":"pear","description":"PEAR Swap is the flagship product of the $PEAR token ecosystem. Through PEAR Swap, users will have the ability to perform both OTC (over the counter) and P2P (peer to peer) trades with other parties, without the intervention of a manually operated third party. The PEAR Swap system is backed by immutable smart contracts that users interact with, rather than needing a third party to manually confirm transactions. By pairing one user who wishes to sell a certain currency with another user who wishes to buy that same currency, PEAR facilitates and simplifies OTC/P2P transfers - and by providing the users with a secure, impregnable middleman (the PEAR platform and its immutable smart contracts), the system is impervious to manipulation or exploitation. PEAR Swap supports all forms of cryptocurrency including stablecoins/tether, allowing users to either publicly list or privately trade whatever currency they would like. There are no limits as to the size or frequency of trades.","links":"https://pearswap.net/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pear-swap/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x5dcd6272c3cbb250823f0b7e6c618bce11b21f90"}}}
