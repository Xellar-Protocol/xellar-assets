{"name":"Defi.money","id":"defi-money","symbol":"money","description":"$MONEY is a USD-denominated decentralized stablecoin, that can be minted by depositing collateral and opening a loan within the defi.money protocol. It distinguishes itself from other CDP-based stablecoins by utilizing an AMM-based liquidation mechanism that can buy or sell your collateral within a liquidation price range instead of a set price threshold. This protects users against full liquidations that otherwise could occur due to price volatility. $MONEY has been optimized for everyday users by being deployed on Layer 2 chains, to make even smaller loans cost-friendly due to much reduced gas costs. The protocol is also natively cross-chain, meaning it can be minted on multiple chains, as well as seamlessly be bridged between them.","links":"https://defi.money/","market_cap":10046896,"market_cap_rank":1559,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/defi-money/logo.png","detail_platform":{"optimistic-ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x69420f9e38a4e60a62224c489be4bf7a94402496"},"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x69420f9e38a4e60a62224c489be4bf7a94402496"}}}
