{"name":"The RugCoon","id":"the-rugcoon","symbol":"rugga","description":"The RugCoon is about poking fun at the amount of rug pulls that are launched and made each day on the Solana blockchain. It's a satirical jab at the general ecosystem, and ties in with the \"sneaky\" nature / perception of raccoons as an animal. The token represents a community of individuals who are sick of getting 'rugged', and also appreciate the devious nature of the main character, rugga as well as the satirical aura of the token itself.","links":"https://www.rugga.me/","market_cap":281465,"market_cap_rank":5132,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/the-rugcoon/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"2e4hookwoJmyAReeSRcTP5dE4myMnwfVvPSztDrjpump"}}}
