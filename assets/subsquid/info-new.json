{"name":"SQD","id":"subsquid","symbol":"sqd","description":"Subsquid Network is an innovative decentralized data lake and query engine designed to offer developers performant and permissionless access to data, aiming to build a neutral and open internet rooted in Web3 principles. Secured by ZK proofs, the Subsquid network boasts a modular architecture that enables exceptional scalability and developer convenience optimized for blockchain indexing, dApp development, and analytics. Subsquid is a response to unscalable and rigid monolithic indexing frameworks that had previously gained popularity and market traction among Web3 developers. Today, these frameworks are struggling to adapt in a rapidly evolving blockchain environment. Additionally, the network serves as a highly efficient and decentralized alternative to centralized infrastructure firms, including large RPC and API providers.","links":"https://sqd.dev","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/subsquid/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
