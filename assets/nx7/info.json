{"name":"NX7","id":"nx7","symbol":"nx7","description":"What is the project about? NFT7 is an NFT collection that serves as proof of fractional debt. The project aims to invest the cashflow generated from mint sell-outs in scalp trading and pay reward to NFTX7 holders in the form of NX7 tokens, which have a fixed reward value. NX7 is a transactional token and a peer-to-peer means of exchange used to transfer value within the network. Its main volume comes from issuers who transfer the financial reward value to NFTX7 holders. What makes your project unique? NX7 is a deflationary ecosystem that maintains its value by incentivizing and fueling transactions. Its primary utility is to pay NFTX7 holders a fixed-value reward, and token holders can utilize it to transfer wealth and value among themselves. The ecosystem has a built-in volume that fuels transactions and a deflationary model that can mathematically increase its value due to the burning effect and the automated market maker model, which defines the balancing method for pricing tokens. History of your project. NX7 was launched on July 7, 2023. Its issuance price was at 0.1$. Whatâ€™s next for your project? The project will continue as an investment vehicle as long as it is profitable. What can your token be used for?
