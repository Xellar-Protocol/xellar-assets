{"name":"Parabol USD","id":"parabol-usd","symbol":"parausd","description":"paraUSD is a fiat-backed stablecoin built on the Parabol Protocol, offering a revolutionary approach to yield generation in the stablecoin ecosystem. The protocol enables savers to access risk-free yields as a baseline through its innovative Reserve Stability Pool (RSP). Users can lend their paraUSD for specific time periods (like 28-day notes), earning both fixed income based on T-Bill rates and additional floating income derived from overnight repo market performance. Treasury departments can optimize cash management while maintaining security, and developers can easily embed these institutional-grade yields into their applications through Parabol's comprehensive APIs and SDKs. All positions are represented as NFTs that can be transferred across markets.","links":"https://www.parabol.fi","market_cap":255589,"market_cap_rank":6075,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/parabol-usd/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x1f94d6a61973edf53252b9e61c6250f303957b9d","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x1f94d6a61973edf53252b9e61c6250f303957b9d"}}}
