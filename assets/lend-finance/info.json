{"name":"Lend Finance","id":"lend-finance","symbol":"lend","description":"LEND is a multi-chain lending protocol with real yield value extraction from protocol to holder. A lending protocol that generates revenue through facilitating swaps and interest rate differentials, generating revenue on the spread. Lending pools have an algorithmically derived interest rate model, which is based on the current supply and demand of each asset. To ensure protocol safety from adverse events, we adopted a risk mitigated approach that requires borrowers to over-collateralization for optimal liquidity within protocol & unhealthy accounts are subject to automated liquidations. The money markets will only supply the most liquid assets available to further ensure the stability of the protocol.","links":"https://www.lend.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/lend-finance/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
