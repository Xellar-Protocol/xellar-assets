{"name":"Apollo Token","id":"apollo-token","symbol":"apollo","description":"A digital asset called Apollo Token is based on the Ethereum blockchain system. Without using an initial public offering (IPO), these tokens were distributed through a fair launch. The Apollo Token is a shining illustration of how decentralization may use the acceptance of cryptocurrencies to promote a specific idea or cause. The Apollo Token in this instance is committed to helping SpaceX's most recent creation, an AI dog named Apollo. The Boston Dynamic robotic dog that SpaceX is currently creating at its Starbase is being honored and celebrated with the Apollo Token. The Apollo Token is being released not only to honor SpaceX's amazing invention but also to raise money and rally support for its further development. Investors now have the opportunity to participate in the creation of this cutting-edge technology by purchasing Apollo Tokens, a high-potential asset. Apollo Token offers investors a singular opportunity to participate in the burgeoning cryptocurrency industry while simultaneously lending support to causes they care about. The issuing of tokens like the Apollo Token enables modest investors to take part in funding the development of the AI canine, in contrast to conventional fundraising techniques that typically demand large upfront funds from venture capitalists. In exchange, if the project's success results in the tokens' value increasing, these investors could perhaps see excellent returns. As an homage and investment tool that aims to transform how we explore space, the Apollo Token is a fantastic opportunity for anyone desiring to be at the forefront of scientific advancement.","links":"https://apollotoken.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/apollo-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x425d105913a04f4f95311788195ba13c3e82c3b9"}}}
