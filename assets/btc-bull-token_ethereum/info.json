{"name":"BTC Bull Token","id":"btc-bull-token_ethereum","symbol":"btcbull","description":"BTC Bull Token is about rallying a community around Bitcoin’s long-term adoption and reflecting that conviction in concrete token mechanics. Rather than relying only on memes, the project sets public BTC price checkpoints and ties them to on-chain events that holders can verify. As BTC advances toward each milestone, $BTCBULL actions follow a published playbook: supply burns to create a deflationary effect and BTC airdrops to reward committed participants who meet eligibility criteria. The aim is not to forecast or guarantee performance, but to direct community energy into transparent, rule-driven moments that celebrate Bitcoin’s progress and give holders structured ways to participate in the narrative without making financial promises.","links":"https://btcbulltoken.meme/","market_cap":1229827,"market_cap_rank":3501,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/btc-bull-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x8ee5cfb455b3ba5cb0bb5ad91cd6fc40ac73b25c","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x8ee5cfb455b3ba5cb0bb5ad91cd6fc40ac73b25c"}},"is_native":false}
