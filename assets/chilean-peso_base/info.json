{"name":"Chilean Peso","id":"chilean-peso_base","symbol":"wclp","description":"wCLP is a fully collateralized stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the Chilean peso (CLP). Issued and governed by a Ripio subsidiary, it brings CLP on-chain so Chileans and global users can transact, save, and build on decentralized networks in their local currency. Backed by Ripio’s since-2013 track record in LATAM, wCLP enables faster, cheaper CLP transfers, FX and remittance flows, DeFi trading and lending, and seamless on/off-ramps and payments without leaving the CLP unit of account.","links":"https://ripio.com/es/criptos/stablecoins-locales","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/chilean-peso/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x61d450a098b6a7f69fc4b98ce68198fe59768651","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x61d450a098b6a7f69fc4b98ce68198fe59768651"}},"is_native":false}
