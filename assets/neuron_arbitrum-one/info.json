{"name":"Neuron","id":"neuron_arbitrum-one","symbol":"nrn","description":"NRN is building an ecosystem that accelerates progress toward AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), using gaming and robotics as the sandbox. NRN Agents is a platform that powers AI agent integration in innovative gaming experiences in virtual and physical environments. The tech stack combines data aggregation, model training, and model inspection capabilities across imitation learning and reinforcement learning. Gaming and robotics provide the perfect testbed to tackle the challenge of achieving AGI. Games mirror the complexity of the real world, featuring dynamic rules and limitless variability that push AI to think beyond static tasks. Similarly, robotics extends these virtual learning environments into physical reality, training agents first in simulations before deploying them in the real world. This bridges the gap between virtual and physical, incorporating real-world complexities, variability, and constraints directly into AI training. The intersection of AI, gaming and robotics is more than entertainment—it’s a strategic approach to achieving AGI. AI agents trained in these environments won’t just master games; they’ll reason, adapt, and ultimately solve real-world challenges. The NRN Agents ecosystem is powered by the Neuron token $NRN.","links":"https://nrnagents.ai","market_cap":8026613,"market_cap_rank":1729,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/neuron/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xdadeca1167fe47499e53eb50f261103630974905","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/arbitrum/tokens/0xdadeca1167fe47499e53eb50f261103630974905"}},"is_native":false}
