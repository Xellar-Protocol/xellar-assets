{"name":"Snowbank","id":"snowbank","symbol":"sb","description":"Snowbank DAO is the decentralized reserve currency protocol available on the Avalanche Network based on the SB token. Each SB token is backed by a basket of assets (e.g., MIM, SB-AVAX LP Tokens etc etc) in the Snowbank DAO treasury, giving it an intrinsic value that it cannot fall below. Snowbank DAO also introduces economic and game-theoretic dynamics into the market through staking and minting.","links":"https://www.snowbank.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/snowbank/logo.png"}
