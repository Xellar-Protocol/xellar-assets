{"name":"LUCI","id":"luci","symbol":"luci","description":"Cute demon chilling in a very warm place. No dev, just Luci and the community. ðŸ‘¹ From the artist's account: \"I made this lil guy the other day, and I've been obsessed with him ever since. Trying something new here. Iâ€™ll keep creating LUCI content and breathing life into this cute demon & Iâ€™ll support community initiatives with art. But the rest is up to the community. I think CTOs are a great way to build strong communities, but I don't like that someone has to rug first for people to CTO itâ€”so that's why I'm trying this. I'm not sure what will happen, but I hope you'll like LUCI as much as I do.","links":"https://www.luci.gg","market_cap":872860,"market_cap_rank":4059,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/luci/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"5Ke381D44MEQg3BQarWhAwhj1xbdNvXe2KHkTiZzw7r5"}}}
