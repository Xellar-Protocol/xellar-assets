{"name":"IUCN Coin","id":"iucn-coin","symbol":"iucn","description":"IUCN is a membership Union composed of both government and civil society organisations. It harnesses the experience, resources and reach of its more than 1,400 Member organisations and the input of more than 17,000 experts to provide public, private and non-governmental organisations with the knowledge and tools that enable human progress, economic development and nature conservation to take place together. IUCN is the global authority on the status of the natural world and the measures needed to safeguard it. Its experts are organised into six Commissions dedicated to species survival, environmental law, protected areas, social and economic policy, ecosystem management, and education and communication. Created in 1948, IUCN has evolved into the worldâ€™s largest and most diverse environmental network.","links":"https://iucncoin.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/iucn-coin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0b4663216b812e4a2f0fc2029ff1232958f4bf8c"}}}
