{"name":"Doubloon","id":"doubloon","symbol":"dbl","description":"Galleon is a Set Protocol ecosystem project founded by Andrew from Set. With his experience working and collaborating with Set since the first version iteration of the protocol, two key opportunities have been identified in the sea of on-chain structured products â€” an ecosystem poised for exponential growth in 2022 and beyond. At present, the infrastructure laid down by Set enables scaled, fully composable, 100% collateralised structured products to be built. However, there has been a distinct lack of reliable strategy creators and implementers that are comfortable developing and managing index products in light of regulatory uncertainty, liquidity and funding. Our goal at Galleon is to research, curate and nurture a pipeline of products with the aim to be developed and deployed alongside Set ecosystem partners (e.g. Index Cooperative) whilst also having the advantage of a methodologist token to bootstrap growth and liquidity via incentives. In addition to launching structured products, Galleon seeks to create a DAO owned distribution platform tapping into the growth loops specific to Set tokens (issuance flows).","links":"https://www.galleon.community/","market_cap":3961.29,"market_cap_rank":4377,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/doubloon/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd3f1da62cafb7e7bc6531ff1cef6f414291f03d3"}}}
