{"name":"Mikki OS","id":"mikki-os_solana","symbol":"mikki_os","description":"MIKKI is an autonomous agent system designed for analyzing and trading on prediction markets. The project combines real-time data monitoring with algorithmic trading capabilities to identify profitable trading opportunities by detecting market inefficiencies. The system operates through several integrated modules that work together to generate trading signals. Its market scanner continuously monitors high-volume prediction markets, identifying discrepancies between displayed odds and actual probabilities by analyzing order book depth. The platform recognizes that market odds often reflect current order book conditions rather than true probability, creating opportunities when sophisticated traders position against crowd sentiment. MIKKI maintains a database of high-performing wallets through its whale tracker module, which monitors when experienced traders take contrarian positions. Additionally, a sentiment analysis engine processes social media data streams to identify divergences between public hype and actual market movement, flagging potential reversal opportunities when sentiment becomes overwhelmingly one-sided while price action stalls. MIKKI will execute autonomous trades using its own capital based on the signals generated by these analytical modules, with all transactions logged transparently for public auditing. The system also provides instant alert propagation to social media with sub-500ms latency, allowing followers to receive trading signals in real-time. Currently in version 2.0.4, the project appears to be in pre-launch phase, with users able to follow development progress and receive updates via the account on social media. The system explicitly disclaims that its outputs are probabilistic models and not financial advice.","links":"https://mikkios.fun/","market_cap":5747.23,"market_cap_rank":12159,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mikki-os/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"8CZf9HMSEfDpsjgovrj9xDgikPJ2XRMtGG6L4sLUpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/8CZf9HMSEfDpsjgovrj9xDgikPJ2XRMtGG6L4sLUpump"}},"is_native":false}
