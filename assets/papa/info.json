{"name":"Papa","id":"papa","symbol":"papa","description":"What is the project about? Papa Coin is a new digital currency inspired by the popular Pepe meme character and the community-driven nature of meme culture. It aims to foster creativity, collaboration, and connection among its users, while also adding a fun and engaging element to the digital asset ecosystem. What makes your project unique? PAPA aims to outperform many other meme coins by periodically targeting additional coins, with the goal of absorbing their liquidity and adding it to its own reserves. While PAPA may not be inherently evil, it has a voracious appetite. As the progenitor of all, PAPA's ongoing growth is essential. History of your project. Whatâ€™s next for your project? We will announce new tokens to feed Papa. What can your token be used for? Papa enjoys consuming other meme coins, and in return, rewards you with increased value. Each time Papa announces new meme coins it is ready to consume, users can deposit their old, outdated meme coins and feed them to Papa. They will receive Papa coins at a higher value, depending on for how long they choose to vest their PAPA coins.","links":"https://papa.army/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/papa/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6c4c193bff0a117f0c2b516802abba961a1eeb12"}}}
