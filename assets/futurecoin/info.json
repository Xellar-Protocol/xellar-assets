{"name":"FutureCoin","id":"futurecoin","symbol":"future","description":"FutureCoin aims to launch worldwide projects on and hold a substantial part of market segments, which in total are estimated to be valued at over 4 trillion dollars by 2030. TRADELINK will be the technology behind FutureCoin. After the migration from Binance blockchain, it will enter the TRADELINK ecosystem (a new blockchain with efficiency 1000 times higher than that of BITCOIN blockchain) and will have a higher and wider use on the INTERNET. The project was born in 2020 and continues to grow every day. Launched in 2021 following intense preparation from the team, the coin really began to catch life. FutureCoin provides global solutions to ordinary problems, for rapid technological development and progress for humankind. The field of technology is affected by big companies from various markets, which get richer and richer every single day and dominate FINTECH to gain digital control. FutureCoin wants to END this narrative and find sustainable and DECENTRALIZED solutions to said issues. We aim to start with the FINTECH industry - more specifically, the ability to send money easily, quickly, and safely all around the world - and eventually make our way into the fields of medicine, agriculture, and electric cars.","links":"https://e-futurecoin.com/","market_cap":3945325,"market_cap_rank":1943,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/futurecoin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x9fbff386a9405b4c98329824418ec02b5c20976b"}}}
