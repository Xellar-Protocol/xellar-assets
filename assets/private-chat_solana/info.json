{"name":"Private Chat","id":"private-chat_solana","symbol":"prvt","description":"PRVT.CHAT is a privacy-first, decentralized communication protocol on Solana, engineered to secure the Web3 era's messaging layer. Leveraging zero-knowledge compression from Light Protocol, PRVT.CHAT enables verifiable, high-efficiency end-to-end encrypted messaging, group chats, and file sharing with only encrypted data stored immutably on-chain. The $PRVT token powers this infrastructure, granting access to premium features like private cross-platform messaging sessions, decentralized domain identities (e.g., hello.prvt), and integrated Social Payments. PRVT.CHAT solves the inherent privacy vs. transparency dilemma of public blockchains, offering a solution-oriented, future-ready standard for confidential digital interaction.","links":"https://www.prvt.chat","market_cap":193270,"market_cap_rank":5966,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/private-chat/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"yhTd5ay9wnYWU5Pf6YncgEPA7ybpnqhdLT9poqhchat","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/yhTd5ay9wnYWU5Pf6YncgEPA7ybpnqhdLT9poqhchat"}},"is_native":false}
