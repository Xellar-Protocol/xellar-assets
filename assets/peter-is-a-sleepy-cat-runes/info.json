PETER·IS·A·SLEEPY·CAT is not just a project; it's a community-driven adventure that thrives on creativity and the spirit of togetherness in the digital realm. Launched in April, this initiative embodies the essence of dreaming big while embracing the peacefulness of sleep - symbolized by its charmingly sleepy cat mascot, Peter. This project stands out by integrating live-streaming as a core component, inviting followers into a world where they can watch, interact, and grow together in real-time. Whether it's for sharing quiet moments, creative sessions, or engaging discussions, PETER·IS·A·SLEEPY·CAT uses live-streaming to bridge distances, making every follower feel like they're part of Peter's sleepy, yet vibrant world. Join in to dream, create, and maybe even catch a nap with Peter, as this project continues to evolve, fostering a unique blend of relaxation and community engagement.","links":"https://x.com/petersleepycat","market_cap":155968,"market_cap_rank":5730,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/peter-is-a-sleepy-cat-runes/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
