{"name":"PLANZ","id":"planz","symbol":"z","description":"PLANZ.inc will issue $Z as a corporate token. Unlike tokens dedicated to specific DApps (such as games or DeFi), $Z is associated with all 10+ projects in which PLANZ.inc is involved. How tokens will be used after buyback A certain percentage of the revenue from each project will be used to buy back **$Z tokens** and distribute the tokens as follows: 50% → Distributed as $Z staking rewards 50% → Stored as **treasury** and used for future reward distributions This mechanism will sustainably increase the value of $Z and support the development of the entire PLANZ.inc ecosystem. In addition, PLANZ.inc will use a portion of the revenue from each project it operates or partners with to buy back $Z.","links":"https://planz.tech/","market_cap":3479632,"market_cap_rank":2719,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/planz/logo.png","detail_platform":{"oasys":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc683da627ff9fd56740c72a703528861c33d3b3a","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/oasys/tokens/0xc683da627ff9fd56740c72a703528861c33d3b3a"}}}
