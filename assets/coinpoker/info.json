{"name":"CoinPoker","id":"coinpoker","symbol":"chp","description":"CoinPoker is a worldwide cryptocurrency-based online poker room that’s launching its ICO this November. We’re operating with Ethereum Smart Contracts and once the room will have been launched, we’re going to ensure full transparency via the use of blockchains. The RNG will be visible on blockchains, and the players will be able to see it after the game. That together with the pain-free transactions thanks to cryptocurrency will solve many of the problems that online poker has been facing. • Transactions will be immediate + accessible worldwide; • RnG will be visible for transparency; • Anonymity will be guaranteed; • Fair play at the tables will be ensured. + HUGE Grand Opening Events with awesome prizes (15% of tokens distributed during the ICO will be returned during these tournaments). What makes us different from other ICOs? Well, for one, we’ve got our MVP (minimum viable product, in our case – an app) ready to go, and we’ll be launching our MVP with play money before our actual ICO start!","links":"https://coinpoker.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/coinpoker/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0a6e18fb2842855c3af925310b0f50a4bfa17909"},"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x59b5654a17ac44f3068b3882f298881433bb07ef"}}}
