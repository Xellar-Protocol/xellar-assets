{"name":"FrenGate","id":"frengate","symbol":"$fgate","description":"What is the project about? Frengate is dedicated to enhancing and expanding the Friend Tech ecosystem by addressing its current gaps. Our primary objective is to simplify and optimize the capabilities available to creators within this ecosystem. What makes your project unique? Frengate distinguishes itself as the pioneering service that fills critical gaps within the Friend Tech ecosystem. We not only streamline the onboarding process for creators but also provide comprehensive analytics that are unmatched elsewhere. History of your project. Frengate's journey began several weeks ago when a team member, a devoted Friend Tech user, recognized significant infrastructure improvements that could benefit the platform. This pursuit of enhancement aligns with the fact that Friend Tech is still in its beta phase. Whatâ€™s next for your project? Frengate is set to expand its analytics offerings, introduce more flexible options for creators to integrate their Friend Tech communities with Frengate, and provide incentives to users who invest in the project. What can your token be used for? The Frengate token serves as the primary payment method for accessing our services. Users will be required to burn tokens on a monthly basis, similar to a subscription model. Additionally, we have plans to introduce farming and staking rewards for our users in the near future.","links":"https://frengate.app/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/frengate/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x97808df7afb14134d37a91576bdb8b95dfcd2e92"}}}
