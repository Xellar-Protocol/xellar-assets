{"name":"The Vault","id":"the-vault-2","symbol":"vault","description":"The Vault Project introduces VAULT tokens, a unique digital asset with a primary purpose of enabling arbitrage opportunities for users. VAULT tokens can be bought and sold on Uniswap, a decentralized exchange, and when their price on Uniswap falls below the smart contract's rate, users can profit by selling them directly to the smart contract through a user-friendly DApp. This innovative mechanism enhances market efficiency, maintains price stability, provides essential liquidity, and importantly, tokens sold to the DApp are permanently burned, reducing the overall token supply.","links":"https://thevault.capital/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/the-vault-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc0a22849fa6122594e605aec943413734137daab"}}}
