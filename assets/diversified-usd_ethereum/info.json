{"name":"Diversified USD","id":"diversified-usd_ethereum","symbol":"dfiusd","description":"DiversiFi is The Stablecoin Diversification Protocol, engineered to strengthen collateral stability across decentralized finance. The project addresses a key problem in DeFi, single-asset stablecoins create high volatility and depeg risks, threatening protocol reserves and leveraged positions. A single depeg event can cause cascading liquidations and erode user trust. DiversiFi’s solution is DFiUSD, a fully collateralized, multi-stablecoin asset that aggregates and dynamically rebalances reserves across leading stablecoins to ensure full collateralization, dampen depeg severity by 70–90%, and enhance overall liquidity and reliability. Through this architecture, DiversiFi reinforces long-term confidence and stability across the DeFi ecosystem","links":"https://diversifi.tech/","market_cap":186215,"market_cap_rank":6023,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/diversified-usd_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xdf100b8abd3cd41fc5cc1236ad7c6629a901afbf","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xdf100b8abd3cd41fc5cc1236ad7c6629a901afbf"}},"is_native":false}
