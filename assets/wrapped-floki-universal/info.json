FLOKI is a memecoin and utility token for the Floki Ecosystem. The Floki Ecosystem is a community-powered ecosystem that aims to give people control of their finances through six key utility offerings: The Valhalla NFT Metaverse Game, The Floki Trading Bot, The FlokiFi DeFi ecosystem, The University Of Floki Crypto Education platform, The TokenFi platform, The Floki Staking program, and The FlokiPlaces NFT & Merchandise Marketplace. Universal is a cross-chain asset protocol that enables users to trade and utilize wrapped assets (uAssets) across multiple blockchains. uAssets are 1:1 backed representations of native cryptocurrencies, such as XRP, DOGE, and SUI, held in secure custody. This allows users to access and transact with assets that are not natively available on their preferred chains, without relying on bridges or centralized exchanges. Universal provides seamless trading, liquidity provision, and lending opportunities for uAssets, ensuring deep liquidity and security through institutional-grade custody and real-time proof of reserves.","links":"https://www.universal.xyz/tokens/uFLOKI","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wrapped-floki-universal/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xcb474f3dee195a951f3584b213d16d2d4d4ee503","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xcb474f3dee195a951f3584b213d16d2d4d4ee503"}}}
