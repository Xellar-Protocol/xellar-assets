{"name":"NOTE","id":"note-2","symbol":"note","description":"NOTE protocol is the world’s first smart contract protocol based on Bitcoin’s Layer 1 network. By integrating on-chain data (DA), off-chain indexers (Indexer), and smart contract verifiers (Satoshi’s original BVM/sCrypt development language), NOTE provides secure and scalable smart contract functionality on the Bitcoin network. With over 100 million global Bitcoin users, NOTE aims to significantly expand Bitcoin’s use cases by directly enabling smart contracts on the Bitcoin network, potentially opening a new multi-billion-dollar market for decentralized applications (dApps).","links":"https://noteprotocol.org","market_cap":2078953,"market_cap_rank":2553,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/note-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ordinals":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"60bdd72c938e66c80e0f4b2f581cb7f69aec851e430f8867233196945b18c886"}}}
