{"name":"Bitcoin Base","id":"bitcoin-base_base","symbol":"btc","description":"Bitcoin Base (BTCB) is a memecoin launched on the Base network. The project is designed to represent a playful, community-driven version of Bitcoin within the Base ecosystem. It mirrors Bitcoin’s original total supply of 21,000,000 tokens, but does not aim to replicate its technology or functionality. Bitcoin Base serves primarily as a community token with no inherent utility beyond its memecoin identity.","links":"https://baseoff.xyz","market_cap":787707,"market_cap_rank":4015,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bitcoin-base_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xfaf1c31f6855e91b1a905761c81a79e4966e4709","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xfaf1c31f6855e91b1a905761c81a79e4966e4709"}},"is_native":false}
