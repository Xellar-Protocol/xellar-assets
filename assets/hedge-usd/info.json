{"name":"Hedge USD","id":"hedge-usd","symbol":"ush","description":"HDG is one of the tokens issued by the Hedge Protocol which enables interest-free lending on the Solana Blockchain. Users are able to deposit collateral and take out USH stablecoin loans. The Hedge Protocol offers vaults with a minimum collateral ratio as low as 110% (90.0% LTV). USH is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar that is always redeemable for its underlying value - i.e. users are able to use it to purchase collateral back at any time. However a fee is added on top to ensure redemptions don't happen too often.","links":"https://www.hedge.so/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/hedge-usd/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"9iLH8T7zoWhY7sBmj1WK9ENbWdS1nL8n9wAxaeRitTa6"}}}
