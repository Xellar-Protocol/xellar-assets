{"name":"SPUD","id":"spud","symbol":"spud","description":"Spud Buy Bot is a Telegram-native live-trade tracker for Abstract-Chain tokens. By reading the chain’s mempool and Dexscreener API, it detects every buy to a token’s LP, formats the data—buyer wallet, spend, tokens received, price impact, refreshed market-cap and chart link—and pushes an eye-catching embed to your group. One /setup command activates the hosted service; no servers, no API keys, plus optional daily CSV digests for deeper insight.","links":"https://spudonabstract.com/","market_cap":613220,"market_cap_rank":4845,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/spud/logo.png","detail_platform":{"abstract":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x44cca204fd7a6b357ed88c2c5fefa667ee7be305","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/abstract/tokens/0x44cca204fd7a6b357ed88c2c5fefa667ee7be305"}}}
