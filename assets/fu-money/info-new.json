{"name":"FU Money","id":"fu-money","symbol":"fu","description":"FU Money is what connects all FU Studios productions and supports the ecosystem. It has two main functions, utility and value accrual. Inspired by EIP 1559 the utility function requires users to burn $FU, this cements it as the base money for FU Studios. $FU not only gives access to exclusive features to users but it can also be converted to a share of the revenue generated by all FU Studios productions.","links":"https://openseason.games/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/fu-money/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6c05b8141cefb64502b6dfcaae7c77babbac18fa"},"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x130096af9163b185cae4a833f856760199fc6ceb"},"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8f4e4221ba88d4e9bb76ecfb91d7c5ce08d7d5b9"}}}
