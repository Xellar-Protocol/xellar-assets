{"name":"Pundi X PURSE","id":"pundi-x-purse_ethereum","symbol":"purse","description":"$PURSE, the Pundi X reward token, is now available on both BEP20 and Pundi X Chain. The purpose of the token is to incentivize XPOS usage, expand Pundi X Chain’s ecosystem and increase $PUNDIX value through rewards, gamification (lucky draw / lottery), discount vouchers and redemption for NFTs and other tokens. $PURSE can be sent between Pundi X Chain and Binance Smart Chain. There’s no pre-minted tokens or allocation in any form for the team. All initial supply goes to $PUNDIX holders and for absorbing $NPXSXEM tokens, thus sunsetting our support for $NPXSXEM.","links":"https://purse.land/","market_cap":99211,"market_cap_rank":7019,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pundi-x-purse/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x95987b0cdc7f65d989a30b3b7132a38388c548eb","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x95987b0cdc7f65d989a30b3b7132a38388c548eb"}},"is_native":false}
