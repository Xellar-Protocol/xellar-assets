{"name":"Camp Network","id":"camp-network_ethereum","symbol":"camp","description":"Camp Network is a purpose-built Layer-1 blockchain for powering AI agents trained on provenance-backed, user-owned IP. Camp's Autonomous IP Layer enables anyone to tokenize IP — music, images, videos, even personal data — and register it onchain for AI training, remixing, and monetization. Its architecture prioritizes gasless IP registration and royalty distribution, and supports isolated execution environments tailored for agent-based workflows and automated licensing. Developers can launch dedicated app chains with isolated blockspace and compute, offering the flexibility and scalability needed for high-performance workloads.","links":"https://www.campnetwork.xyz/","market_cap":14671407,"market_cap_rank":1287,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/camp-network/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x84eaac1b2dc3f84d92ff84c3ec205b1fa74671fc","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x84eaac1b2dc3f84d92ff84c3ec205b1fa74671fc"}},"is_native":false}
