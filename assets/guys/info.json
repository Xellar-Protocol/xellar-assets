The game combines elements from various classic arcade games, offering a unique and enjoyable gaming experience. Unlike many cryptocurrency games that focus predominantly on the earning aspect, Hole Guys emphasizes player enjoyment, ensuring a rewarding experience regardless of the game's outcome. The payment system in Hole Guys mimics the traditional arcade style. Players invest a small amount, similar to inserting a quarter, to test their skills. The game is designed to be accessible to all players, regardless of their financial capacity, with a minimal risk of significant financial loss. This approach contrasts with other crypto games that often involve gambling elements and the potential for large losses. The game's economic model is transparent and sustainable. Players pay 100 points, equivalent to 0.0001 ETH (approximately $0.20 USD), to participate. Upon losing, their points are allocated in a structured manner: 75% of the points go into the game's jackpot. 10% are directed into a player payout fund. 5% contribute to a lottery system, with each game granting a lottery ticket. 7% are used for a revenue-sharing layer, offering extra free plays to players. 3% support the operational team behind the game. Hole Guys stands out for its balance of enjoyable gameplay and the potential for financial rewards, all within a framework that is accessible and fair to players.","links":"https://holeguys.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/guys/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb4725590574bb8afae4a3f44f05f9c0f5ebd8f4b"}}}
