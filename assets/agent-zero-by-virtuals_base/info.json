{"name":"Agent Zero by Virtuals","id":"agent-zero-by-virtuals_base","symbol":"zero","description":"Virtuals nailed the launch moment. But what’s missing is the structured scaffolding around it: Pre-launch rigor: helping projects scope MVPs, cost out GTM, and validate PMF before tokens trade. Post-launch rigor: ensuring that once tokens are live, projects have transparent milestones, accountable use of funds, and a clear pathway to product-market fit. Without these, launchpads risk becoming hype cycles — not sustainable growth engines. That’s where Ground Zero comes in. We’re building the missing layer in the Virtuals funnel: a pre-launchpad proving ground that turns whitepapers into launchpad-ready products. Here’s how it works: AI Scoring Projects self-submit data. Our AI evaluates them across 7 categories: MVP, PMF, Team, Industry, Community, Go-To-Market, and Competitors. First Raise (up to $10K) If a project scores above 25/100, they unlock their first raise — up to $10K. This funds: An initial marketing campaign to test traction Technical scoping: roadmap & cost to MVP or income-generating product Costed PMF testing plan Costed GTM strategy Second Raise (Milestone-Based) Armed with a clear scope, projects then raise enough to fund either: The build of their MVP, or The path to an income-generating product Funding is released in tranches tied to progress reports, with investors voting on whether to release the next tranche.","links":"https://www.bionicdao.com/","market_cap":20321,"market_cap_rank":9763,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/agent-zero-by-virtuals_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xecc2a75027063a0c2769ecd6b133a8683128c8b3","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xecc2a75027063a0c2769ecd6b133a8683128c8b3"}},"is_native":false}
