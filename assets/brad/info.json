{"name":"Brad","id":"brad","symbol":"brad","description":"Brad is no ordinary dog – he's a rough, patriotic outsider with a taste for real life and straight talk. In his gritty, slightly rundown apartment, he chills with an unmistakable mix of attitude and a vision that's set to change the world. Brad is more than just a dog – he's a movement. A voice for freedom, progress, and a bit of madness. He's not afraid to say the things others don't dare to speak, and he represents a new kind of hype. But Brad isn't just a rebel – he's a crypto trader from the early days, a true memecoin pioneer. After shaking up the markets, he's now launching his own coin – one that's fair, transparent, and ready to revolutionize the crypto world. No nonsense, no tricks – Brad stands for real values. And this is just the beginning. Brad believes that crypto is more than just money – it's a movement. An opportunity to make America great again and give people a platform for freedom and innovation","links":"https://bradtoken.com/","market_cap":828776,"market_cap_rank":3868,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/brad/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x91dd62e33c8d3f4ebef942c1d98e1298ba0f0029","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x91dd62e33c8d3f4ebef942c1d98e1298ba0f0029"}}}
