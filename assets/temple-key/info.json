{"name":"Temple Key","id":"temple-key","symbol":"tkey","description":"What is the project about? Temple Key (TKEY) is a native token for Temple Wallet, which was created to develop wallet and incentive users within wallet functionality. Temple is a main Tezos wallet for storing TEZ (XTZ), Tezos-built tokens and interacting with dApps and NFTs. What makes your project unique? Temple wallet is the most popular wallet for Tezos tokens, dApps, and NFTs. In addition to all the features that a Web3 wallet should have, Temple contains cashback, an earn page, delegating TEZ feature, and other interesting opportunities. History of your project. Temple Wallet was created and launched in 2020 by Madfish Solutions for the Tezos tokens and dApps. Tezos Foundation funded the development of the wallet on a grant basis. Whatâ€™s next for your project? Temple Key (TKEY) will receive new mechanics and utility inside the ecosystem of MadFish products, among which are QuipuSwap and Temple Wallet. What can your token be used for? Temple wallet users receive 0.175% of the swapped amount in the TKEY token as cashback. These tokens are taken from the market through TKEY buying. Another 0.175% of the swapped amount is used for buyback and burn TKEY. In addition, the rewards from the initially provided liquidity in the wTEZ/TKEY pool by the devs team are used in the following way: fee rewards in the TKEY token are burned, while fee rewards in wTEZ are used for buyback and burn TKEY.","links":"https://templewallet.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/temple-key/logo.png","detail_platform":{"tezos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"KT1VaEsVNiBoA56eToEK6n6BcPgh1tdx9eXi"}}}
