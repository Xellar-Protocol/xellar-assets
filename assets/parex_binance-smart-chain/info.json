{"name":"Parex","id":"parex_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"prx","description":"Parex is a decentralized exchange. It also has a token that can only exist through the mining production mechanism. The production network is processed with the DRC-16 protocol. It can also build bridges with many networks thanks to Proof of Interoperability. Thanks to Parex Proof of Interoperability, it establishes interoperable bridges with other networks. There is a balance between all networks. Circulation is common. Polygon, BEP20, Ethereum, Polkadot, Avax etc. Burning is common. As soon as the PRX token is sent to production, it is burned and falls out of circulation. It continues its existence as a community\u0002oriented project to overcome all difficulties. The Proof of Interoperability mechanism ensures that the PRX token is an interoperable token in every network. In this way, every inter-network transfer is possible thanks to Parex Market. Switching between networks takes place at low fees and quickly through the Parex Market. Bridge makes tiring routes easy for PRX.","links":"https://parex.network","market_cap":130368,"market_cap_rank":6585,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/parex_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x51bd0d0853b7596b6f1aca8d2be6816774271733","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x51bd0d0853b7596b6f1aca8d2be6816774271733"}},"is_native":false}
