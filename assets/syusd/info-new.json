{"name":"syUSD","id":"syusd","symbol":"syusd","description":"Synnax is the first SEI-backed digital dollar on the SEI blockchain, offering users the ability to tokenize assets such as $iSEI and $SEI to issue $syUSD. Our mission is to enhance financial efficiency by empowering users to leverage their yield-bearing tokens to mint and borrow synthetic dollars. This process unlocks previously inaccessible capital, enabling users to take out dollar-pegged loans and use $syUSD across a variety of applications within the ecosystem. By integrating this innovative solution, we aim to provide greater flexibility and financial opportunities for users while strengthening the overall DeFi infrastructure on SEI.","links":"https://www.synnax.fi/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/syusd/logo.png","detail_platform":{"sei-v2":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xbb5850008495b4d7e4c242e30ffc5b6a0f7e916e"}}}
