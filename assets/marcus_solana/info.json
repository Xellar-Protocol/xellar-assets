{"name":"Marcus","id":"marcus_solana","symbol":"marcus","description":"Marcus the Worm ($MARCUS) is a community-driven memecoin inspired by the viral VRChat character “Marcus the Worm”. The character, a bipedal worm avatar, spread on TikTok and other social medias in early 2025 through clips posted by streamers and content creators. The token was created as a cultural reference and digital collectible within the broader meme ecosystem. It does not claim to have intrinsic utility or financial value but serves primarily as a community experiment and expression of internet culture.","links":"https://thecultofmarcus.com","market_cap":3383.69,"market_cap_rank":12820,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/marcus/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"62kbvt7xtSoetP3veAhPBV9YzZn9P67R19GfQRVApump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/62kbvt7xtSoetP3veAhPBV9YzZn9P67R19GfQRVApump"}},"is_native":false}
