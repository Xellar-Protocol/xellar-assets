{"name":"ALINK AI","id":"alink-ai","symbol":"alink","description":"Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) aims to develop machines capable of exhibiting human-level intelligence in a wide range of tasks, rather than being specialised in just one. Unlike narrow AI, AGI will be able to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can, in principle, perform. The development of AGI is a challenging problem, and it is still an area of active research and development. The eventual achievement of AGI could have profound implications for humanity, and it is the subject of both scientific inquiry and science fiction. ALINK empowers a blockchain-based open and decentralised marketplace for AGI services, allowing anyone with an internet connection to request and provide services that are germane to AGI. Such services can offer predictions or model building in a wide range of areas including speech, text, image, video, time-series, and network analysis. They can range from a simple application of a widely used algorithm to a comprehensive solution for an industry issue or a standalone AI program. Additionally, developers can launch self-governing AI programs that can interact with other services on the network.","links":"https://alink.ai","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/alink-ai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"0x78e624070871831842730b43f77467af3e8b580c","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x78e624070871831842730b43f77467af3e8b580c"}}}
