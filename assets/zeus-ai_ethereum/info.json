{"name":"Zeus AI","id":"zeus-ai_ethereum","symbol":"zeus","description":"Zeus is Elons Robot Dog which lives on the SpaceX launch site. He supports Optimus's journey to success. $ZEUS is the companion token created to support Optimus on its journey to mainstream adoption. With its attachment to Elon Musk, Optimus is set to become the next viral meme coin. As we move towards a future dominated by Artificial Intelligence (AI), $ZEUS represents the perfect merger between our love for dogs and AI technology. Zeus isn’t just a meme We recognise that blockchain represents the future of a trust-less system, but to ensure the safety of DeFi, we are constructing Zeus KYD. About Zeus Boston Dynamics is a company that specialises in manufacturing robots. One of their creations is a quadruped robot that resembles a canine, named ‘Spot’. It was designed to perform risky tasks that are difficult or impossible for humans to undertake. SpaceX, a space exploration firm owned by Elon Musk, acquired ‘Spot’ for $70,000 to assist with the testing of their starship rockets at their Boca Chica launch site. After purchasing the robot, Elon affectionately named it Zeus and set up a kennel on-site with the name ‘Zeus’ inscribed on it. The $ZEUS token is completely community-driven as it’s liquidity is burnt. Nevertheless, taxes generated from its transaction will be utilised to finance the development of Zeus KYD.","links":"https://www.zeusaibot.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/zeus-ai_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6ef460eb3563cfcc73f8147b0a77daffee71f867","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x6ef460eb3563cfcc73f8147b0a77daffee71f867"}},"is_native":false}
