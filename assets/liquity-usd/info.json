{"name":"Liquity USD","id":"liquity-usd","symbol":"lusd","description":"LUSD is a fully redeemable USD-pegged stablecoin issued by the Liquity Protocol. Liquity is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows you to draw 0% interest loans against Ether used as collateral. Loans are paid out in LUSD and need to maintain a minimum collateral ratio of only 110%. In addition to the collateral, the loans are secured by a Stability Pool containing LUSD and by fellow borrowers collectively acting as guarantors of last resort. Liquity as a protocol is non-custodial, immutable, and governance-free.","links":"https://www.liquity.org/","market_cap":80730681,"market_cap_rank":387,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/liquity-usd/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x5f98805a4e8be255a32880fdec7f6728c6568ba0"},"zksync":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x503234f203fc7eb888eec8513210612a43cf6115"},"optimistic-ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc40f949f8a4e094d1b49a23ea9241d289b7b2819"},"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x93b346b6bc2548da6a1e7d98e9a421b42541425b"},"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x23001f892c0c82b79303edc9b9033cd190bb21c7"}}}
