{"name":"Ember","id":"ember-2","symbol":"embr","description":"Ember makes token creation and customization accessible for everybody. It streamlines the process into a just a few clicks, and offers optional access to deep liquidity with very little upfront capital. Liquidity used during the token creation process is owned by the protocol until the terms of the loan are completely satisfied. This means that the token created is temporarily owned by the protocol during this period. This is necessary to avoid loss of funds for the protocol and users by preventing the creator from dumping tokens on early buyers. When a liquidity package is selected, the default term is one week. This can be extended with boosts. If predetermined volume metrics are met, the one week period is automatically extended. Failure to meet the volume requirements marks the project as ‘unhealthy’.","links":"https://ember.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ember-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x1936ae42b59876192a2e263b3807343c448e3c85"}}}
