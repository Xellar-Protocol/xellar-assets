{"name":"CHOW CHOW","id":"chow-chow","symbol":"chow","description":"$CHOW is a community-centered cryptocurrency project that embodies the essence of the Chow Chow dog breed, a symbol of strength, loyalty, and unity. Inspired by these virtues, the project is designed to reconquer the decentralization and freedom that have been compromised in the crypto market. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, $CHOW aims to leverage the power of community participation to drive its mission. Every holder of $CHOW, referred to as a member of the #CHOWARMY, is integral to the project's success. It's a system that transcends token ownership and encourages active contribution through content creation, community interaction, and promotion. At the heart of this endeavor is King Chow Zhou, the visionary leading the community towards the true spirit of cryptocurrency. However, he is not a figure standing above but among the community, committed to dedicating his time and energy to the growth and success of $CHOW. $CHOW looks forward to further developing its platform, expanding its community, and introducing more collaborations, all while preserving its core values of freedom, equality, and unity. The project also advocates for the sharing of knowledge and support among its community members, thereby facilitating an environment conducive to progress and innovation. The $CHOW token represents much more than a digital asset; it is a testament to participation in a community striving for market decentralization and the universal accessibility of cryptocurrency. Token holders can engage in a range of activities, promote $CHOW, forge connections, and potentially partner with influencers and exchanges. The ultimate goal of $CHOW is not only to succeed as a cryptocurrency but also to spark a movement that embodies the resilient spirit of the Chow Chow.","links":"https://chowchowtoken.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/chow-chow/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x3e362038fd3d08887d498944d489af7909619a9b"}}}
