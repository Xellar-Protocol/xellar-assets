{"name":"SpaceChain (ERC-20)","id":"spacechain-erc-20","symbol":"spc","description":"The key to Space Chain is to deploy all blockchain nodes on satellites so as to bring blockchain technology into space, adding a new dimension to blockchain’s core concept of distributed ledger by making use of space technology and advantages of space resources. As a space blockchain platform featuring data collecting, computing, application and storage, Space Chain uses satellites as its blockchain nodes for realizing direct on-satellite data processing and secure in-space data storage through cryptographic technologies such as quantum communications. Different from ground-network-based blockchain technology, Space chain provides a broader coverage and is based on a network of LEO satellites for achieving broad-based connectivity so that anyone and anything could become the user of blockchain technology anywhere and anytime.","links":"http://spacechain.com/","market_cap":12325063,"market_cap_rank":1432,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/spacechain-erc-20/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x86ed939b500e121c0c5f493f399084db596dad20"}}}
