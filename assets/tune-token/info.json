{"name":"TUNE TOKEN","id":"tune-token","symbol":"tune","description":"Tune Software is a software development and management company primarily focused on creating blockchain based technology, smart contract design and digital tokenized applications. Tuneâ€™s primary mission is to solve digital songwriter rights and royalty transparency issues for the music industry. Furthermore, the establishment of our tokenized products will enable applications the ability to offer user tipping and user/community incentivized rewards through the sharing, creation and engagement of content, as well as other features. Tune is proud to announce a licensing agreement with the TechCrunch Disrupt Cup award winning Cre8tor.app (formerly RecordGram) application. The existing Cre8tor.app (formerly RecordGram) community will act as the catalyst in the application and practical utility of the TUNE token to demonstrate, build and grow community. In a day and age where access to resources, material or otherwise, is becoming increasingly egalitarian; we see access to curated music content and appropriate compensation, thereafter and through, as no different. We are trying to create the first international songwriter database for new music creations by redefining the future of music rights and royalty transparency on the Blockchain. Cre8tor.app (formerly RecordGram) is revolutionizing the way music content is distributed and made available. Tune wants to apply that same methodology and intertwine it with the power and efficiency of cryptography, decentralization and immutability.","links":"https://www.tunetoken.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/tune-token/logo.png"}
