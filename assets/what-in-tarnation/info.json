{"name":"What in Tarnation?","id":"what-in-tarnation","symbol":"wit","description":"The \"What in tarnation\" meme is a humorous internet meme that plays on a stereotype of a Southern American expression of bewilderment or surprise. The meme format typically includes an image of an animal or person, often with a cowboy hat added digitally to emphasize the Southern aspect. The phrase \"What in tarnation?\" is an archaic and humorously exaggerated way of saying \"What in the world?\" or \"What on Earth?\" The comedic element is enhanced by the juxtaposition of the cowboy hat with subjects that are incongruous or absurd, creating a visual pun. The text that accompanies these images usually follows the structure of \"What in [X]\" where [X] is a playful substitution that rhymes with \"tarnation\" or is related to the context of the image, adding another layer of humor. For example, if the image includes a Shiba Inu dog with a cowboy hat, the caption might playfully read, \"What in doggernation?\" which rhymes with tarnation and fits the image of the dog. It's a light-hearted meme that's enjoyed for its silly puns and the ridiculous imagery of seeing animals or objects in a Western motif that wouldn't normally be associated with it.","links":"https://whatintarn.org","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/what-in-tarnation/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"Adq3wnAvtaXBNfy63xGV1YNkDiPKadDT469xF9uZPrqE"}}}
