Just as God created the cosmos, Akasha aims to create a unified digital ecosystem. The project is built on the concept of a universal life force, known as Akasha, which is akin to the Holy Spirit and other spiritual energies. Akasha technology functions as an invisible, seamless layer connecting Web1, Web2, Web3, and traditional systems, making digital interactions feel as natural as breathing. The projectâ€™s vision extends beyond blockchain, aiming to unify all aspects of life and commerce, eliminating barriers between traditional finance and decentralized systems. Over six years, with 60 senior developers, the technology has evolved to offer effortless interoperability and accessibility for all users. The roadmap focuses on global adoption, aiming to generate $300 million in liquidity and bring thousands of new wallets into the ecosystem, creating a truly interconnected world where finance and technology merge seamlessly.","links":"https://akashalife.org","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/akashalife/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x54b659832f59c24cec0e4a2cd193377f1bcefc3c"}}}
