{"name":"bm2k","id":"bm2k","symbol":"bm2k","description":"BM2K is a DRC20 token (free mint) created to honor Billy Markus, the creator of Dogecoin! It had a fair launch and was officially the first DRC20 token to reach Billy's Dogecoin wallet. Moreover, it was the first DRC20 token to publicly complete a transaction for the purchase and sale of a real service and also a doginals NFT using DRC20. BM2K is currently one of the leading DRC20 tokens with one of the highest trading volumes. BM2K has also been called 'interesting haha' and 'very beta' by Billy Markus. BM2K was created by Ryuushibe, a fan and admirer of Billy Markus, who played a significant role in the early days of the Doginals protocol launch alongside Apezord. An amusing fact is that BM2K was also the first token to reach Elon Musk's Dogecoin wallet. wow BM2K was also the first DRC20 token to make a charity donation by contributing 14,200 DRC20 tokens (bm2k) to a humanitarian aid NGO in Africa!","links":"https://bm2k.vercel.app/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bm2k/logo.png","detail_platform":{"dogechain":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":"8124868ef4b524325487f5f4ebfb110f6d89f79acd2756deaba264b791294b95i0"}}}
