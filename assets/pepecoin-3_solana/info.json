{"name":"PEPECOIN","id":"pepecoin-3_solana","symbol":"pep","description":"Pepecoin ($PEP) is the first Pepe altcoin in blockchain history. It launched on April 14, 2015, making it the original Pepe on-chain, long before later versions appeared. The project was announced on Bitcointalk with the tagline: “Pepecoin – the best coin in the memeverse – buy ur rare pepes.” Its home was pepecoin.ga, where early miners and holders gathered. With a total supply of 38,400,000 PEP and 4-minute block times, it carried the true genesis frog. The project struggled and eventually faded. In the last post of the original Bitcointalk thread, the team behind a new PepeCoin (2016) wrote: “This coin was not successful, we have launched a working version here.” From that moment, confusion blurred the timeline — but history cannot be rewritten. The first Pepe on the blockchain was this one, in 2015. In 2025, the forgotten frog returns through its original home, pepecoin.ga, marking the rebirth of the genesis Pepe — now revived to become the next great pump of the internet.","links":"https://pepecoin.ga","market_cap":70749,"market_cap_rank":7623,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pepecoin-3_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"BKmYE8w1GEQ6khhLkvMj4ULvV4Gq7zLfJZSgsHE5pump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/BKmYE8w1GEQ6khhLkvMj4ULvV4Gq7zLfJZSgsHE5pump"}},"is_native":false}
