{"name":"Clips","id":"clips","symbol":"clips","description":"$CLIPS is a Capture the Flag x Memetoken project that has also been described as Fomo3d x XEN x Million Dollar Homepage. The supply was provided to the community as a free mint that rocketed CLIPS into the top 3 mainnet gas guzzlers upon launch. Players use $CLIPS token to change a message on the website homepage, with a big prizepool to be won if the message is kept on the page for 7 days. There are also deflationary mechanics - each time the homepage message is overtaken, the $CLIPS used are burned.","links":"https://www.clipstoken.xyz","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/clips/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xecbee2fae67709f718426ddc3bf770b26b95ed20"}}}
