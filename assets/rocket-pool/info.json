{"name":"Rocket Pool","id":"rocket-pool","symbol":"rpl","description":"Rocket Pool is Ethereumâ€™s most decentralised liquid staking protocol. Liquid stakers can participate by depositing as little as 0.01 ETH to receive the rETH liquid staking token. Rocket Pool is a fully non-custodial solution, and its node operators are economically-aligned to perform well for stakers. Joining as a node operator is fully permissionless and requires just 16 ETH (instead of the usual 32). A boosted ROI is provided from both operator commission plus RPL rewards. The Rocket Pool team have been in the staking space since its inception in 2016, which gives them a pedigree and track record without peer.","links":"https://www.rocketpool.net","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/rocket-pool/logo.png"}
