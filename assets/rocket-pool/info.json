{"name":"Rocket Pool","id":"rocket-pool","symbol":"rpl","description":"Rocket Pool is Ethereumâ€™s most decentralised liquid staking protocol. Liquid stakers can participate by depositing as little as 0.01 ETH to receive the rETH liquid staking token. Rocket Pool is a fully non-custodial solution, and its node operators are economically-aligned to perform well for stakers. Joining as a node operator is fully permissionless and requires just 16 ETH (instead of the usual 32). A boosted ROI is provided from both operator commission plus RPL rewards. The Rocket Pool team have been in the staking space since its inception in 2016, which gives them a pedigree and track record without peer.","links":"https://www.rocketpool.net","market_cap":255375138,"market_cap_rank":322,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/rocket-pool/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd33526068d116ce69f19a9ee46f0bd304f21a51f"},"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb766039cc6db368759c1e56b79affe831d0cc507"},"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x7205705771547cf79201111b4bd8aaf29467b9ec"}}}
