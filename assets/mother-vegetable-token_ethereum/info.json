{"name":"MOTHER VEGETABLE Token","id":"mother-vegetable-token_ethereum","symbol":"mvt","description":"The MOTHER VEGETABLE PROJECT is an initiative designed to regenerate the Earth and all forms of life through a global network of Mother Vegetable production factories. Inspired by the ancient life form that has existed for 3.5 billion years, these factories use standardized production technology to absorb CO₂ and generate oxygen 24 hours a day, helping purify the atmosphere. Each factory also produces sustainable foods and bioplastics derived from Mother Vegetables, while supporting aquaculture and water purification. The long-term vision is to expand these factories worldwide and develop them into eight related industries—including industrial materials, energy, agriculture, biomass, and FMCG—combining environmental restoration with a scalable and sustainable economic model.","links":"https://mothervegetable.org","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mother-vegetable-token_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x33a4bcb4e941dd13439a8f4f723580927c6d9800","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x33a4bcb4e941dd13439a8f4f723580927c6d9800"}},"is_native":false}
