{"name":"BOOKUSD","id":"bookusd_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"bud","description":"BUD is a decentralized stablecoin designed to maintain a soft peg to the US Dollar. It is the native stablecoin of the BOOKUSD protocol, a borrowing platform deployed on the BNB Chain. Users can mint BUD by depositing BOOK tokens as collateral, enabling access to on-chain liquidity without needing to sell their assets. The BOOKUSD protocol is a fork of Liquity V1, originally built on Ethereum, but modified to use BOOK—an asset native to the BNB Chain—instead of ETH as collateral. The protocol offers interest-free borrowing and operates with a liquidation mechanism based on collateral ratios and stability pools to maintain system health.","links":"https://www.bookusd.com","market_cap":55116,"market_cap_rank":8053,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bookusd/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc28957e946ac244612bcb205c899844cbbcb093d","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xc28957e946ac244612bcb205c899844cbbcb093d"}},"is_native":false}
