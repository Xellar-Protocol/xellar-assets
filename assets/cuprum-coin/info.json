{"name":"Cuprum Coin","id":"cuprum-coin","symbol":"cuc","description":"Cuprum Coin is a commodity coin, i.e. an altcoin built on the basis of the Tezos platform, which has behind it a guarantee of value in a specific rare ultrafine copper powder, one of the most expensive elements in the world, which is primarily used in the aerospace industry and medicine, as well as many others sophisticated industries of the future. The value of the underlying asset is over 60 billion U.S. dollars, and is kept in certified high-security facilities in Germany. CUC is currently classified as a utility coin. Given that ultrafine copper powder does not have an official market and is one of the rare commodities without one, Cuprum Coin is the solution and market creation through blockchain technology. Cuprum Coin is a native blockchain.","links":"https://cuprumcoin.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cuprum-coin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":null}}}
