{"name":"Bario Entertainment System","id":"bario-entertainment-system_base","symbol":"$baes","description":"Onchain indie video game marketplace where players can mint, own, and resell digital games as NFTs. Each sale automatically directs 90% of revenue to the game's creator, aligning incentives between developers and players. Publishing on the platform is permissionless, while discovery on baes.app is curated to ensure quality and safety. Tokenomics: the $BAES token was fair launched on Farcaster with no team allocation, and the team's current ~ 10% holding was accumulated through revenue. Initially used for tipping developers, the token is expanding to support tournaments, game purchases, tipping, and curation across the platform. It also connects to a Farcaster-based infofi layer, with a $BAES leaderboard mini app launching soon to showcase engagement and reputation.","links":"https://baes.so/welcome","market_cap":319708,"market_cap_rank":5223,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bario-entertainment-system_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa9f6d9eca1f803854a13cecad0f21d43e007db07","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xa9f6d9eca1f803854a13cecad0f21d43e007db07"}},"is_native":false}
