{"name":"Oracle Layer2","id":"oracle-layer2","symbol":"oracle","description":"Oracle is an innovative new project that leverages zk rollup and layer 2 technologies to provide fast, secure, and scalable solutions for decentralized applications (dApps) on blockchain platforms. The core aim of Oracle is to enable decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to run more efficiently and cost-effectively, while maintaining the same level of security and trust that users expect from traditional financial institutions. With zk rollup, Oracle is able to bundle multiple transactions into a single transaction, greatly reducing gas fees and improving network efficiency. This allows users to enjoy fast transaction times and lower costs, making it possible for small investors to participate in DeFi and other blockchain-based applications.","links":"https://protocoloracle.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/oracle-layer2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x4de914f49f04c943dbde7e4f8017d08b51ad657c"}}}
