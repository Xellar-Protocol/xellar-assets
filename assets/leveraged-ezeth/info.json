{"name":"Leveraged ezETH","id":"leveraged-ezeth","symbol":"xezeth","description":"The xezETH token, also called leveraged ezETH, is a decentralized, composable leveraged long ezETH futures contract with a low risk of liquidations and 0 funding fee (and in extreme cases, xezETH minters can earn fees). Itâ€™s a token to amplify your gains on a long-term bet on ETH price growth. rUSD is a stablecoin that uses the same mechanism as fxUSD, but with its reserve comprised of only ETH Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRT), starting with Renzo's ezETH. Hence, xezETH was born.","links":"https://fx.aladdin.club/earn/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/leveraged-ezeth/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x2e5a5af7ee900d34bcfb70c47023bf1d6be35cf5"}}}
