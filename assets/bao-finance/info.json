{"name":"Bao Finance","id":"bao-finance","symbol":"bao","description":"Warning: Bao Finance is in alpha, it is unaudited and was originally developed by a one-person self-taught team. While we are in the process of scaling the team, please understand the risks and use this product accordingly. It's like SNX + Aave, but for Uniswap, SushiSwap and Balancer. Rather than re-invent the wheel Bao creates new features for existing protocols. The BAO token acts as a governance token for the fully community run project. It is also backed by the insurance fund where all Bao fees go.","links":"https://bao.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bao-finance/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x374cb8c27130e2c9e04f44303f3c8351b9de61c1"},"energi":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x04cb6ed1d4cef27b2b0d42d628f57ee223d6beee"}}}
