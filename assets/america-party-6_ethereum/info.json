{"name":"America Party","id":"america-party-6_ethereum","symbol":"america","description":"The America Party ($AMERICA) is the first America-themed political meme token launched on the Ethereum blockchain. It is a decentralized, community-led project inspired by the ideals of self-governance, freedom, and unity—without being affiliated with any real-world political entity. $AMERICA has no dev tax, no team wallets, and no VC involvement. The token aims to bring people together under a banner of shared values and humor, using memes and culture as tools for viral growth and digital identity. Built entirely by the people, for the people — this is a project about representation, community ownership, and the meme-powered spirit of America on-chain.","links":"https://americacoinog.io/","market_cap":46983,"market_cap_rank":8304,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/america-party-6_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xe6f2e92dfb7ac55a13b2056fc0b37dbc9fcee733","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xe6f2e92dfb7ac55a13b2056fc0b37dbc9fcee733"}},"is_native":false}
