{"name":"NFT11","id":"nft11","symbol":"nft11","description":"\"Non-Fungible Tournament 11, aka NFT11; a football (soccer) inspired universe where anyone can earn and own a football team, unique down to the last player, made possible through the bleeding edge technology of blockchain. NFT11 is a blockchain-based game, with all transactions executed fairly and transparent on the blockchain. It is our goal to create a series of games based on the same ecosystem to eventually attract a wider userbase. The unique functionality of our in-game assets are a perfect fit of form and function for NFT collectors and game fi investors where collectors and profit hunters have the additional edge of utility of their NFTs such as different tier players, real estate in the form of stadium seats etc. This drives demand of their NFT assets because demand is derived from organic users (players of the game) and other collectors unlike most other NFT assets which lack the former. \"","links":"https://nft11.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nft11/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x73f67ae7f934ff15beabf55a28c2da1eeb9b56ec"}}}
