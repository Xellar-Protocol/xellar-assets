{"name":"Wrapped BTC (DeFiVerse)","id":"wrapped-btc-defiverse","symbol":"wbtc","description":"DeFiVerse is a novel initiative designed to bridge the existing divide between Blockchain Games (BCG) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Built as a layer-2 blockchain on Oasys - a platform specialized for gaming - DeFiVerse integrates these two previously distinct domains. Traditionally, BCG and DeFi have evolved in parallel but separate trajectories, limiting their interaction to basic token exchanges. DeFiVerse disrupts this pattern by initiating the \"fusion of BCG and DeFi\". DeFiVerse encourages the development of decentralized applications (DApps) led by game users, while fostering an ecosystem that remains accessible to existing DeFi users. DeFiVerse is poised to initiate a seismic shift in the realm of decentralized finance within BCG, unlocking its latent potential. Join us on DeFiVerse as we navigate towards a new era of decentralized finance in the gaming universe.","links":"https://defi-verse.org/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wrapped-btc-defiverse/logo.png","detail_platform":{"oasys":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x50c5725949a6f0c72e6c4a641f24049a917db0cb","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/oasys/tokens/0x50c5725949a6f0c72e6c4a641f24049a917db0cb"}}}
