{"name":"R","id":"r","symbol":"r","description":"Raft is a DeFi protocol that lets you generate R by depositing liquid staking tokens (LSDs) as collateral. A capital-efficient way to borrow while keeping your staking rewards. R is the most capital-efficient USD stablecoin backed by liquid staking tokens such as stETH (Lido Staked Ether) and rETH (Rocket Pool ETH), providing the **best way to borrow** against LSD collateral. R aims to be the stablecoin of choice within the decentralized ecosystem, with deep liquidity across many trading pairs and a stable peg. To keep a tight and stable peg to the US dollar, Raft uses a combination of both hard and soft peg mechanisms.","links":"https://www.raft.fi/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/r/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x183015a9ba6ff60230fdeadc3f43b3d788b13e21"},"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xafb2820316e7bc5ef78d295ab9b8bb2257534576"}}}
