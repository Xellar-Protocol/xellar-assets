{"name":"GMT Token","id":"gmt-token","symbol":"gmt","description":"A token backed by real assets that brings in constantly growing daily BTC income to its owner. Each GMT is backed by real computing power (TH/s) via the SHA-256 protocol. Tokens issued via a smart contract of the Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) blockchain platforms. The initial issue was 100,000,000 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain platform, which are backed by 100,000 TH/s. 1 GMT = 0,001 TH/s. According to the development strategy, the team will constantly introduce additional capacities and carry out additional emissions of the GMT token. Our primary objective is to bring the number of tokens in circulation up to 10,000,000,000 GMT. Following each additional emission, the team activates the mechanism of burning 20-100% of new tokens, which leads to an increase in the profitability of GMT. As a result of the burning, the released computing power is redistributed among all GMTs in circulation, increasing the computing power that provides tokens. Hence, it increases mining income. Supply capacity for 1 GMT will grow steadily, followed by an increase in token holdersâ€™ incomes. The whole process may become more profitable than traditional mining. Thus, a constant fundamental growth of the token means a constant increase in its price is already embedded at its core. GMT token is: - A quick investment starter in BTC mining. - The ability to exit quickly and fix profits through the sale of the token. - Double profitability for investment protection.","links":"https://gmt.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gmt-token/logo.png"}
