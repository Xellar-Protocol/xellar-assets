{"name":"Asymetrix","id":"asymetrix","symbol":"asx","description":"What is the project about? * Decentralized, non-custodial protocol for asymmetric distribution of yield generated from staking. The team was inspired by the concept of Premium Bonds from the UK, and has adopted its core mechanics. This idea is a perfect fit for the crypto industry, as it utilizes fully transparent and auditable smart contracts. What makes your project unique? * Our protocol is a new tool for the liquid staking market. Instead of the anticipated small returns from staking ETH, users have the opportunity to earn a much higher APR through a random profit distribution generated by all protocol participants staked ETH (asymmetric distribution). History of your project. * The project development began in stealth mode towards the end of 2022. At this point, the protocol has already completed its beta stage and is now fully operational on the Ethereum mainnet. Just prior to deployment on the mainnet, the protocol successfully passed an audit by Hacken. Whatâ€™s next for your project? * We are constantly working on security, which is why we will be launching a Bug Bounty program in the near future, where anyone interested can participate and receive significant rewards. Currently, we are focused on expanding our community (the number of protocol participants), launching a DAO, and implementing further ideas related to the protocol's mechanics. What can your token be used for? * ASX token is a community token, the main utility is governance participation.","links":"https://asymetrix.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/asymetrix/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x67d85a291fcdc862a78812a3c26d55e28ffb2701"}}}
