{"name":"Toyow","id":"toyow-token_base","symbol":"ttn","description":"The Toyow Project is a tokenized Real-World Asset (RWA) platform designed to enable fractional ownership and trading of high-value assets such as art, music, movies, real estate, and classic cars. Its native utility token, TOYOW, powers transactions, rewards, exclusive access, and community engagement. Toyow aims to democratize access to traditionally exclusive investment opportunities by solving key Web3 barriers like lack of trust, accessibility, knowledge, and liquidity. The platform allows users to invest using fiat or crypto, ensuring secure, compliant, and instant settlements. Backed by strategic partnerships (e.g., Hindustan Times, Virgin Music, Brinc), it positions itself as a multi-category global marketplace for RWA tokenization. The project leverages the Base (Coinbase Layer 2) network for scalability and low-cost transactions. Its tokenomics includes a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens, staking rewards, a buy-and-burn mechanism to drive long-term value, and tiered benefits for holders. Through this model, Toyow intends to reshape how people access and invest in high-value assets.","links":"https://www.toyowtoken.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/toyow-token_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x225530e4afcdb5eccb96af7a45d94452a10a3879","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x225530e4afcdb5eccb96af7a45d94452a10a3879"}},"is_native":false}
