{"name":"Newton","id":"newton","symbol":"ntn","description":"Autonity is an EVM-based, public blockchain designed as decentralised infrastructure for borderless markets. Borderless markets are by definition markets with participants in multiple currency areas who are subject to unwanted foreign exchange risk. Autonity's utility coin — Auton — combines innovation in unit-of-account and stabilisation mechanism design to explicitly address this foundational concern so that builders can develop new markets without the limitations of fiat-pegged stablecoins. Autonity uses delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism with the Newton as the staking token. Users get node flavored Liquid Newtons in exchange for their delegated stake. The project is in the early testnet stage and is being developed by a community that is passionate about the potential social benefits of monetary and market structure innovation.","links":"https://autonity.org/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/newton/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
