{"name":"OASIS","id":"oasis-2","symbol":"xos","description":"Inside the OASIS you’ll find an ever-growing community, utilizing a decentralized governance structure to decide how the protocol evolves by decisions and proposals from holders of XOS, voted upon by those that secure the network via OASIS nodes. The User Created Asset Network (UCAN) will allow you to create and destroy NFT’s (Non-Fungible Tokens) the way you see fit. Created a unique piece of art? An audio clip? An animation? All three in one? 'Compose' it. Trade it. Sell it. Distribute it. Decide to make a collection even more rare? Burn it. Or, 'Dispose' it & receive XOS back to do it all over again. It’s simple . . . if you have an idea, a suggestion, or a desire to see something implemented, get the support of the community and participate in the growth of OASIS. We envision a future, together in the OASIS.","links":"https://oasisco.in","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/oasis-2/logo.png"}
