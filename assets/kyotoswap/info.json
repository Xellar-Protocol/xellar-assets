{"name":"KyotoSwap","id":"kyotoswap","symbol":"kswap","description":"KyotoSwap.io is a traditional Uniswap V2 Automated Market Maker fork that upholds the tried-and-true AMM model. Our focus is on refining the decentralized exchange experience for our users and offer something new by integrating the ReFi (Regenerative Finance) model into our core vision and workings. The ReFi model sets our platform apart from other DEXs, and we do it by incorporating environmental sustainability into the DeFi experience. Our Impact feature enables users to plant trees and rank on the Impact Leaderboard, giving users a competitive surrounding for their tree-planting actions. For those that want more exposure and visibility, we offer the possibility of naming their wallets so you can make everyone know who the top planter and good-doer on the Leaderboard is, offering a unique marketing opportunity within the Kyoto ecosystem. Our native token is the KyotoSwap token (KSWAP), which serves as the platform's share and governance token. Another unique value proposition is that KSWAP farming on KyotoSwap.io can be done with zero risk of impermanent loss to your holdings using our stable coin farm, and tokens accrued can be used to plant trees while ranking on our Leaderboard. The above approach makes it a unique marketing opportunity and free with minimum risk to our users.","links":"https://www.kyotoswap.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kyotoswap/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x29abc4d03d133d8fd1f1c54318428353ce08727e"}}}
