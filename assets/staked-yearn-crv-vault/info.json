This system is composed of a base-token called yCRV which a user can deposit into any one of three `activated` positons to earn yield or voting power: st-yCRV, lp-yCRV, and vl-yCRV. st-yCRV yVault receives admin fees and bribes from locked CRV. lp-yCRV yVault converts yCRV into CRV/yCRV LP tokens and uses them to farm CRV emissions and trading fees. vl-yCRV yVault is for voting power on Curve.fi gauge weights.","links":"https://yearn.finance/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/staked-yearn-crv-vault/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x27b5739e22ad9033bcbf192059122d163b60349d","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x27b5739e22ad9033bcbf192059122d163b60349d"}}}
