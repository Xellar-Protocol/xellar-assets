{"name":"Staked Yearn CRV Vault","id":"staked-yearn-crv-vault","symbol":"st-ycrv","description":"yCRV is Yearn Finance's new and improved veCRV wrapper system designed to tokenize Yearn's veCRV position which passes all revenue and benefits along to users. This system is composed of a base-token called yCRV which a user can deposit into any one of three `activated` positons to earn yield or voting power: st-yCRV, lp-yCRV, and vl-yCRV. st-yCRV yVault receives admin fees and bribes from locked CRV. lp-yCRV yVault converts yCRV into CRV/yCRV LP tokens and uses them to farm CRV emissions and trading fees. vl-yCRV yVault is for voting power on Curve.fi gauge weights.","links":"https://yearn.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/staked-yearn-crv-vault/logo.png"}
