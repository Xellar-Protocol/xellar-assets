{"name":"Master CEO","id":"master-ceo","symbol":"mceo","description":"By providing practical utilities powered by their utility token, $MCEO, MasterCEO is a DeFi initiative that seeks to use community power and unite the sector. The project's primary goals are to highlight real use cases and raise money to replenish the ecosystem and support the $MCEO coin. To do this, MasterCEO provides a number of services, such as MasterClasses, NFT Collections, and a swap, all of which bring in money for the project. MasterClasses is a fee-based bot where users may sign up for AMAs and watch videos from various producers who teach different skills by paying with bitcoins. To achieve success, the initiative intends to work in collaboration with developers, influencers, and other parties. All proceeds from ticket sales and partnerships will be used to repurchase and burn $MCEO. The NFT Collections, which are offered in mystery boxes filled with various rarities and can be sold back to the initiative, are devoted to the great CEOs of our time. The NFT Collections' earnings will also be used to repurchase and burn $MCEO. Additionally, the project has already finished a functioning bridge and a swap, both of which are publicly accessible on their website and may increase the liquidity and usability of the $MCEO token.","links":"https://www.masterceo.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/master-ceo/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x07b7ddf2257f633fed7dc97129edac9e519af172"}}}
