{"name":"Legacy Media Killer","id":"legacy-media-killer","symbol":"x","description":"In a world dominated by biased narratives and agenda-driven journalism, the Legacy Media Killer (LMK) project emerges as a crypto-based solution aiming to bring transparency, freedom of information, and decentralization to news. LMK challenges traditional media outlets, often accused of spreading misinformation, by providing a platform where users can access and verify unbiased content directly. Here’s how it works: Key Features of Legacy Media Killer Decentralized News Verification LMK leverages blockchain technology to validate news sources. Through decentralized verification, users are incentivized to report, vet, and rate content based on accuracy, transparency, and neutrality. Each piece of content is rated and stored on an immutable ledger, ensuring that once a story is verified, it can’t be altered or manipulated. Tokenized Incentives The LMK ecosystem operates with its native token, $LMK. Users who contribute by fact-checking, reporting unbiased news, or flagging misinformation are rewarded with $LMK. The token incentivizes honest participation, rewarding those who contribute to the quality and reliability of the information on the platform.","links":"https://www.legacymediakiller.com/","market_cap":52384,"market_cap_rank":6707,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/legacy-media-killer/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"3KAeVfDbU6tZxSD2kqz3Pz6B6f42CW3FdA89GUZ8fw23"}}}
