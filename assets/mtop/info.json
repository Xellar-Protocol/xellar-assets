{"name":"MTOP","id":"mtop","symbol":"mtop","description":"MtopSwap is developing a suite of innovative software focused on user-friendly DeFi trading. We offer a completely unique multi-swap aggregator that allows users to view & trade on 100+ different DEXes simultaneously on simple swap \"modules\" that can be added, customized, & organized. We are a software-as-a-service (SaaS), utilizing NFTs as recurring subscriptions for access to our software tools. Recurring subscriptions have proven to be a successful revenue model for decades and we saw an opportunity to introduce this revenue model to blockchain while pushing the boundaries of what NFTs can do. MtopSwap will continuously develop features to our multi-swap aggregator over the coming years, including price charts, portfolio management, and a 1-click due diligence check for any token in any ecosystem. The end goal is to reduce the barrier of entry for DeFi newcomers and bring together a fragmented layer-1 blockchain space by eventually aggregating all EVM-compatible chains.","links":"https://app.mtopswap.one/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mtop/logo.png","detail_platform":{"harmony-shard-0":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x4a986bb7909d361f3191ea08d0c4b328295841a4"}}}
