{"name":"GAIB","id":"gaib_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"gaib","description":"GAIB is the world’s first economic layer for AI infrastructure, transforming real-world AI assets—GPUs, robotics, and AI energy systems—into tradable, reward-bearing onchain instruments. By bridging decentralized finance (DeFi) liquidity with AI infrastructure assets, GAIB unlocks a trillion-dollar opportunity at the intersection of AI, Robotics, RWA & DeFi. AID is the first product built on GAIB’s economic layer, designed as a synthetic dollar fully backed by the U.S. treasury and stable assets. While sAID (staked AID) is the receipt token issued when AID is staked into GAIB’s ERC-4626 vaults, representing the proportional ownership in GAIB’s diversified portfolio of real-world AI compute infra & Robotics financing deals and a reserve of treasury bills. Through sAID, investors gain direct exposure to real-world AI infra with sustainable AI-driven yields, while preserving liquidity to enable broader participation across DeFi markets. The name GAIB is inspired not only by the movie Dune, which means “the unseen or the future”, but also by the three pillars we focus on: GPU, AI & Blockchain. Compute is the new currency and GPUs are a new asset class in the AI era, GAIB is liberating the trillion-dollar AI assets market to all.","links":"https://gaib.ai/","market_cap":8863587,"market_cap_rank":1646,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gaib/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc19d38925f9f645337b1d1f37baf3c0647a48e50","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xc19d38925f9f645337b1d1f37baf3c0647a48e50"}},"is_native":false}
