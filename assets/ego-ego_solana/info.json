{"name":"Ego Ego","id":"ego-ego_solana","symbol":"ego","description":"Ego is a protocol for launching and trading tokens linked to any profile on the Internet (i.e. X, YouTube, TikTok). The value of each token is determined by the profile’s public perception, influence, real-world achievements, and the community. Ego solves key challenges that creator tokens face via token legitimacy, standardized distribution methods, brand safety features, and long-term incentive alignment. Token launches are fully permissionless, enabling viral market dynamics and communities to develop around any social profile.","links":"https://www.ego.tech/","market_cap":483398,"market_cap_rank":4654,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ego-ego_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"egoS1kE1g4JuExTcvG6bB6cg5LWpACQ469uk6DTMuJq","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/egoS1kE1g4JuExTcvG6bB6cg5LWpACQ469uk6DTMuJq"}},"is_native":false}
