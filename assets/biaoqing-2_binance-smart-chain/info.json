{"name":"Biaoqing","id":"biaoqing-2_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"$biao","description":"Biaoqing (Biao) is a meme deeply rooted in Chinese and Asian internet culture. The meme is centred around a blank panda face, and has been used for many year to give a form of expression and communication via memes on popular Chinese online forums. This project pays homage to the Biaoqiing, and we believe it has potential to be one of the largest and most popular tokens in the space, due to its widespread appeal. We believe the token will appeal to both Eastern and Western Cultures equally, especially at this current time when the Eastern driven BNB chain is enjoying a surge in popularity and volume.","links":"https://biaoqingbsc.com","market_cap":57388,"market_cap_rank":7995,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/biaoqing-2_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xdc280afcd08e61be78ca8d154f78ef0bfea6deac","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xdc280afcd08e61be78ca8d154f78ef0bfea6deac"}},"is_native":false}
