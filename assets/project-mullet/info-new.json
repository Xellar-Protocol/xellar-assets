{"name":"Project Mullet","id":"project-mullet","symbol":"mullet","description":"What is the project about? Project Mullet combines the most iconic hairstyle with unique built-in game theory rewards to create a culture that cultivates creativity and individuality. What makes your project unique? We built a model that utilizes high levels of game theory to making decisions on whether or not to claim earned ETH rewards and how/when to take profit from your MULLET tokens. Holders are free to trade their MULLET as they see fit, but transferring MULLET out of their wallet or selling will forfeit any unclaimed ETH rewards to all other holders. Additionally, if a user claims their ETH rewards their MULLET tokens will become locked in their wallet until a small set of criteria are met (minimum time has passed and minimum new unclaimed rewards have been accumulated). Finally, a locked holder can instantly unlock their MULLET by paying back their most recent rewards claim which is then distributed to all other MULLET holders. History of your project. Launched today, June 5th Whatâ€™s next for your project? Onboarding new investors, expanding exposure. What can your token be used for? Trading $MULLET generates liquidity fees that are continuously & automatically withdrawn and deposited into a game theory ETH rewards pool. Each $MULLET holder accumulates their share of ETH rewards proportional to their holdings of the reward-eligible supply.","links":"https://projectmullet.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/project-mullet/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x7a569bff9f87b526b39331ca870516c1d93c0fda"}}}
