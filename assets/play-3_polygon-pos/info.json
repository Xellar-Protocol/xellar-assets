{"name":"Play","id":"play-3_polygon-pos","symbol":"play","description":"LuxPlay is a fully on-chain iGaming ecosystem on Polygon focused on transparent, provably fair gameplay. Current titles include BullsEye and CloseCall (BTC price-prediction games), with additional games such as SlotLux, LuxBingo and LuxPoker in development. Game rules, prize pools and payouts are enforced by smart contracts; outcomes are verifiable on-chain. For randomness-based titles LuxPlay integrates Chainlink VRF, and for price-settlement it uses Chainlink Price Feeds. Rounds and prize distribution are automated via on-chain logic for predictable operation. $PLAY is the ecosystem’s utility token used for gameplay, fees and access to features across LuxPlay titles. Contracts programmatically split gameplay fees to prize pools, referral rewards and designated operations wallets, with addresses and parameters visible on-chain for auditability. LuxPlay is product-first (no investment promises), non-custodial, and designed so anyone can independently verify results, balances and distributions directly from the blockchain.","links":"https://www.luxplay.io/","market_cap":11743328,"market_cap_rank":1446,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/play-3_polygon-pos/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x1cca311b786dd7906c07414095fa719eabfd070f","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/polygon_pos/tokens/0x1cca311b786dd7906c07414095fa719eabfd070f"}},"is_native":false}
