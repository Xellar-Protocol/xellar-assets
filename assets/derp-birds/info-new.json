{"name":"Derp Birds","id":"derp-birds","symbol":"derp","description":"The $DERP token will serve as the utility token for the Derp Birds project. Players will earn $DERP through staking (holding) their Derp NFTs, unlocking achievements, engaging with the community, and as rewards for participating throughout the various roadmap features of the project. The NFT community is diverse and each collector is looking for something different from the NFTs they collect. As such, the initial and future uses for $DERP fall into two primary categories to ensure that a broader range of collectors benefit from earning $DERP. The two categories for $DERP uses are: Gamified/roadmap specific Uses related to the gamified roadmap features such as the PRED Armory, Faction Wars, unlocking new character slots, etc. Utility specific Uses not directly tied to the gamified roadmap features of the Derp Birds project such as the raffle system, possible utility linked to our own minting technology, and uses associated with other Cardano NFT projects.","links":"https://links.derpbirds.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/derp-birds/logo.png","detail_platform":{"cardano":{"decimal_place":0,"contract_address":"961f2cac0bb1967d74691af179350c1e1062c7298d1f7be1e4696e312444455250"}}}
