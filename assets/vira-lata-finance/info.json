{"name":"Vira-Lata Finance","id":"vira-lata-finance","symbol":"reau","description":"\"Viralata Finance ($REAU) is a decentralized, open source project introducing Brazilians to the world of cryptocurrency by providing a safe and easy-to-use set of apps, with a charitable twist. Its goals are to encourage and empower Brazilians to take their finances into their own hands; demonstrate the potential of alternative financial solutions; provide services to markets that are largely overlooked and under served in Brazil such as micro and small capital businesses, freelancers; and extend a helping hand to the stray dog population that served as inspiration for this project. Since its creation on March 21, 2021, the Vira-lata Finance community has already helped several non-governmental organizations and persons that provide animal welfare and take care of abandoned animals, by donating more than $10,000 to these NGOs.","links":"https://viralata.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/vira-lata-finance/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x4c79b8c9cb0bd62b047880603a9decf36de28344"}}}
