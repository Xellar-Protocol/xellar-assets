{"name":"M","id":"m","symbol":"m","description":"Purpose: The Rug Game is an antidote and a cure for degeneracy. We are weaning ourselves away from supporting scam developers that may or may not rug pull you. And instead we are playing the game on our own terms. We know the risks, we know the rewards, and we are free to play, free to win and free to lose. Function: $M to serve as one of the 10 gaming tokens for The Rug Game Utility: By holding $M, one is entitled to a share of the 1% tax that is collected by the buying/selling of the all gaming tokens after 30-60 days when one of the gaming tokens rugs (as long as it's not $M) All of the 10 gaming tokens have a 4% tax. 1% buys and burns CULT, 1% which buys & burns TRG, 1% game token sent to burn wallet & 1% which is collected by a contract & held in ETH. Any wallet that holds TRG or CULT can offer a bribe to the DAO. If a wallet sacrifices their TRG or CULT, they can allocate that amount of “points” to a game token of their choosing. 50% of the bribe is then paid to TRG or CULT stakers dependent on token offered whilst 50% is burned. A gaming token is rugged after 30-60 days if it has the least amount of points. This process repeats until there is only one gaming token left.","links":"https://theruggame.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/m/logo.png"}
