{"name":"Clickme","id":"clickme_solana","symbol":"clickme","description":"Clickme is a decentralized gambling platform built on the Solana blockchain, introducing a high-adrenaline game of timing, risk, and reward. At its core, the platform revolves around a single, compelling mechanic: a button that users can click by spending a small amount of SOL. Every time a player clicks the button, the game timer resets. If the timer runs out without another click, the last person to click the button claims the entire pot of accumulated SOL. This simple yet addictive format creates a game theory-driven battleground where players must balance timing and strategy, knowing that every click brings them closer to a potential win—or a loss if someone outlasts them. The game is transparent, provably fair, and fully on-chain, leveraging Solana’s lightning-fast transactions and low fees to offer seamless, real-time interaction. Clickme caters to both casual participants and high-stakes thrill-seekers, combining the excitement of last-man-standing gameplay with the transparency and security of decentralized finance. With a sleek UI and robust smart contract foundation, the platform aims to redefine blockchain-based gaming and introduce a new wave of interactive crypto entertainment.","links":"https://click-me.io/","market_cap":68998,"market_cap_rank":7660,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/clickme/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"Dh69esKUndpk3yAG2Cg4VHMfYLaAHSeu6kuLRGv7pump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/Dh69esKUndpk3yAG2Cg4VHMfYLaAHSeu6kuLRGv7pump"}},"is_native":false}
