{"name":"AITV","id":"agentcoin-tv_base","symbol":"aitv","description":"AITV is a media infrastructure project that develops autonomous, AI-driven livestreaming agents. The platform enables creators, brands, and communities to design and deploy agents that can host or co-host livestreams, interact with audiences in real time, and operate within configurable tokenized economies. Its functionality includes producer dashboards for managing streams, customizable agent studios for tailoring appearance and behavior, and an API for integrating agents into third-party platforms such as YouTube or Twitch. Governance and platform development are managed through the AITV DAO, using token-weighted voting. The project’s utility lies in providing tools for agent-based media creation, interactive viewership, and decentralized economic participation.","links":"https://aitv.gg","market_cap":3874830,"market_cap_rank":2298,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/agentcoin-tv_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x45e4e92f5a94f4b741c9cb553ff8be7b25eb7df5","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x45e4e92f5a94f4b741c9cb553ff8be7b25eb7df5"}},"is_native":false}
