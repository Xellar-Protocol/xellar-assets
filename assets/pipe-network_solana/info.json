{"name":"Pipe Network","id":"pipe-network_solana","symbol":"pipe","description":"Pipe Network is a decentralized edge supercloud that integrates content delivery (CDN), storage, and AI inference into one permissionless infrastructure. The project’s goal is to solve the inefficiencies of traditional CDNs and centralized cloud providers by moving content and compute closer to end users through hyperlocal Points of Presence (PoPs). Unlike conventional networks owned by large operators, Pipe enables community-run nodes deployed within ~50 miles of users. This reduces latency to the single-digit millisecond range, improves throughput, and lowers delivery costs by up to 100×. The system is coordinated through smart contracts on Solana, which verify proof-of-delivery, manage node reputation, and automate payments. The PIPE utility token powers bandwidth, storage, and compute credits, using a burn-to-credit model that ties token demand directly to real network usage. With more than 60 PB of data delivered and over 1 billion files transferred, Pipe Network demonstrates that decentralized infrastructure can achieve enterprise-grade performance while scaling globally in a transparent and open way.","links":"https://pipe.network/","market_cap":5961062,"market_cap_rank":1948,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pipe-network/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"7s9MoSt7VV1J3jVNnw2AyocsQDBdCkPYz5apQDPKy9i5","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/7s9MoSt7VV1J3jVNnw2AyocsQDBdCkPYz5apQDPKy9i5"}},"is_native":false}
