{"name":"FLEABONE","id":"fleabone","symbol":"bone","description":"The only original Matt Furie animated show in existence… grab a piece of this BILLION DOLLAR DOG! In 2015 Matt Furie gathered a group of artists to pitch a new animated show to the networks. It was ultimately rejected it & labeled a failure… but does this look like a failure to you? Watch the pilot & let’s breath life back into this trashy carnie world. This breakdancing dog is always down to party but is longing from something more in life. Torn between degening the f out with his pal Slippy or upleveling his game to win the heart of the bombshell Babygirl, he’s finding his way in the Doble Fried universe. But what will happen next? Grab a bag of our tribute token so that we can help sponsor the next episode.","links":"https://fleabone.com/","market_cap":10181311,"market_cap_rank":1801,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/fleabone/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x7076de6ff1d91e00be7e92458089c833de99e22e"}}}
