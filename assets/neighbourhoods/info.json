{"name":"Neighbourhoods","id":"neighbourhoods","symbol":"nht","description":"On the legacy web, platforms reign. They dictate who we engage with, what we can discover, and how we're known. On the early-stage distributed web, tons of little features and functionalities are disconnected and difficult to use. Neighbourhoods is a social organizing principle for the distributed web. Bundle totally interoperable, generic tools in our marketplace. Then, pair these with intentional culture design suited to your community. Determine entry and exit rules, how engagement operates in the neighbourhood, and which other neighbourhoods you want to be able to share data with. Using Neighbourhoods, individuals move about the dWeb more freely, with peer-validated data in tow, and groups can scale organically without their activities mediated and monetized by platform owners. The Neighbourhoods Token (NHT) serves as the on-ramp into, and out of, the low-code marketplace that communities use to build their micro-networks.","links":"https://neighbourhoods.network","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/neighbourhoods/logo.png"}
