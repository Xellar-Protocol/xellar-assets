{"name":"The Bear","id":"the-bear","symbol":"bear","description":"What is the project about? $BEAR is a ERC20 token designed to encapsulate the essence of the bear, one of the most iconic symbols in the financial world. With the bear market being a term often used to describe a period of declining asset prices, BEAR is a playful token that aims to capture the spirit of these challenging times. Bears are known for their strength and resilience. They hybernate through tough times, emerging stronger when conditions improve. $BEAR seeks to embody this spirit by providing a token that represents holding steady in the face of market volatility. What makes your project unique? $BEAR was created as a ERC20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain, by a individual who's had years of experience in the scene. The initial self-provided liquidity by the developer was a wobling 50 ETH, making it a very unique token since not a lot of people do this. 95% of the supply was added towards this pool, and investors have to pay no transaction fees to be a part of $BEAR.","links":"https://www.the-bear.fund/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/the-bear/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x4bc2213ee6c99dc38099690603f044980a4f5dba"}}}
