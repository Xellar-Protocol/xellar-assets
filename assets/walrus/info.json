{"name":"Walrus","id":"walrus","symbol":"wlrs","description":"Frozen Walrus Finance is an algorithmic stable coin protocol pegged 1:1 to USDC on Avalanche via seigniorage. The protocol's underlying mechanism dynamically adjusts WLRS's supply, pushing its price up or down in relation to the price of USDC. This should be $1 however there may be times where USDC loses its peg and if our protocol is functioning as intended will follow USDC to keep pegged 1:1 to it.","links":"https://frozenwalrus.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/walrus/logo.png","detail_platform":{"avalanche":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x395908aeb53d33a9b8ac35e148e9805d34a555d3"}}}
