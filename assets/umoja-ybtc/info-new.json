{"name":"Umoja yBTC","id":"umoja-ybtc","symbol":"ybtc","description":"Umoja is a next-gen liquid staking protocol introducing the world's highest yield, lowest risk BTC LST, $yBTC. $yBTC is BTC-principal protected, 1:1 backed by BTC, and earns a yield of 5% to 10% - all in BTC. Traditional assets, including all crypto, fiat currencies, and otherwise, cannot self-manage risks or yields. If the market takes a turn for the worse, so does the asset's value. Even during bull-runs, such assets are unable to optimize their own returns, leaving retail investors at a massive disadvantage in contrast to their whale and institutional investor counterparts, who leverage asset managers and automated trading strategies to get ahead. In contrast, Smartcoins are AI-driven, equipped with quant & DeFi-native trading strategies that proactively enhance holder returns.","links":"https://umoja.xyz/ybtc","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/umoja-ybtc/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":null}}}
