{"name":"Umoja yBTC","id":"umoja-ybtc","symbol":"ybtc","description":"Umoja is an asset creation protocol that provides effortless, low-risk, high-yield crypto for everyone. Traditional assets, including all crypto, fiat currencies, and otherwise, cannot self-manage risks or yields. If the market takes a turn for the worse, so does the asset's value. Even during bull-runs, such assets are unable to optimize their own returns, leaving retail investors at a massive disadvantage in contrast to their whale and institutional investor counterparts, who leverage asset managers and automated trading strategies to get ahead. In contrast, Smartcoins are AI-driven, equipped with quant & DeFi-native trading strategies that proactively enhance holder returns.","links":"https://www.umoja.xyz","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/umoja-ybtc/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":null}}}
