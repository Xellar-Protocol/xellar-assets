{"name":"Jefe","id":"jefe","symbol":"jefe","description":"Jefe is a crypto project that focuses on video games where players can earn money. Also, the team supports real heroes around the world, such as soldiers, police officers, veterans, firefighters, and doctors. Apart from that, the startup issued special NFTs with limited editions. So, people could use these nonfungible tokens to earn more rewards on Jefe’s gaming platform. For example, such tokenized game cards can unlock certain levels in the upcoming games. Thanks to the staff of developers, highly experienced in the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), the startup provides a transparent solution to token-holders and consumers of games’ players through play-2-earn video games and NFT. JEFE is the FTM token with a 5% tax rate. As a result, the token’s protocol takes five percent from each transaction and reallocates it. 2% automatically goes to all existing token-holders. Then, 1% goes to the liquidity on DEX. The rest, 2%, goes to the vault dedicated to buybacks. This vault performs regular buybacks to reduce the number of coins in circulation. Therefore $JEFE price could be more stable in times of the bear market. Also, the team aims to launch a native NFT Marketplace in 2022.","links":"https://www.jefetoken.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/jefe/logo.png"}
