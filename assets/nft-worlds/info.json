{"name":"NFT Worlds","id":"nft-worlds","symbol":"wrld","description":"$WRLD is an ERC-20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain. It is the primary utility token and the token used when playing in an NFT World. Players will be able to use $WRLD tokens to access exclusive experiences, items, perks, content and more within NFT Worlds. These tokens will be given to the owner of a world a player is playing in, in exchange for the specific experience, items, perks, content, etc as promised by the world owner for a token transaction. These transactions will happen through an in-game UI connected to the blockchain. Weâ€™ve created the integration of the $WRLD token with NFT Worlds in such a way that nearly any in-game experience, perk, item or access to content can be created by world owners and require $WRLD tokens from players in their worlds in order to access or participate in such content. Additionally, $WRLD will be required for purchasing optional, custom NFT World character NFTs, and may sometimes be required for unannounced global NFT Worlds perks and content in the future.","links":"https://www.nftworlds.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nft-worlds/logo.png"}
