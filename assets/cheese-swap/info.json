{"name":"Cheese Swap","id":"cheese-swap","symbol":"cheese","description":"CheeseSwap is a system that offers a multitude of CRYPTO products or services to its customers, ONE-STOP Crypto Solution. The concept of a one-stop solution dates back to early 20th-century when a shopping trip could mean going all over town to pick up meat from the butchers, vegetables from the market, bread from the bakery and that was just for goodstuffs. Hardware supplies, cleaning supplies, and other household items required even more visits to even more places. Then, as now, people wanted to save time, so stores responded by stocking a wider range of products so that customers only had to come to their location to check off the majority of their shopping lists. CheeseSwap can refer to a literal roof a specific place where all the business a client has can be carried out or it can refer to a system that handles a variety of products or services. Compared to visiting a separate system for each area of need, CheeseSwap saves the consumer time, effort and money.","links":"https://cheeseswap.network/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cheese-swap/logo.png"}
