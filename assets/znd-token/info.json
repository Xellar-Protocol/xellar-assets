{"name":"ZND Token","id":"znd-token","symbol":"znd","description":"ZND is a comprehensive financial ecosystem comprised of various platforms, each tailored to distinct target groups. The foundation of this ecosystem is zondacrypto, a cryptocurrency exchange launched in 2014, which has since become one of the largest in Central Europe. Another significant platform within the ZND ecosystem is zondacrypto Pay, a payment processor that enables entrepreneurs, marketplaces, and platforms to accept cryptocurrency payments for their goods and services. The most recent addition to the ecosystem, launched in December 2023, is the ZND platform, an innovative digital asset management solution created in collaboration with ICEO Venture Builder and Zondacrypto. It focuses on four essential pillars for users engaged in the cryptocurrency market: Trade, Earn, Borrow, and Explore. The platform is designed with simplicity in mind, allowing even those with minimal experience to easily navigate and participate in trading and other activities. At the core of this ecosystem is the ZND Token, which functions as the primary settlement unit across all platforms. The token represents trust and loyalty within the community, serving as a reward for key engagement mechanisms throughout the ecosystem. The ZND Token is a versatile asset within the ZND ecosystem, offering multiple utilities that enhance user engagement and market stability. In the \"Earn\" service, users can lock their crypto assets like BTC or ETH and choose to receive rewards in $ZND, with flexible reward structures giving up to 20% $ZND additional bonus. This farming mechanism offers a seamless way to accumulate $ZND without direct market purchases, increasing demand for the token. The Staking Program allows users to freeze $ZND for long-term rewards, offering high APRs, loyalty-based benefits, and early withdrawal options with penalty fees. This program withdraws significant $ZND from circulation, contributing to market stability. The Loyalty Program encourages platform activity by offering exclusive rewards, such as special pool bonuses filled from penalty fees and trading costs. Loyalty tiers unlock greater perks, fostering deeper community engagement. Finally, the Token Burning mechanism ensures $ZND remains a deflationary asset, with periodic burns reducing the token supply and supporting long-term growth.","links":"https://znd.co/","market_cap":26107111,"market_cap_rank":1219,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/znd-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x2d8ea194902bc55431420bd26be92b0782dce91d"}}}
