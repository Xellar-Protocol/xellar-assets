{"name":"Bitz","id":"bitz-3_polygon-pos","symbol":"bitz","description":"DestinyDAO is a decentralized payment ecosystem built on Polygon, designed to make cryptocurrency usable in daily life through its native token, BITZ. The project operates in two technical phases: the first, a controlled distribution phase (Prize Program), encourages adoption and liquidity under a fully deflationary model with 100% token burn on entry. The second, known as BitzPay, introduces a real peer-to-peer and Point-of-Sale (POS) payment network where users and merchants can transact with BITZ directly. The system gradually shifts from promotional yields to Proof of Stake rewards based on real transaction volume, creating a sustainable link between blockchain technology and practical financial utility.","links":"https://tokenbitz.info/","market_cap":34418,"market_cap_rank":8782,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bitz-3_polygon-pos/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x9c6605eeb66bd05858e0cb5204432aa6c7d0fa24","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/polygon_pos/tokens/0x9c6605eeb66bd05858e0cb5204432aa6c7d0fa24"}},"is_native":false}
