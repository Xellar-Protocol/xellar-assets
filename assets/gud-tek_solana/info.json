{"name":"GUD TEK","id":"gud-tek_solana","symbol":"gudtek","description":"Gud Tek ($GUDTEK) is a community-driven SPL token launched on June 6, 2025, as the first-ever token through the BONK Hackathon's official \"Bonk Launch\" platform (https://hackathon.letsbonk.fun). With a permanently capped supply of 1 billion tokens, no taxes, and no promised utilities, the token focuses entirely on community engagement and transparent experimentation within the Solana ecosystem. The initial liquidity provided on Raydium was fully burned, ensuring long-term stability and transparency. Gud Tek emphasizes grassroots participation, meme-driven culture, and open-source community development.","links":"https://gudtek.club","market_cap":4325.22,"market_cap_rank":12544,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gud-tek/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"5QUgMieD3YQr9sEZjMAHKs1cKJiEhnvRNZatvzvcbonk","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/5QUgMieD3YQr9sEZjMAHKs1cKJiEhnvRNZatvzvcbonk"}},"is_native":false}
