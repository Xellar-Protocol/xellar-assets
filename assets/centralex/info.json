{"name":"Centralex","id":"centralex","symbol":"cenx","description":"Our foundation started at using an ERC-20 tokens, Some of the utilities include Discounted trading fees and Access to specialised services launched on the Centralex platform additional features worth mentioning are our Staking and Governance mechanisms as well as our unique Cen-Split Rewards program. Custo-DeFi: Custo-DeFi is a new concept created by our Centralex team. The name says it already, Custodial DeFi. How does this work? You have Centralized exchanges who are a custodial service where you store all your assets and private keys. If you want to stake, governance or join any other DeFi solution you need to transfer your funds to a DeFi (Web3) wallet. When we talk about a DEX we know that you are 100% in control over your own wallets and funds and are able to do P2P transactions. We are Centralex put both CEX and DEX into one platform called Custo-DeFi. This allows you as a user to use the full custodial safety from a CEX but have the freedom of a DEX. This allows you to stake, governance, and participate in any other DeFi soliution on the market including trading on UniSwap or any other decentralized exchange. This all thanks to our partner Fireblocks.com who is providing us Centralex the best wallet technology in the industry with their Multi sig MPC wallet technology. Centralex will NEVER store your private keys on any of our servers. The CenX token is a deflationary token, and much like the staking rewards will follow a yearly â€œhalving burn rate. Every transaction where CenX is used on the Centralex exchange for transactional fees will result in a specific percentage of the token supply being burned. The burn will start at 5% and will halve each year thereafter. This decreases the total supply of CenX, thus increasing the scarcity of each token and our burn schedule looks as followed. First-year 5%, second year 2.5% and every year after this will be halved.","links":"https://centralex.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/centralex/logo.png"}
