{"name":"Deliq","id":"deliq","symbol":"dlq","description":"Deliq is a protocol that enables protocol-owned liquidity on Avalanche by using a capital efficient and decentralized Liquidity-by-Staking model. Liquidity Providers (LPs) can provide single-sided liquidity to Deliq liquidity pools (DLPs) and earn yields for doing so. Liquidity in the pools is aggregated before deploying on exchanges. A unique three-layered impermanent loss (IL) mitigation mechanism ensures that LPs get 100% protection from IL for providing liquidity. Liquidity Directors (LDs) can stake $DLQ to direct liquidity from DLPs to various exchanges on Avalanche and own their liquidity while diversifying their treasury and generating a new revenue source for the protocol.","links":"https://deliqfinance.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/deliq/logo.png"}
