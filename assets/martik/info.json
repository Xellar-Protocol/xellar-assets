{"name":"Martik","id":"martik","symbol":"mtk","description":"Martik is the governance token of the Martik ecosystem. a DEX/CEX, launch platform, private sales, liquidity lock, staking service platform and creation of NFTs, which provides services to other tokens. On this platform, already in operation, other tokens can create a liquidity pool by providing stake for their users and generating fees for Martik. They can also use the platform to create their smart NFTs according to the needs of their projects. The Martik ecosystem allows those interested in launching a token to create a private sale directly on the BEP-20 network on the Martik platform, through direct integration with Thrust Wallet and metamask; likewise, the Martik platform also provides pre-sales and fairlaunch hosting, just like pinksale does. The ecosystem also offers liquidity locking for other tokens in an easy way. Hiring these services generate revenues that sustainably feed the growth of the Martik project. In the project's tokenomics, we have: fees of 10% on purchases and 10% on sales, with 5% being used to automatically burn the supply, making the token hyperdeflationary, and the other 5% feeding the Martik stake pool for its own holders. Martik's DEX/CEX is under development, and currently it already has the p2p limit order system operating on its platform via the BEP20 network. The project is currently in transition between stages 3 and 4 of its roadmap. In the last stage of the roadmap, a multichain bridge for your token across all major blockchains will be implemented.","links":"https://martik.site","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/martik/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x116526135380e28836c6080f1997645d5a807fae"}}}
