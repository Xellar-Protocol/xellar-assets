{"name":"JustCarbon Governance","id":"justcarbon-governance","symbol":"jcg","description":"JustCarbon is revolutionising the way in which carbon offsetting projects are funded. We are achieving this by developing a blockchain-backed platform for friction-free trading of JCRs (our carbon backed token) without the middlemen. JustCarbon Governance Tokens (JCGs) are the native governance tokens of the JustCarbon system. They exist as utility tokens to facilitate the Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) that operates the JustCarbon platform. The system: • Manages the JCR via a DAO. • Ensures no single body/country owns or controls the JCR. • Allows voting for supporters/users of the platform. • Is used to reward supporters/users of the platform. • Provides a trading discount for supporters/users of the platform. • Manages the gifting of JCGs to initial participants. The total amount of JCG tokens issued will be limited to 1 billion, with only 10% liquid at launch and the remainder being allocated and vested over a 10 year period.","links":"https://www.justcarbon.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/justcarbon-governance/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xbe601dd49da9ee1d2f64d422c4aecf8eb83c119f"}}}
