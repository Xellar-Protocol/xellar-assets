{"name":"JUDAS","id":"judas","symbol":"$judas","description":"The start of Meme Fi Judas is founded on the belief that meme coins can generate yield. The token is a nod to Judas Iscariot, the gentleman best known for betraying Jesus, but the only thing $Judas is about to betray, is the norm. The first game: A fair coin flip game, where users can bet THE CHOSEN meme coins for a chance to flip for more. Bets get taxed 3.5%. These fees are split equally among stakers of that meme coin and Judas stakers. The coinflip is just the first game and there are other games lined up that are skilled based, PvP and risk-to-earn. Letâ€™s bring value to memes.","links":"https://www.judascoin.xyz/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/judas/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa5e0b9118ce23dd1eec52cd93cf59e8ea3b3ff56"}}}
