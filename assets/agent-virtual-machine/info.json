{"name":"Agent Virtual Machine","id":"agent-virtual-machine","symbol":"avm","description":"VM (Agent Virtual Machine) is the runtime layer for the agent economy: a secure, scalable compute protocol that turns agent outputs into real-world execution. It bridges large language models (LLMs) and code execution, allowing agents to autonomously run scripts, process data, and interact with systems without infrastructure overhead. Powered by MCP, it enables trustless, high-throughput code execution with zero DevOps.","links":"https://www.avm.codes/","market_cap":10697088,"market_cap_rank":1739,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/agent-virtual-machine/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf5f52266a57e6d7312da39bd7ab9527b9e975c40","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xf5f52266a57e6d7312da39bd7ab9527b9e975c40"}}}
