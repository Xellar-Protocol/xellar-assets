{"name":"Salary Mining","id":"salary-mining","symbol":"slrm","description":"The Salary Mining Token is the first Mining Token with its OWN PHYSICAL Mining-Farm. Unlike other \"\"Farming\"\" projects that stake liquidity, $SLRM participates in high yielding Proof of Work mining - and will utilize equipment that is versatile so as to not be limited to select chains. Profits from mining will be sold and used to purchase $SLR. The purchased SLR will be distributed to existing holders, regularly. THE MINE WITHOUT…THE MINE Owning your own crypto mining equipment can sound tempting – but there are so many variables to consider. Which equipment should you buy? How much does your electricity cost? Which token should you mine? $SLRM takes the guesswork out of the equation. Hold SLRM and earn. So simple \"\" NOT OUR FIRST RODEO \"\" $SLRM is the second token to be released by Salary Eco Finance. We have an established (and amazing!) community, a working proof-of-concept ($SLR), and rock-solid experience growing a successful crypto project. \"\" IF IT AIN’T BROKE… \"\" DeFi has already proven that Reflections can deliver incredible value. Crypto mining has also proven to be a viable source of passive income generation. $SLRM leverages the best of both of these worlds and into a single, tradable token. A DIGITAL TOKEN – WITH PHYSICAL PROPERTIE At Salary Eco Finance – we have a strong desire to bridge the crypto and traditional worlds. Many investors are tempted to invest in digital currencies but favor physical assets over digital ones. $SLRM appeals to people with this mindset – as proceeds from taxes are utilized to purchase mining equipment in the “real world”. Over time, $SLRM will develop a robust network of mining rigs, globally!","links":"https://salaryeco.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/salary-mining/logo.png"}
