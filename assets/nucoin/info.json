{"name":"NuCoin","id":"nucoin","symbol":"nuc","description":"NuCoin is a fully completed native blockchain originally built by NuGenesis for Government and transnational corporate applications. In the context of building a blockchain for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC’s), and an exchange clearing house for settlement, limitations to scaling and speed, latency and reliance on human miners and validators had to be eliminated. Security had to be enhanced, its integrity underscored by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and carbon neutral in its efficiency. NuCoin is a service coin that is burned. Most Layer 1’s rely on layer 2 projects to buy and stake their native token to remove it from circulation and therefore increase the price. NuGenesis instead requires projects to pay for services with NuCoin, but this NuCoin is burned and does not exist.All services on the NuGenesis system rely on NuCoin. For example, the Layer 1 interactive NFT platform, which is gas less will be charging for NFT creation and exchange. The NuCoin used for the transaction will beburned. NuGenesis has a smart contract DNC (Digital Notarised Contracts) Platform. This is the next Generation of smart contracts. Unlike existing smart contracts, they overcome the limitations of linear time ordering by allowing for parallel and concurrent processing to allow for more complex variables in contracts. The DNC platform provides an increasing suite of standardised commercial transaction scenarios with counterparty protections such as multi-sig wallets and treasuries and AI notary supervision.","links":"https://nucoin.com.au/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nucoin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
