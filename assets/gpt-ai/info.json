{"name":"GPT AI","id":"gpt-ai","symbol":"ai","description":"GPT AI is a ZK Layer-2 blockchain that powers the AI revolution and provides intelligent, decentralized AI services by creating new opportunities for growth and innovation. GPT AI is an AI-based technology that uses deep learning algorithms to simulate the human thought process. This technology can be used for various applications such as speech recognition, natural language processing, machine translation, and more. By training neural networks to learn large amounts of data, GPT AI can achieve natural understanding of human language, enabling it to generate coherent language output. The development of an L2 network by GPT AI will provide a more scalable and cost- effective solution for the provision of AI services. By utilizing intelligent decentralization principles, the network will be more secure, transparent, and resilient, ensuring that the AI services provided are of the highest quality. This approach will also allow for greater accessibility and inclusivity in the AI space, as the network will be open to all users and not just those with high levels of technical expertise. Overall, the development of this L2 network represents an important step towards the democratization of AI services, making them more widely available and accessible to people from","links":"https://aitoken.link/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gpt-ai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x3548e7c2af658957692ec0397eed431e85bf952b"}}}
