{"name":"Attention Token","id":"attention-token_base","symbol":"attn","description":"Collective Memory is a new kind of social network - a living map of reality, built from unfiltered moments people share in real time. It’s a space where attention and trust become the foundation of how we connect and create value together. Powered by the ATTN token, Collective Memory transforms attention into a real, tradable asset. Users capture and share authentic “Memories” - short, unfiltered moments from real life - and others can invest ATTN to support what resonates with them. Each investment amplifies visibility for that Memory and rewards both the creator and early supporters. This creates a transparent attention economy, where value flows directly between people - not through algorithms. All activity is recorded on-chain, forming a verified, decentralized record of human experience: a collective awareness of reality. By turning genuine attention into a measurable signal of truth, Collective Memory bridges social media, crypto, and AI - building a new kind of trust layer for the real world.","links":"https://www.collectivememory.ai","market_cap":2617907,"market_cap_rank":2686,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/attention-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0x032a7252b4932c44bde89aee6275744376a96bff","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x032a7252b4932c44bde89aee6275744376a96bff"}},"is_native":false}
