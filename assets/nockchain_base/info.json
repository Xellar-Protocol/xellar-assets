{"name":"Nockchain","id":"nockchain_base","symbol":"nock","description":"Nockchain is the first L1 blockchain powered by Zero-Knowledge Proof of Work (ZKPoW). Nodes secure the chain and produce blocks by mining zero-knowledge proofs in a PoW competition. Transactions scale as the network difficulty grows to maintain a high velocity of money without bottlenecking. $NOCK is the digital asset for the Nock ecosystem. It's scarce hard money secured by zero-knowledge proofs on Nockchain. $NOCK was fair-launched with no pre-mine in May 2025.","links":"https://www.nockchain.org/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nockchain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":16,"contract_address":"0x9b5e262cf9bb04869ab40b19af91d2dc85761722","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x9b5e262cf9bb04869ab40b19af91d2dc85761722"}},"is_native":false}
