{"name":"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena","id":"unidentified-anomalous-phenomena","symbol":"uap","description":"UAP (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena) includes anything unusual seen in the sky, space, or even underwater that can’t easily be explained. It goes beyond “UFO” (Unidentified Flying Object), which only refers to things flying and often makes people think of alien spaceships. UAP covers a wider range of strange events and objects, not just flying ones, to better understand what might be happening. The project's vision is to help the decades old long movement of truth-seekers. Its mission is expediting the progress of the UAP/UFO community, to finally find the answers for the thousands of questions humanity has been asking for centuries. Sadly, the tightly kept secrets regarding the unknown such as flying objects, aliens, the unknown and everything in-between are protected by relentless forces, therefor we must unite and use the power of crypto to break open Pandora's box that is kept away from the public.","links":"https://uaponsol.com","market_cap":46337,"market_cap_rank":8620,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/unidentified-anomalous-phenomena/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"5JDtsBBzPdpYzTBXw7GPJ6KQvy95e6D89dWPKeWWpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/5JDtsBBzPdpYzTBXw7GPJ6KQvy95e6D89dWPKeWWpump"}}}
