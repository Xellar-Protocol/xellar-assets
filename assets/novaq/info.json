{"name":"NovaQ","id":"novaq","symbol":"novaq","description":"NovaQ emerges precisely at this tectonic intersection. It is not merely another AI toolkit; it is a post‑quantum integrity protocol disguised in the friendly form of a Telegram‑native suite. NovaQ weaves together three high‑impact capabilities—model attestation, prompt optimization, and adversarial stress‑testing—into a single, click‑away experience. Behind the conversational façade lies a layered security architecture that borrows ideas from trusted‑execution enclaves, Merkle‑tree audit logs, lattice‑inspired linguistic filters, and WebAssembly‑style sandboxing. The result is a portable “trust engine” that any AI team can invoke to prove their models are authentic, refine their language prompts for clarity and safety, and demonstrate their API’s resilience under quantum‑era threat models.","links":"https://novaq.network/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/novaq/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xf2b733bdddb8e12f0b3e15781b319389d499dad6","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xf2b733bdddb8e12f0b3e15781b319389d499dad6"}}}
