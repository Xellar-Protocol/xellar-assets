{"name":"Staked INV","id":"staked-inv","symbol":"sinv","description":"Yield-bearing staked INV sINV, or staked INV, brings the INV governance token to users who do not trade on Ethereum mainnet or who do not use FiRM. sINV also gives users a way to hold INV without the need to manually claim rewards, while creating opportunities to make sINV available in liquidity pools or as loan collateral on third party lending markets. sINV is a yield-bearing, synthetic token that derives its yield by autocompounding rewards sent to INV stakers on Inverse Finance’s FiRM lending market. Users who stake INV as sINV receive a constant stream of DBR’s, in addition to INV staking rewards, which are continually swapped into more INV, resulting in yield-bearing sINV. Depositing INV for sINV further incentivizes the long-term holding of INV, creates continuous market buy pressure on INV, and resulting in reduced liquidity costs per circulating INV and improved overall unit economics of the protocol.","links":"https://www.inverse.finance/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/staked-inv/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x08d23468a467d2bb86fae0e32f247a26c7e2e994","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x08d23468a467d2bb86fae0e32f247a26c7e2e994"}}}
