{"name":"semicon1","id":"semicon1","symbol":"smc1","description":"SEMICON1 aims to increase its market share in the semiconductor fabless field as quickly as possible. In the field of fabless (semiconductor R&D method), the superiority of materials engineering along with differentiated production technology determines the success or failure of market share and business operation. In recent years, this trend is accelerating in the semiconductor industry, where nanotechnology has been introduced to enable faster integration and nanotechnology.","links":"http://semicon1.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/semicon1/logo.png"}
