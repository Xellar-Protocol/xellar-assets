{"name":"degen the otter","id":"degen-the-otter","symbol":"degen","description":"Hai! My name is Degen, I'm an Otter! I live in Indonesia, and I have more than a billion views across all platforms. Come swim with me ðŸ™‚ The degen life isnâ€™t for everyone, People believe itâ€™s something you become, truth is youâ€™re a degen or youâ€™re not, Itâ€™s something youâ€™re born as. People assume we post every project we buy, Well thatâ€™s not true, Weâ€™re out here 20+ hours a day grinding and quite often neglecting the ones we love in the process in a bid to make life changing gains to better their lives. Our sole aim is to print, but not alone. We want everyone that believes in us to print too. We get rugged daily, sometimes multiple times by dodgy devs, We get JEETED hard by 2x dumpers and when a dev goes rogue investors point straight at us because we backed it whilst the devs step away. Iâ€™m not complaining even slightly, I love being a degen, I love this space, this moment of time is a gift and I intend to cherish every second of it, The good, the bad and the indifferent. I love the degen way of life, I love my community and I promise with every ounce of my being Iâ€™ll give everything possible to help everyone that believes in me print over the next 18/24 months. Donâ€™t get me wrong, Itâ€™s a long journey and will be turbulent at times but weâ€™ll get there. -ctm","links":"https://degentheotter.xyz/","market_cap":58004,"market_cap_rank":5184,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/degen-the-otter/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"8AGrudQDbjNjnHzBsrndfVDBHgg6KBJ7RN6j3hbfq3Qh"}}}
