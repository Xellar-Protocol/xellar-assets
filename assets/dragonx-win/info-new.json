{"name":"DragonX.win","id":"dragonx-win","symbol":"dragonx","description":"During the DragonX launch phase, users submit TitanX to the DragonX contracts. The contract mints DragonX in return. Through publicly callable functions, maximum length TitanX stakes are created by the contract. The Ethereum rewards from these stakes are used to buy TitanX off the market and stake it. DragonX is bought and burned off the market with a portion of the Ethereum rewards earned through TitanX stakes.","links":"https://dragonx.win/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dragonx-win/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x96a5399d07896f757bd4c6ef56461f58db951862"}}}
