{"name":"ICTech","id":"ictech","symbol":"ict","description":"What is the project about? ICTECH is building the infrastructure that will redefine what Web3 is capable of. Our mission is to provide the resources that complex applications such as metaverses and games need to stand head-to-head with their Web2 counterparts and place them in a rich and ever-expanding ecosystem. What makes your project unique? The world's first Layer-1 dedicated to high-end applications, providing a detailed SDK interface that will allow any developer to quickly build applications on the ICTECH network. Additionally, ICTECH offers a wider range of protocols for NFTs that include minting, trading, burning, lending, borrowing, auctioning, combining, time-based synthesis, and more. This is, arguably, the most in-depth public blockchain network for its field. ICTECH utilizes BFT for its PoS consensus mechanism, allowing it to achieve very high TPS with a 6s finality. Atomic Broadcasts: This allows for multiple types of transactions and commands to be included in the same block, providing real-time consensus. Stay tuned for further developments and details!
