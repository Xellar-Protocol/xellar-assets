{"name":"Pumptopia","id":"pumptopia","symbol":"ptpa","description":"We develop robust real-time utilities, the first example of our real-time utility is \"\"Topia-gram\"\" which is the first Crypto Messenger.\"\" This messenger is like the traditional messengers we already have, where you can chat, create groups, send files, etc. But the exciting part is what makes this messenger so special is you only need a Metamask wallet to connect. Our first state-of-the-art feature is the automatic recognition of contract addresses in the chat. When the bot detects a contract address, a buy button appears under it. If you click on it, your metamask confirmation will open and you can confirm the purchase. Furthermore, we have planned many more features for our messenger, you will be able to create groups in which tweets from selected influencers will be posted automatically. This saves you the confusion of scrolling on Twitter and you have all the tweets that interest you in one place.","links":"https://pumptopia.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pumptopia/logo.png"}
