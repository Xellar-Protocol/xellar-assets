{"name":"Poseidon","id":"poseidon-4_solana","symbol":"pos","description":"Poseidon is a zero-knowledge shielded transaction system built on Solana. It uses Groth16 zkSNARKs and a Merkle tree of note commitments to provide private deposits, transfers, and withdrawals. Unlike centralized privacy solutions that rely on API-based services, Poseidon is a fully decentralized on-chain program that operates trustlessly on Solana's blockchain. On-chain observers see funds entering and leaving the pool but cannot reliably link specific deposits to withdrawals.","links":"https://poseidon.cash","market_cap":200037,"market_cap_rank":5918,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/poseidon-4_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"EMKP9FV5wakvyodPh8edQW4RTSbHPrhYRDEiCiz1pump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/EMKP9FV5wakvyodPh8edQW4RTSbHPrhYRDEiCiz1pump"}},"is_native":false}
