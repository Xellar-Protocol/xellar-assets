{"name":"Jungle DeFi","id":"jungle-defi","symbol":"jfi","description":"\"Jungle Finance aims to provide a platform to allow users to tokenize and sell the rights to their future yield (such as staking, farm rewards, etc) independently of the collateral asset. Our focus is on providing liquid markets for both the base asset and the yield asset, in order to provide maximum value to users choosing to utilize the protocol. With an initial focus on the Solana ecosystem, we intend to expand into the ETH and LUNA ecosystems as well. JFI is the governance token for the Jungle Finance protocol, granting users the right to vote on supported assets, JFI farm reward allocation and treasury spend. \"","links":"https://jungledefi.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/jungle-defi/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"GePFQaZKHcWE5vpxHfviQtH5jgxokSs51Y5Q4zgBiMDs"}}}
