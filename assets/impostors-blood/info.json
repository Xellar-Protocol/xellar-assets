{"name":"Impostors Blood","id":"impostors-blood","symbol":"blood","description":"$BLOOD is an ERC-20 utility token at the center of the Impostors economy. Players accumulate $BLOOD and can redeem it for a variety of perks and in-game items. Metaverses are boring without games, and competitive games lack social connection. There needs to be a middle ground. Social gaming bridges the gap between today’s Twitch culture and the future of immersive metaverses. Impostors is a AAA social gaming metaverse that is truly player-owned and powered. Impostors’ first game mode will be a social deduction game. The Impostors Genesis drop will give holders access to all Genesis Season events. Each event provides access to a different part of the Impostorverse.","links":"https://impostors.gg/blood","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/impostors-blood/logo.png"}
