{"name":"Ordinals Deflation","id":"ordinals-deflation","symbol":"odef","description":"Introduction Earn passive rewards with oDEF! Watch your balance grow endlessly through static reflection. Goals Our ultimate objective is to increase the holdings of the burn wallet through a higher number of transactions. This will result in a greater amount of token deflation. The Advantages of Deflationary Tokens for Ordinals Deflation tokens like oDEF bring benefits to holders! Unlike traditional methods that require staking or contract involvement, oDEF offers automatic reflection fees. Holders earn passive income effortlessly, without the need for any additional transactions. How does it work? Each transfer, buy, or sale within the system incurs a 3% transaction fee that is distributed among all holders. Furthermore, 1% of the fee is allocated to the development team, while another 1% is directed toward the burn wallet. It's worth noting that the burn address itself is considered a holder, resulting in each transaction contributing to supply deflation. No team token. 100% token to the community To ensure accurate balance calculations for all holders, we will develop an indexer capable of querying and computing reflection tokens. In the event of widespread adoption, we can collaborate with major marketplaces to integrate our indexer for $oDEF.","links":"https://docs.odef.xyz/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ordinals-deflation/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ordinals":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":"7f9f960a511918784b86110607672b5fec09b75b8f36f1f2191d264fcacbd1b3i0"}}}
