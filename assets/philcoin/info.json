{"name":"Philcoin","id":"philcoin","symbol":"phl","description":"Philcoin is a philanthropic movement in the blockchain whose purpose is to establish a global Interactive Ecosystem where the daily use of IOT “Internet Of Things”, Social Media, educational, means of communication, become a rail where people can earn while they use the products and services. Given our history of humanitarian support and endeavours, Philcoin’s purpose is to give back while people transact on blockchain. Philcoin’s vision is to create the largest community of philanthropists around the world in a time and age where over 1.7B people are unbanked, over 55% of people in the USA alone cannot read a book on an 8th grade level, and where giving back has not been a global initiative in the blockchain space where billions of dollars have been directed to projects without a purpose. Philcoin’s mission is to help build a digital economy while chatting, participating in educational programs, accessing entertainment, playing video games and shopping. Our educational system and philanthropic partnerships allow everyone an equal opportunity in generating digital wealth through an BEP20 Token marked “PHL”, using Smart contracts which demonstrate a high level of a transparency and user-friendly environment. This will all be achieved while fulfilling the purpose of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations and every humanitarian support garnered within our ecosystem.","links":"https://philcoin.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/philcoin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x68dd887d012abdf99d3492621e4d576a3f75019d"},"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x723bd1f87a327e94ceabf68d8f022e0f54b9cc1a"}}}
