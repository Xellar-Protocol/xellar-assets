{"name":"Elixir deUSD","id":"elixir-deusd","symbol":"deusd","description":"Elixir deUSD is a synthetic asset collateralized by Ethereum – powered by the Elixir Network. Elixir’s 14,000+ global validators act as the computation and execution layer for deUSD. Elixir uses underlying ETH collateral for perpetual shorts on ETH, with an aim of net-zero delta for the asset across decentralized and centralized exchange venues. Long term, deUSD can be minted and burned by anyone, and will be the default collateral within the Elixir ecosystem. During periods of positive funding rates, this trade collects yield that gets passed onto deUSD stakers. When funding is negative, the Elixir network can collect reverse basis, enabling a more resilient system in all market conditions.","links":"https://elixir.xyz","market_cap":116736082,"market_cap_rank":328,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/elixir-deusd/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x15700b564ca08d9439c58ca5053166e8317aa138"}}}
