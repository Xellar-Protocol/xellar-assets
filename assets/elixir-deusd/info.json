Used exclusively by Securitize, deUSD is the default currency bringing on-chain composability for BlackRock, Hamilton Lane, and other institutions. deUSD is natively yield bearing, earning from a mixture of treasuries and funding yield. This yield flows directly to the staked version of the asset (sdeUSD). deUSD is a key component of the Elixir ecosystem and will serve as preferred collateral for orderbook exchanges.","links":"https://elixir.xyz","market_cap":235202785,"market_cap_rank":345,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/elixir-deusd/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x15700b564ca08d9439c58ca5053166e8317aa138"}}}
