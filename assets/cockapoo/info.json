{"name":"Cockapoo","id":"cockapoo","symbol":"cpoo","description":"Cockapoo is a new type of crypto coin. Born from the mix of a cocker-spaniel and poodle, Cockapoo is here to prove that we are the best dog token in the crypto-verse. We are launching our mobile app Cpoo where users can request pooper scoopers to clean up dog poop. The Cpoo app will be powered solely by our crypto token $CPOO. Cockapoo is a deflationary token with static reflection that rewards holders so, the more poop that is scooped on the app, the more Cockapoo coins added to your wallet. Simply hold Cockapoo and 2% from each transaction is automatically redistributed to the Cockapoo holders.","links":"https://cockapoo.org/","market_cap":1501.66,"market_cap_rank":4775,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cockapoo/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x71809c4ff017ceade03038a8b597ecabb6519918"}}}
