{"name":"Frogs","id":"frogs","symbol":"$frogs","description":"On October 18, 2024, Frogs organized a fair mint event involving 42,069 addresses, consuming approximately 122.3 ETH in gas fees which was burned automatically. With no venture capital, no pre-reserves, and no insider trading, this approach sets a new standard for meme token issuance. Frogs’ rise demonstrates that fairness and decentralization remain the core demands of traders. More than just a meme token, Frogs is what we call a cult. Looking forward, Frogs is poised to inspire more projects to adopt similar fair issuance models, driving positive change in the Ethereum ecosystem and the broader crypto market.","links":"https://www.frogseth.cc/","market_cap":17040.46,"market_cap_rank":10191,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/frogs/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x3e9c3dc19efe4271d1a65facfca55906045f7b08","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x3e9c3dc19efe4271d1a65facfca55906045f7b08"}}}
