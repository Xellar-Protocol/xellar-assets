{"name":"Built on Nothing","id":"built-on-nothing_solana","symbol":"bon","description":"\"Built on Nothing\" is a humorous and cleverly crafted memecoin project that was developed on the fast, low-cost, and highly scalable Solana blockchain. It was originally launched as a playful satire, designed to poke fun at and highlight the widespread belief that many memecoins lack any real-world value, clear purpose, or functional utility—ultimately suggesting that they are, quite literally, built on nothing, yet still manage to build something meaningful.","links":"https://builtonnothing.com","market_cap":41384,"market_cap_rank":8501,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/built-on-nothing_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"2g1Dh2j9AsdpnR5Js24cdtuUEE3KQD1YpHG8NgQ2pump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/2g1Dh2j9AsdpnR5Js24cdtuUEE3KQD1YpHG8NgQ2pump"}},"is_native":false}
