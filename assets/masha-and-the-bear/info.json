{"name":"Masha and the Bear","id":"masha-and-the-bear","symbol":"masha","description":"MASHA is a Solana-based memecoin project that explores crypto culture through humor, storytelling, and community participation. It centers around two symbolic characters—Masha, a curious girl, and Bear, her skeptical companion—who reflect the contrasting personalities in crypto: the dreamers and the realists. The project was launched without a presale, VC investment, or team allocation, emphasizing fair distribution and decentralized ownership. Rather than offering traditional utility, MASHA embraces memes and cultural expression as its core value. The project invites users to co-create content, participate in social experiments, and shape a narrative that satirizes and celebrates the chaos of Web3.","links":"https://mashatoken.com/","market_cap":2272242,"market_cap_rank":3189,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/masha-and-the-bear/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"mae8vJGf8Wju8Ron1oDTQVaTGGBpcpWDwoRQJALMMf2","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/mae8vJGf8Wju8Ron1oDTQVaTGGBpcpWDwoRQJALMMf2"}}}
