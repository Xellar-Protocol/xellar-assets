{"name":"Term Structure","id":"term-structure","symbol":"term","description":"Term Structure is a non-custodial fixed-income protocol that enables fixed-rate, fixed-term, and peer-to-peer borrowing and lending. This includes the development of Primary Markets with auctions and Secondary and Repurchase Markets with real-time order books. The protocol achieves scalability by using zkTrue-up, a customized Zk Rollup that maintains data availability, increases transaction speed, and allows users to place and cancel orders without gas fees.
