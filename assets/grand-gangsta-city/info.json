{"name":"Grand Gangsta City","id":"grand-gangsta-city","symbol":"$ggc","description":"The GGC Ecosystem is a multi-platform gaming universe powered by the GGC Token, designed to unify diverse gameplay experiences through a shared economy, player ownership, and blockchain-backed progression. Spanning PC and mobile platforms, it connects players across narrative-rich worlds, strategic multiplayer battles, and raw survival shooters, offering optional NFT utility and a player-driven token economy. The ecosystem is anchored by three core titles: Grand Gangsta City (PC, Narrative RPG), West Land Arena (Mobile, Base-Building Strategy), and Deathmatch (PC, FPS Survival Arena). The GGC Token serves as the backbone, functioning as an in-game currency for upgrades, exclusive content, and unlockables, while enabling NFT transactions for buying, selling, or trading in-game assets like characters, gear, or land. Players can earn cross-game rewards, unlocking bonuses in one title through performance in another. Planned governance features will allow token holders to vote on ecosystem proposals, content updates, and NFT drops, while staking offers passive earnings, loot drops, or leaderboard boosts. More than just a gaming platform, the GGC Ecosystem delivers a cross-genre entertainment experience, blending immersive storytelling, player ownership, and strategic scalability through Web3, empowering players’ journeys whether they’re building strongholds, battling the undead, or rising through the underworld.","links":"https://grandgangstacity.com","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/grand-gangsta-city/logo.png","detail_platform":{"sei-v2":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x58e11d8ed38a2061361e90916540c5c32281a380","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/sei-evm/tokens/0x58e11d8ed38a2061361e90916540c5c32281a380"}}}
