{"name":"Welltrado","id":"welltrado","symbol":"wtl","description":"Crypto is extremely volatile. Investors are often victims of currency manipulation, with few options to spread their portfolio into more stable assets. Welltrado tackles the problem by connecting 4500+ p2p investment platforms into a single network, making over 1 million existing investments available to the Crypto Community. P2P investment market is currently experiencing explosive growth. The global market volume reached $114 billion in 2017, with no sign of slowing down. However, this expansive growth has presented three major problems: 1. Difficulties in diversifying and managing investments. 2. Issues with transparency and reputation. 3.Problems with the mobility of cryptocurrency and assets across borders. We propose three solutions to them: 1. Cross platform loan aggregator with ratings and blockchain. 2. Crypto P2P fund for global and cross-border participants. 3. Portfolio management of loans across platforms in a single dashboard. We believe that this toolbox of solutions is a win for all. The Crypto Community will gain unprecedented access to a decentralized and stable asset class. The large risk-averse institutional investors will get a method to trade the high volumes they seek. The retail investors will benefit of a large amount of assets formerly inaccessible to them.","links":"https://welltrado.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/welltrado/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x9a0587eae7ef64b2b38a10442a44cfa43edd7d2a"}}}
