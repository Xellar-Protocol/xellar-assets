{"name":"TORA","id":"tora","symbol":"tora","description":"The TORA project is a collection of high-quality projects operating on the Polygon/Matic chain. Our goal is to raise awareness and promote these projects by aggregating them in a single place, to benefit from increased visibility and access to a larger customer base. Through a intuitive, attractive and interactive user experience, we aim to innovate, educate and facilitate the widespread adoption of the Polygon network. By aggregating these projects into a single place, we believe that they will benefit from increased visibility and access to a larger customer base. Despite the presence of several promising projects on the Polygon / Matic chain, many of them are currently unknown to the broader public. Our goal is to change that by raising awareness and promoting these projects through our marketing efforts. Additionally, the TORA project is driven by the principle of decentralization, which is at the core of the blockchain and cryptocurrency movement. By decentralizing the power and revenue generated by these projects, we aim to empower the “average Joe” in the street and share the benefits with our partners on the Polygon network. Through our best efforts, we hope to demonstrate the true potential of decentralized marketplace and its ability to create a more equitable and inclusive digital economy.","links":"https://www.toramatic.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/tora/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd0b3a0e0ea080a0882d6e048cae8558f010ce81f"}}}
