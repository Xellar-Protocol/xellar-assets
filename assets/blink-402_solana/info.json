{"name":"Blink-402","id":"blink-402_solana","symbol":"b402","description":"Blink402 is a Solana-based payment protocol that implements the HTTP-402 / x402 standard, enabling developers and creators to charge or reward users directly through Blinks. It allows pay-per-API calls, automated on-chain actions, and “reverse Blinks” that pay users for completing tasks. The project’s goal is to make real-time micro-transactions simple, transparent, and usable across tools, bots, and trading platforms.","links":"https://blink402.dev/","market_cap":17228.51,"market_cap_rank":10056,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/blink-402/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"2mESiwuVdfft9PxG7x36rvDvex6ccyY8m8BKCWJqpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/2mESiwuVdfft9PxG7x36rvDvex6ccyY8m8BKCWJqpump"}},"is_native":false}
