Cheyenne was the first animal to be rescued and rehabilitated by the beloved P'Nuts the Squirrels Freedom Farm. P’Nuts Freedom Farm is a nonprofit sanctuary for saving animals in need of a forever home. Cheyenne played a big part in both the sanctuary and the hearts of all those around him, so much so he was drawn into the logo and made an icon forever alongside his brothers Fred and PNUT himself.
