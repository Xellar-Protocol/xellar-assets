{"name":"KOHAKU","id":"kohaku_ethereum","symbol":"kohaku","description":"Kohaku was born straight out of Vitalik’s vision — the idea that Ethereum needs a cloak, not just armor. It’s not another tool. It’s a guardian fox: the meme that reminds us security isn’t a feature, it’s the foundation. Kohaku stands for: Privacy as default. Safety as culture. Community as power. Think of it as Ethereum’s shadow — watching, protecting, and making sure the future of finance can move without fear. KOHAKU isn’t just a wallet. It’s the meme-driven reminder that in Ethereum, privacy = freedom.","links":"https://kohakueth.live/","market_cap":64183,"market_cap_rank":7785,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kohaku/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xbd821d84770b65f679a47452367258cf86579d02","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xbd821d84770b65f679a47452367258cf86579d02"}},"is_native":false}
