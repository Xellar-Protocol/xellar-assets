{"name":"Picasso","id":"picasso_solana","symbol":"pica","description":"Picasso is a DeFi infrastructure-focused Layer 1 protocol designed to address the challenges of cross-chain interoperability and security. It achieves this by extending the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol to connect multiple ecosystems, including Solana, Ethereum, Cosmos, and Polkadot. Picasso functions as a cross-ecosystem IBC hub, enabling secure asset transfers and facilitating the cross-pollination of assets, builders, and communities between these networks. The project also introduces a Generalized Restaking Layer, allowing users to enhance the security of various blockchain networks by restaking assets across multiple Proof-of-Stake (PoS) systems.","links":"https://www.picasso.network/","market_cap":26637,"market_cap_rank":9224,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/picasso/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"966vsqwoS3ZBrHesTyAvE7esFV2kaHaDFLLXs4asPdLJ","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/966vsqwoS3ZBrHesTyAvE7esFV2kaHaDFLLXs4asPdLJ"}},"is_native":false}
