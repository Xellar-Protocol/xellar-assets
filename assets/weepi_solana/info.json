{"name":"Weepi","id":"weepi_solana","symbol":"weepi","description":"Weepi (ticker: WEEPI) is a memecoin launched on 9 September 2025 on the Solana blockchain. The project was created as a cultural and creative experiment rather than a utility-driven cryptocurrency. At its core is a hand-drawn character known as “The Eternal Observer,” symbolizing the token and its community. Weepi represents the act of observing the volatile and unpredictable nature of crypto markets, positioning itself as a cultural artifact that connects with traders, collectors, and online communities. The project’s purpose is to address boredom and foster engagement through digital culture, storytelling, and creativity rather than financial utility.","links":"https://weepi.art/","market_cap":5108.65,"market_cap_rank":12335,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/weepi_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"vyygC9ojzrPKWbHZMCVg6xNiNTHAnXGmAgARfeopump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/vyygC9ojzrPKWbHZMCVg6xNiNTHAnXGmAgARfeopump"}},"is_native":false}
