AuctionShack enables anyone to list and sell secondhand goods in under 10 seconds using AI-generated titles, descriptions, and tags, with a map-based discovery experience. Shack extends this mission into Web3 by rewarding community engagement, incentivizing decentralized recommerce, and connecting crypto culture with a real, growing product. It blends the meme energy of the Solana ecosystem with real-world commerce utility, creating a bridge between on-chain participation and off-chain marketplace growth.","links":"https://www.auctionshack.com/","market_cap":5261798,"market_cap_rank":2030,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/shack-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"BHvPQ9dFAiZJUSYJFpEmdfMmgz48iLohyxyixBfZjups","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/BHvPQ9dFAiZJUSYJFpEmdfMmgz48iLohyxyixBfZjups"}},"is_native":false}
