{"name":"KITTEE","id":"kittee-2_solana","symbol":"kte","description":"Overview of KITTEE (KTE) KITTEE (ticker: KTE) is a community-driven meme coin built on the Solana blockchain, launched through the pump.fun platform—a popular decentralized exchange for creating and trading meme tokens. As a Solana-based project, it leverages the network's high-speed, low-cost transactions to facilitate quick and accessible trading. The token embodies the playful spirit of internet culture, centering around a cat-themed mascot. KITTEE positions itself purely as a meme, emphasizing fun, community engagement, and cultural expression rather than any form of financial investment or security. The project explicitly disclaims any intent to function as an investment contract, highlighting its roots in decentralized, peer-to-peer digital creativity. Origins and Background KITTEE originated as an online meme, evolving into a tokenized asset on Solana. Its creation draws from the broader meme coin ecosystem, where humorous, viral concepts are transformed into blockchain-based tokens to foster community interaction. The project's logo and artwork were custom-designed to represent KITTEE as a fun, approachable character—a stylized cat that has become synonymous with the token. This mascot draws from popular internet cat memes, tapping into the cultural phenomenon of feline-themed content that has dominated social media for years. Unlike utility-focused cryptocurrencies, KITTEE's foundation is in entertainment and shared enthusiasm, popularized through online communities and social platforms like X (formerly Twitter). The token was launched on pump.fun, a platform known for enabling anyone to create meme coins with a bonding curve mechanism. This setup allows the token's price to increase as more people buy in, creating a gamified launch experience. As of recent activity the project has seen moments of hype, including announcements of all-time highs and calls to action for community members to join before potential further growth. Themes and Cultural References At its core, KITTEE revolves around themes of fun, friendliness, and lighthearted internet culture. The cat mascot, simply named \"KITTEE,\" symbolizes playfulness and approachability, evoking familiar cultural icons like viral cat videos, memes such as Grumpy Cat or Nyan Cat, and the broader \"cat economy\" in crypto. The token's branding uses \"KTE\" or \"KITTEE\" as symbols of support for these ideals, blending whimsy with decentralized principles. Culturally, KITTEE ties into the meme economy, where digital assets represent shared jokes, identities, and communities rather than traditional value stores. It's not tied to any specific real-world events or narratives but draws from the evergreen appeal of cats in online humor. The project's artwork, including the transparent logo, features a cute, cartoonish cat design that encourages meme creation, sharing, and remixing by the community.","links":"https://kittee.shop","market_cap":9877.97,"market_cap_rank":11209,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kittee-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"DN1sKvPYqht7Lx2AkhsVeMYGR53rVav1iJzygmstpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/DN1sKvPYqht7Lx2AkhsVeMYGR53rVav1iJzygmstpump"}},"is_native":false}
