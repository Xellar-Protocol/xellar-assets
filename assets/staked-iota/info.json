{"name":"Staked IOTA","id":"staked-iota","symbol":"stiota","description":"Swirl is a Liquid Staking solution, allowing users to stake IOTA and receive stIOTA in return. These tokens provide instant liquidity, enabling users to trade, use them as collateral in DeFi, or earn additional rewards while their IOTA remains staked. stIOTA is the liquid staking token issued by Swirl when users stake their IOTA. It represents a redeemable claim on staked IOTA, allowing users to: - Maintain liquidity while earning staking rewards. - Trade stIOTA on secondary markets. - Use it as collateral in DeFi protocols for additional yield opportunities. As staking rewards accrue, the value of stIOTA increases relative to IOTA, ensuring users benefit from staking while retaining flexibility and composability in the IOTA DeFi ecosystem.","links":"https://swirlstake.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/staked-iota/logo.png","detail_platform":{"iota":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x346778989a9f57480ec3fee15f2cd68409c73a62112d40a3efd13987997be68c::cert::CERT"}}}
