{"name":"Typen","id":"typen","symbol":"typen","description":"Typen is Crynode's first MVP AI Agent designed to interact with both people and other AI agents. It leverages a combination of state-of-the-art AI models and advanced machine learning techniques to think, analyze, and navigate the Solana blockchain. Typen’s architecture is custom-built and advanced, setting it apart from starter frameworks like Eliza (ai16z), as shown by the depth of his responses. He’s built for head-to-head competition with shallow AIs like $goat (Terminal of Truths), aiming to provide real value rather than just entertainment. Typen represents the first pillar of Crynode's long-term vision: a future where high-quality AIs cooperate with humans to create sustainable, long-term wealth.","links":"https://crynode.com","market_cap":7585.88,"market_cap_rank":9844,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/typen/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"G3RdswoDRpEbWFCm2GYGQz42gnFWFF1jW6q5aKXzpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/G3RdswoDRpEbWFCm2GYGQz42gnFWFF1jW6q5aKXzpump"}}}
