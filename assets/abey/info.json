{"name":"Abey","id":"abey","symbol":"abey","description":"ABEYCHAIN is a fully functioning multi-layered, programmable blockchain for high-volume transactions. The blockchain provides a decentralized storage ecosystem that is second to none in the industry. While supporting high-volume transactions using sharding and the ABEY Virtual Machine (AVM). Simply put, ABEYCHAIN got there before Ethereum. Most blockchains use single consensual mechanisms like proof of work or proof of stake. ABEYCHAIN blockchain uses a double consensus mechanism by implementing a secure proof of work and delegated proof of stake hybrid consensus. This hybridization helps to solve an issue commonly known as the “Impossible Triangle.” The triangle consists of a high degree of decentralization, security, and efficiency. ABEYCHAIN provides a solution to this for users of the blockchain. Creating an ecosystem where users can count on high-speed transactions, cross-chain interoperability, and a growing base of decentralized applications in a fast-expanding ecosystem. All of this in a developer-friendly environment. The ABEYCHAIN blockchain also possesses the ability to scale to 10,000 transactions per second (TPS). Providing fast and efficient transactions, and eliminating network congestion which leads to high network fees.","links":"https://www.abeychain.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/abey/logo.png"}
