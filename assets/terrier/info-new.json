{"name":"TERRIER","id":"terrier","symbol":"bull","description":"Terrier offers tools to speed up and improve token research for investors. Our slogan is \"DYOR - smarter, faster, better\". We have been working on our tools since October 2023, first as Telegram bots (and on-chain scam alerts), but recently we have released our first version of our online interface as well. We provide a wide range of Al-and ML-assisted analytics for ETH and SOL tokens, such as in-depth token analysis, social media analysis, sniper analysis, and holder PNL analysis just to name a few. We are aiming to be market leaders in the research and security field. Our project is still in its early stages, with dozens of new utilities and analytics on the way (among them a multi-chain, multi-wallet PNL tracker, alpha wallet tracker, best config parameters, airdrop farming, smart contract auditing service, etc). We have grown organically so far without any marketing activities.","links":"https://terrier.app/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/terrier/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb418ded94300913fccbef784a49150f46f0fb827"}}}
