{"name":"Nowarshiba","id":"nowarshiba","symbol":"nshiba","description":"NoWarShiba is a meme cryptocurrency token operating on Binance Smart Chain. Nowarshiba is different from other typical meme tokens because the team is doxxed and based in Korea. We use 2 percent of the transaction tax as marketing funds, and we also use it as another part of Ukraine's war zone. It's a rally of support for the war or for the underprivileged.","links":"http://nowarshiba.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nowarshiba/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xbdb2c4ea9e904e71c7d95cb5b9017377f8847a39"}}}
