{"name":"CookieSale","id":"cookiesale","symbol":"cookie","description":"CookieSale is a decentralized Launchpad that provides users the means to create their own token, generate initial liquidity, and list it for sale to the public. Our user-friendly interface provides a smooth and easy process operable by even the most novice of crypto users. All of our functions can be implemented without writing a single line of code. CookieSale deviates from the industry standard of taking a percentage of your token supply as a condition for launching an IDO. We believe that your tokens belong to your project and its investors, not our wallets. In other words, those are your cookies, and we aren't going anywhere near them! On top of this, we provide more services and greater functionality to our users for less. We rise above the competition with modernized and customizable smart contracts, tighter anti-scam measures, and the integration of the Pitch marketing agency into our platform. Unlike centralized exchanges, CookieSale gives users complete ownership and control of their crypto assets. CookieSale can be used by anyone directly via a web3 wallet dApp without any KYC verification procedure.","links":"https://cookiesale.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cookiesale/logo.png"}
