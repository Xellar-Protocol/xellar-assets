Meet Pomato One plant, two crops: tomatoes above ground, potatoes below.Pomato is not a new species or a genetically modified organism.It is a product of natural horticultural grafting, joining tomato and potato together into a single living system. Gardeners have discovered that Pomato is an ideal solution for urban spaces. While some report that the split of energy between tubers and fruit can affect yield and flavor, it remains a remarkable space-saving option for anyone seeking to maximize harvests. The grafting of Pomato creates natural resilience, enhancing its resistance to disease, seasons, and environment. It thrives even under harsher conditions, maintaining stability and growth.What makes it extraordinary is its simplicity: no laboratories, no genetic modification, no costly patents—just the craft of human hands creating a miracle. Because of this, Pomato is profoundly universal. Whether in the hands of a smallholder farmer in Kenya or a hobby gardener in London, it doubles harvests without adding labor. It is low-barrier, high-intelligence—an idea that expands the possibilities of future food production. The astonishing cultivation process of pomato crops, backed by scientific evidence, has yielded a bountiful chimera","links":"https://pomatotoken.xyz/","market_cap":1719.04,"market_cap_rank":13052,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pomato_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"3gfm611yupHrsZ34hc5K87Q6pWXx6zLwL481hQq3rGMA","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/3gfm611yupHrsZ34hc5K87Q6pWXx6zLwL481hQq3rGMA"}},"is_native":false}
