{"name":"Hinted Data","id":"hinted-data_solana","symbol":"hint","description":"Hinted is a data marketplace built for the new internet. It enables users to buy and sell valuable datasets—from B2B leads to intent-based consumer data—through a transparent, blockchain-powered platform. Hinted bridges the gap between traditional Web2 data practices and the emerging Web3 economy, offering decentralized tools and tokenized rewards. The platform features a hybrid model: enterprise clients buy data off-platform via fiat, while Web3 users can access the same datasets on-platform using the $HINT token. This structure funds recurring token buybacks and creates a sustainable ecosystem for all participants.","links":"https://www.hinted.com/","market_cap":53608,"market_cap_rank":8109,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/hinted-data_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"6GYrrhBy3s6LPgLdrvfd8i6HvhsgmQDEFP7zmNvZyBLV","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/6GYrrhBy3s6LPgLdrvfd8i6HvhsgmQDEFP7zmNvZyBLV"}},"is_native":false}
