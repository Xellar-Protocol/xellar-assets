{"name":"SOL Roulette","id":"sol-roulette","symbol":"roulette","description":"Sol Roulette is a unique reflection token built on the Solana blockchain that integrates a jackpot mechanism into its core tokenomics. Every transaction incurs a 10% fee that is redistributed every 10 minutes – 4% is shared proportionally among all eligible holders and 6% is awarded to one randomly selected holder who holds at least 1,000,000 tokens. This system incentivizes holding by providing regular rewards while adding an element of excitement through periodic jackpot draws. The design is intended to blend deflationary mechanics with gamification to create an engaging, community-driven ecosystem.","links":"https://www.solroulette.money","market_cap":2898.19,"market_cap_rank":10334,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/sol-roulette/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"RRiB8JNqJvSQ3YJqFASQ3h5BBHPK1KHFrHgCFhxHjoM","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/RRiB8JNqJvSQ3YJqFASQ3h5BBHPK1KHFrHgCFhxHjoM"}}}
