{"name":"EASE","id":"ease","symbol":"ease","description":"Ease.orgâ€™s mission is to help make DeFi easy and safe for everyone to use. Our main product Uninsurance offers free coverage for carefully selected popular DeFi vaults deposits while auto-compounding the yield. Only when a hack happens will users pay a fee -the cost is shared between all users and vaults- while being fully covered all the time. Q1 2022 Armor has rebranded to Ease DeFi (ease.org) which will focus on the new Uninsurance product line which was built from scratch by the new team. In September 2022 the new $EASE token was launched, based on completely new Tokenomics, including staking, Growing Vote tokens and bribing. The previous $Armor and $vArmor governance tokens can be swapped 1:1 to $EASE Tokenomics - The $EASE token is a tradeable Ethereum-based (ERC-20) token with a finite supply. It offers various levels of utility in the Ease DeFi Uninsurance system. $EASE Token Supply: - 750 million $Ease tokens have been minted. - The contract allows for additional minting of $Ease tokens, up to a max of 250 million extra tokens. The maximum total supply could therefore be 1 billion. - This can only happen after a DAO vote, the team itself cannot mint extra tokens.","links":"https://ease.org","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ease/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xea5edef1287afdf9eb8a46f9773abfc10820c61c"}}}
