{"name":"AuraFarming","id":"aurafarming_solana","symbol":"aurafarm","description":"Aura Farming is a cultural phenomenon that swept social media platforms like TikTok and X in 2025, redefining how people project charisma in the digital age. At its core, Aura Farming is about cultivating and showcasing an effortless, magnetic presence—referred to as \"aura\"—through carefully crafted moments of coolness, style, or wit. The term \"aura\" in this context symbolizes an intangible blend of charisma, confidence, and mystique. To \"farm\" it, users post short videos or images capturing themselves in scenarios designed to amplify this vibe: a perfectly timed hair flip, a slow-motion walk with a smirk, or a clever one-liner delivered with deadpan humor. These acts are often exaggerated for effect, poking fun at the idea of trying too hard to appear effortlessly cool. The hashtag #AuraFarm exploded, racking up millions of views as creators competed to outdo each other’s aura points.","links":"https://aurafarming.io/","market_cap":185933,"market_cap_rank":6026,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/aurafarming_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"4rwPNRSFgcS7EGphFdX7VwXuhjZGxph7gYyb7Zp2pump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/4rwPNRSFgcS7EGphFdX7VwXuhjZGxph7gYyb7Zp2pump"}},"is_native":false}
