{"name":"Darwinia Network xRING","id":"darwinia-network-xring_ethereum","symbol":"xring","description":"Darwinia Network provides a cross-chain smart contract platform and message port network. RING is the native token of Darwinia Network, while xRING facilitates the seamless migration of RING from Ethereum to other Layer 2 solutions. In the latest update of the Darwinia-Ethereum Bridge, several significant changes were introduced, including the adoption of a streamlined and abstract XToken v3 protocol. Additionally, the underlying messaging service has switched to Msgport and ORMP. The update also introduced an optional xRING token on Ethereum, improving compatibility with Ethereum Layer 2 solutions. This xRING can be wrapped 1:1 into RING or unwrapped from RING, ensuring their equivalence.
