{"name":"BIOS","id":"bios-2_solana","symbol":"bios","description":"Biosphere3 is an open-ended agent evolution arena and large-scale multi-agent social simulation experiment. Inspired by Biosphere 2, the 1990s closed ecological system project, Biosphere3 simulates real-world societies and evolutionary processes within a digital sandbox. It is also designed as a Citizen Science Game to engage more intelligent agents and human participants. The project is primarily supported by the HKUST Crypto-Fintech Lab and led by Prof. Yang Wang, Vice-President of HKUST, and Prof. Kani Chen. It is developed collaboratively by a team of mathematicians, PhD candidates, AI algorithm engineers, etc. All agent frameworks and experimental data are open-sourced, aiming to invite and attract more scholars, developers, and agent architecture communities to join our ecosystem. Together, we strive to accelerate the advent of Artificial Superintelligence (ASI).","links":"https://biosphere3.ai/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bios-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"DWDnYfhVMnNBbWz4uEVvLVZLdYQoSuBosSU2vmHSpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/DWDnYfhVMnNBbWz4uEVvLVZLdYQoSuBosSU2vmHSpump"}},"is_native":false}
