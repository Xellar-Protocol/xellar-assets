{"name":"sUSDe ARM LP Token","id":"usde-arm-lp-token_ethereum","symbol":"arm-susde-usde","description":"The Origin USDe ARM is a vault that purchases Ethena's sUSDe when it goes below its peg and converts it into USDe to earn an arbitrage profit. The USDe is then recycled back to purchase more sUSDe. If purchasing sUSDe below peg is not possible, the vault lends the USDe to an Aave market to earn a baseline yield. This ARM is similar to the Lido ARM, which has handled more than 500,000 ETH in volume. Developed by the team at Origin Protocol.","links":"https://www.originprotocol.com/arm","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/usde-arm-lp-token_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xceda2d856238aa0d12f6329de20b9115f07c366d","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xceda2d856238aa0d12f6329de20b9115f07c366d"}},"is_native":false}
