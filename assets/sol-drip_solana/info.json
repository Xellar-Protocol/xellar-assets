{"name":"SOL DRIP","id":"sol-drip_solana","symbol":"drip","description":"$DRIP is a reward token that delivers Solana ($SOL) to holders every 5 minutes. No trading volume? No problem. You’ll still receive $SOL rewards every 5 minutes—rain or shine. This isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a game-changing project built to reward holders consistently, no matter what the market is doing. The power behind $DRIP lies in its Treasury—specifically, a dedicated distribution wallet that holds tokens solely for the purpose of rewarding $SOL. This wallet is locked and untouchable, meaning the tokens stay there permanently, continuously generating and distributing $SOL. Beyond passive rewards, $DRIP will also be used in real-world utility—like tipping and earning in online games and more. It’s innovation with real use and real rewards.","links":"https://soldrip.me","market_cap":79779,"market_cap_rank":7415,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/sol-drip/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"w131jbryFvFEmtqmZvx42Meiuc4Drmu3nodTdVgkREV","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/w131jbryFvFEmtqmZvx42Meiuc4Drmu3nodTdVgkREV"}},"is_native":false}
