Built by a team from top web3 projects, AAA titles, Blizzard, Activision, Ubisoft & Unity. Backed by industry leaders: Animoca Brands, Metavest Capital, Maven Capital, Double Peek Group & many more. Engines of Fury is a top-down extraction shooter set on a harsh alternate Earth where a mutagenic virus carried by a meteor impact turned flora and fauna against humanity. Players attempt to thrive in a brutal narrative-driven world as they customize their hideout with scavenged parts found while hunting. As they build increasingly powerful armor and weapons, they will face deadly mutagenic monsters. Healing is scarce and survival requires finding extraction points before the mutants end them. Death can cost them everything they've gathered and everything they carried with them on their Raid. Single-player, Co-Op & PVPVE gameplay modes with powerful social features & $FURY token at the heart of the game. $FURY is used for: In-game convenience & cosmetics purchases; NFT mints; earning potential; UGC monetisation; Liquidity staking.","links":"https://www.eof.gg/","market_cap":1256593,"market_cap_rank":2961,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/engines-of-fury/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0203d275d2a65030889af45ed91d472be3948b92"}}}
