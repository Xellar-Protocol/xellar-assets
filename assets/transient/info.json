Increasing blockchain adoption across every sphere of industry and life. TSC-Core is the 1st Transient dApp and it allows users to create smart contracts using different features (transfer, deposit and digital signature). All without coding. CryptoPool is the 2nd dApp - it gives users the ability to crate price prediction pools for tokens. Esports - the 3rd dApp - is similar to CryptoPool in terms of pooling but it is the bridge between users and AAA games (League of Legends, DOTA, Counter Strike and others). NDA dApp - the 4th one, gives two parts the possibility of singing a contract easily through the blockchain.","links":"https://www.transientnetwork.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/transient/logo.png"}
