{"name":"DeVoid","id":"devoid_base","symbol":"dvd","description":"DeVoid is a fully automated volatility farming platform, purpose-built to capture value from nonstop price swings on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Instead of chasing pumps or speculating on the next 100x, DeVoid farms the one constant in crypto, volatility, turning chaotic market movements into compounding yield, 24/7. Unlike wrappers or forks, DeVoid was built from the ground up with one of the fastest execution engines in the market, enabling precise entries and exits across even illiquid pools. Tested through four months of simulations and live capital deployment, the platform has consistently delivered strong results, averaging around 30% monthly yield from volatility farming alone. DeVoid is designed for all traders: professionals can fine-tune granular strategies, while newcomers can start instantly with pre-tuned templates proven in live markets. Once parameters are set, the system loops indefinitely, no manual babysitting required. With one click to start and infinite ways to optimize, DeVoid makes it possible to farm volatility correctly and reliably.","links":"https://devoid.trade/","market_cap":59406,"market_cap_rank":7930,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/devoid/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x911abc29f0dbdec68c01d58d67877887b5e651d8","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x911abc29f0dbdec68c01d58d67877887b5e651d8"}},"is_native":false}
