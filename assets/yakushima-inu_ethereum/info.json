{"name":"Yakushima Inu","id":"yakushima-inu_ethereum","symbol":"yaku","description":"The Yakushima Inu: Japan's Rarest Dog Breed The Yakushima Inu, a rare breed from Yakushima Island, Japan, is a medium-sized Spitz-type dog bred for wild boar hunting. Its wolf-like nature and elusive history fascinate enthusiasts. Crossbreeding with other breeds has made purebreds nearly extinct, leaving its status uncertain and documentation scarce. Renowned for loyalty and intelligence, the Yakushima Inu thrived in Yakushima’s rugged forests. Unlike recognized Nihon Ken breeds, it lacks official designation, adding to its obscurity. Its sturdy build and thick coat suited the island’s terrain, but limited records hinder defining clear breed standards. With few, if any, purebred Yakushima Inus left, preservation is challenging. Enthusiasts may connect with Japanese breeder networks to learn more. Its rarity emphasizes the need for conservation to protect this unique piece of Japan’s canine heritage from disappearing entirely.","links":"https://yakushimainu.dog","market_cap":24348,"market_cap_rank":9405,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/yakushima-inu_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xffd228cf984815b071ceb20c368dc98a122b56a7","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xffd228cf984815b071ceb20c368dc98a122b56a7"}},"is_native":false}
