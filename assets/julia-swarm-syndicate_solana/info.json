{"name":"Julia Swarm Syndicate","id":"julia-swarm-syndicate_solana","symbol":"jss","description":"Julia Swarm Syndicate (JSS) is a next-generation crypto trading platform built on the Julia programming language and focused on the Solana blockchain. It uses swarm intelligence, where a decentralized group of AI agents work together—like a colony of ants or a flock of birds—to analyze data, predict market trends, and make smart trading decisions. Each agent has its own strategy. For example, the Technical Analyst uses indicators like RSI and Bollinger Bands, the Degen Trader chases fast-moving DeFi trends, and the Market Insight Trader looks at big-picture data like liquidity and market cap. These agents learn from their past performance and adjust their strategies using Julia’s machine learning tools. JSS pulls real-time market data from sources like DEXScreener and GeckoTerminal. Agents communicate and reach a group decision—buy, sell, or hold—based on majority sentiment, ensuring that the system adapts to changing conditions. The goal of JSS is to make advanced trading tools available to everyone, not just institutional investors. By combining the strengths of many agents, it gives users a clearer, more informed view of the crypto market. In the future, JSS may expand to other blockchains and allow the community to help build and improve agents through an open-source framework.","links":"https://www.swarmsyndicate.app/","market_cap":5808.74,"market_cap_rank":12142,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/julia-swarm-syndicate/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"8rUHbf6cP8ufxqKQUuRhhM5yyDKPr4tN5e5ANz8Ppump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/8rUHbf6cP8ufxqKQUuRhhM5yyDKPr4tN5e5ANz8Ppump"}},"is_native":false}
