Equinox AI is a unified data intelligence ecosystem designed to bridge on-chain and off-chain analysis. It brings together transaction tracking, behavioural pattern recognition, and identity analytics. Powered by infrastructure built to operate across decentralised networks and public platforms. From wallet movement and DeFi flows to Telegram activity and X profile behaviour, Equinox extracts context, detects anomalies, and connects signals that are often missed in isolation. It supports wallet-level insights, mixer and bridge tracing, user group analysis, and evolving social patterns. Equinox is built for researchers, analysts, and on-chain users who need more than fragmented tools. It's a modular stack that scales from surface-level scanning to deep behavioural intelligence, without compromising on accuracy or privacy.","links":"https://equinoxai.app/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/equinox-ai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x110c44bb14408a2f008a67ed3398191b64c31247","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x110c44bb14408a2f008a67ed3398191b64c31247"}}}
