{"name":"Valannium","id":"valannium_solana","symbol":"valan","description":"Valannia is a fantasy gaming ecosystem on Solana that connects multiple titles through a unified player identity, shared asset layer, and on-chain ownership. The project aims to let heroes, units, items, and materials move across games while retaining consistent progression and art direction. Core components include Realms, a browser-based MMO focused on professions, gathering, refining, crafting, and dungeon loops, and Arena, a competitive combat experience developed as a standalone title and linked through account and asset services. A central Portal provides account management, inventory, marketplace access, and cross-game utilities.","links":"https://www.valannia.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/valannium/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"5cL3TVJ7p5ZKqyx16DXwpdcNx5u19vQtWujA9vYindi","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/5cL3TVJ7p5ZKqyx16DXwpdcNx5u19vQtWujA9vYindi"}},"is_native":false}
