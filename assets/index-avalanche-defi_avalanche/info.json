Brokkr makes DeFi investing effortless by providing a suite of indexes, DCA and automated strategies. IXAD is one of the tokens that represents the liquidity in one of Brokkr's indexes specifically one that represents DeFi index on Avalanche chain. What makes your project unique? Brokkr strives to automate all of the strategies they offer to enable truly decentralized way of investing into DeFi without any intermediaries. History of your project. Brokkr started building our project on Terra where it deployed a delta neutral strategy. Unfortunately Terra crashed but Brokkr managed to survive. After that most of the work was put towards rebuilding on a new chain (Avalanche) and now they want to expand across multiple ecosystems. What’s next for your project? Brokkr shall expand the amount of indexes it has and connect them with decentralized DCA which is also developed by Brokkr. Brokkr will also expand to more chains. What can your token be used for? The token represents a DeFi index on Avalanche, which would fit into the category of DeFi Index coins on coingecko. The token can be minted to invest into the token index or burned to withdraw from it, essentially it works similar to a liquidity providing token.","links":"https://app.brokkr.finance/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/index-avalanche-defi_avalanche/logo.png","detail_platform":{"avalanche":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa9ef87eb3fdc2f08ef5ee401326f7331d4d312cf"}},"is_native":false}
