It fuses large language model intelligence with strategic tokenomics to create a sustainable, profit-sharing ecosystem. In a market driven by emotion and noise, AIM replaces guesswork with precision. Our ensemble of LLMs — including GPT, Claude, and more — continuously analyzes market data, news, sentiment, and on-chain activity to generate real-time trading decisions. The system is fully autonomous, operating without human intervention, and supports multiple portfolio strategies such as momentum, mean reversion, and arbitrage.
