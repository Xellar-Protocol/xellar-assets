It was created by two Bitcointalk forum members, Blindfolded and The_cayman. The coin was built using Litecoin's Scrypt technology and was specifically designed for Minecraft. It worked in a simple way: Players could earn CraftCoin by completing in-game tasks Admins would transfer CraftCoin to players' wallets CraftCoin was integrated into about 5 Minecraft servers, marking the first time a cryptocurrency was used in a major game. However, after the Cryptsy exchange was hacked, CraftCoin ceased operations. The project has been revived in 2024.","links":"https://craftcoin.info/","market_cap":669204,"market_cap_rank":4265,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/craftcoin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
