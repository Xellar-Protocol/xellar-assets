Furthermore, by collaborating with other members of the community, agents may obtain the potential to earn profits within the virtual ecosystem. The foundational items of the xSPECTAR society are the native token and NFTs which will grant members access to the exclusive society and unlock the privileges in all lines of utility. Through the native NFT of xSPECTAR, users will gain private access to the xSPECTAR society and the benefits offered within it. Each xSPECTAR NFT is a unique agent - avatar and your ultimate access ticket. The NFTs are high-quality 3D characters made by the award-winning character company REBLIKA. The native token (XSPECTAR), with a maximum supply of 88.8 million tokens, is the key to entering, collaborating and engaging within the ecosystem.
