{"name":"Piction Network","id":"piction-network","symbol":"pxl","description":"Piction Network is creating a new peer to peer digital contents ecosystem. We are disrupting the centralized models of content distribution dominated by extractive intermediaries. We intend to build an ecosystem where all participants will co-exist for the healthy growth of the digital content market. Equality of opportunity should be guaranteed for many creators through low entry barriers. The final consumer should not go beyond simple purchasing but expand opportunities for the rights and participation as consumers in the content market. In addition, by creating an open market and eliminating unnecessary intermediary operators, content distributors are expected to benefit from the sharing of reasonable revenues.","links":"https://piction.network/en/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/piction-network/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf88951d7b676798705fd3a362ba5b1dbca2b233b"}}}
