{"name":"XiamiPool","id":"xiamipool","symbol":"xmpt","description":"XiaMiFishing is a DeFi application based on a NFT protocol launched by XiaMi Pool. NFT stands for \"Non-Fungible Token\" and has the characteristics of being indivisible, irreplaceable, and unique. In the XiaMi Fishing, each fishing boat is given a unique number which cannot be replicated. Users can interact with smart contracts to obtain fishing boats, transform them, destroy them, and exchange them for cash. Users can even earn income from fishing in the sea. We hope to revitalize the public's perception of blockchain through this simple and fun DAPP.","links":"https://www.xiamipool.com","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/xiamipool/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8099c0c7b3e530f563d4b121abd2ee365c72fb78"}}}
