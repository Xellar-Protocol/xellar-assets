A novel money market architecture, Personal Collateral Escrows, ensures that different tokens from different users are not co-mingled. DOLA, a synthetic stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar. It is designed to be valued as close to $1 as possible with minimal volatility. DOLA is debt-backed rather than algorithmic, meaning that DOLA is backed by retractable debt. sDOLA, a yield-bearing, synthetic stablecoin that derives its yield from Inverse Finance’s FiRM fixed rate lending market revenues. Users who stake DOLA receive a constant stream of DBR’s, which are auto-compounded into more DOLA, resulting in yield-bearing sDOLA. and: DBR, or \"DOLA Borrowing Right,\" a new DeFi primitive that represents your right to borrow DOLA in FiRM, Inverse's fixed rate lending protocol. FiRM doesn't use interest rates per se but instead uses borrowing rights, which are akin to tokenized interest rates. A user with a single DBR has the right to borrow one DOLA stablecoin for up to one year with no interest.","links":"https://inverse.finance/","market_cap":13839732,"market_cap_rank":1119,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/inverse-finance/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x41d5d79431a913c4ae7d69a668ecdfe5ff9dfb68"}}}
