{"name":"wenlambo","id":"wenlambo-3","symbol":"wenlambo","description":"WenLambo is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain that embraces meme culture by referencing the iconic “Wen Lambo?” phrase, symbolizing speculative enthusiasm in crypto. It has a fixed supply of 10 million tokens, no presale, no team allocation, and a renounced contract. The project is deflationary through token buybacks and burns, with no promised utility or roadmap, reflecting a purely community-driven experiment.","links":"https://wenlambo.vip/","market_cap":8578.32,"market_cap_rank":11056,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wenlambo-3/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x340d7adda2a709e488faf443612ca69eac063a80","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x340d7adda2a709e488faf443612ca69eac063a80"}}}
