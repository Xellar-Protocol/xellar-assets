{"name":"Big Tom Coin","id":"big-tom-coin","symbol":"btc","description":"Big Tom Coin is a meme-powered community project on Base, inspired by the iconic Giga Chad drawing by Matt Furie (2023). Big Tom is more than a character — he’s the face of onchain swagger, positivity, and good vibes. The project exists purely for cultural impact and community connection, with no inherent value or promised utility. Holders rally around Big Tom for the memes, the movement, and the mission to bring fun, friendship, and AI-powered energy to the blockchain.","links":"https://www.bigtomcoin.com","market_cap":7635.02,"market_cap_rank":11153,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/big-tom-coin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x35c8afb7d3ad01b154a5e8e0f92f31181d101a3d","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x35c8afb7d3ad01b154a5e8e0f92f31181d101a3d"}}}
