Project Use Cases SafeMoneyBSC is a yield and liquidity generation protocol by SafeMoneyBSC Bank Digital. SafeMoneyBSC employs 5 simple functions. Static Rewards + LP Acquisition Wallet + Burn + DeFi Wallet + Marketing Wallet. In each trade, the transaction is taxed a 13% fee, which is split 3 ways. Aside from this default feature , the SafeMoneyBSC ecosystem contains a few intriguing projects, each with ground-breaking innovation. SafeMoneyBSC Unique BuyBack Function The strategic buyback fee funds the SafeMoneyBSC buyback function, also known as The Kraken. Once the contract collects 1 BNB worth of SafeMoneyBSC from the transaction fees, it converts (sells SafeMoneyBSC) for BNB and locks that BNB back into the SafeMoneyBSC contract (while also sending the appropriate allocation to the project sustainability wallet). Transaction Fee Breakdown 5% - Rewards to Holders 3% - Project Sustainability 5% - Strategic Buyback\"","links":"https://safemoney.exchange/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/safemoneybsc/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x740b4c277a94cc781ec9da438d2eb12f75deee46"}}}
