{"name":"FOMO RADIO AI","id":"fomo-radio-ai","symbol":"radio","description":"FOMO FM introduces the world’s first AI-driven voice synthesis platform tailored for the crypto ecosystem. By blending natural language processing (NLP), real-time voice synthesis, and persona engineering, FOMO FM transforms the way users interact with dynamic data. Inspired by Elon Musk’s vision for X as the ultimate “source of truth,” FOMO FM addresses the inherent biases of traditional media. As Musk stated, “You are the media,” emphasizing the democratization of information. FOMO FM takes this concept further, creating an unbiased, AI-driven platform that ensures every voice is heard and every insight is delivered accurately and transparently. https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1780370067987009711 The platform’s first use case, an AI radio, delivers engaging audio shows hosted by custom personas like RJ Degen and RJ Diana, offering a glimpse into the future of voice-driven media. To kick things off, FOMO Radio AI is starting with its flagship Funny Bunny Show, where RJ Degen brings the latest crypto buzz every 15 minutes with a mix of wit and precision. But this is just the beginning — future plans include adding more autonomous shows like Market Insights and Crypto Price Alerts, each designed to redefine how you consume audio content.","links":"https://fomofm.show/","market_cap":1788598,"market_cap_rank":3367,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/fomo-radio-ai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"B4gipVUHKJ7keVN3MWEYDQCHjkdoXGsbmZoTSJDZpump"}}}
