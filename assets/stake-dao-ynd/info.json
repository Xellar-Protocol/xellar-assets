{"name":"Stake DAO YND","id":"stake-dao-ynd","symbol":"sdynd","description":"I'll search for current information about YieldNest (YND) and Stake DAO's sdYND liquid locker token, as this appears to be a recent development not covered in the provided documentation.Based on my search, here's a short explanation of **sdYND**: **sdYND** is Stake DAO's liquid locker token for YieldNest's governance token (YND). YND holders can stake their tokens via Stake DAO's Liquid Locker system, receiving sdYND tokens that unlock compounding rewards and simple governance participation without the complexity of managing on-chain voting directly. **Key features:** - **Liquidity**: Users receive sdYND tokens, which can be traded or utilized in DeFi protocols, ensuring funds remain accessible - **Flexibility**: Users can merge or unmerge positions at their convenience without the extended waiting periods of traditional locking mechanisms - **Delegated governance** participation (though with limited direct voting compared to holding veYND directly) This is particularly relevant as YieldNest's Token Generation Event (TGE) took place on June 3, 2025, making sdYND a brand new addition to Stake DAO's liquid locker ecosystem. YieldNest manages over $500 million in Total Value Locked (TVL) and focuses on merging DeFi, restaking, and RWA strategies into high-yield assets.","links":"https://www.stakedao.org/lockers","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/stake-dao-ynd/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
