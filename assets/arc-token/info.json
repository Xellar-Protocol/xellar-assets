{"name":"Arc Protocol","id":"arc-token","symbol":"arc","description":"\"ARC is a Node Protocol that works via a ludic DApp inspired by Sci-Fi. We took the best of each node protocol to establish a sustainable tokenomics system that will run in the long term. The project is based on three fundamental pillars: 1.Sustainability: Tokenomics thinked to last in the long term, from the start of the project. The yield of the nodes can go up to 1.05% per day maximum. 2.Scalability: Holders can merge nodes together to upgrade them to higher tiers. (A function that lacks in others nodes protocols) 3.Utility: Full node RPC endpoints. The protocol has an unpredictable buyback system to avoid swing traders. With the income of the protocol, a treasury is created. The treasury is invested in various high-yield investments. Benefits will be reinjected into the protocol.\"","links":"https://arctoken.space/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/arc-token/logo.png"}
