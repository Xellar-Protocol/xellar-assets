The team builds the first Vote To Earn system. Through the NFT staking, holders who own an NFT can receive their HAKI airdrop per month to earn passive rewards. With the Auto Lp Burn, HAKI's supply is reduced by every day, making it deflationary. The team consists of experienced developers who have been working in the crypto branch since 2017.
