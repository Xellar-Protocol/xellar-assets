{"name":"AstraPad","id":"astrapad","symbol":"astra","description":"AstraPad is a Solana-based decentralized launchpad platform. We strive to build a community-run IDO launchpad, we want it to be fair and accessible. We put a lot of emphasis into Community Governance, giving our investors a chance to vote on the projects and other major or minor decisions. The AstraPad incubator makes it a lot more accessible for everyone to play a part in the process and get their share of IDO tokens without active involvement or a huge sum of money.","links":"https://astrapad.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/astrapad/logo.png"}
