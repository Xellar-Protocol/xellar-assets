{"name":"Envion","id":"envion","symbol":"evn","description":"Envion has created the technology for the first truly mobile mining unit (MMU) that uses low-priced local energy to mine a broad spectrum of cryptocurrencies. By harvesting locally available clean energy right at the source, Envion can operate at a lower cost than competitors and at the same time reduce the CO2 footprint of the blockchain industry. Envion aims at decentralizing the highly-concentrated mining market and at bringing back control of the market to the users. Hence, profits generated by MMUs are 100% beneficial to token holders. Distribution of profit dividends will occur on a weekly basis: 75% of profits will be emitted, while 25% will be used to reinvest directly in MMUs, in order to guarantee exponentially growing profits to the envion community.","links":"https://www.envion.org/en/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/envion/logo.png"}
