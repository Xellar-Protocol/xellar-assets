{"name":"Prospera Tax Credit","id":"prospera-tax-credit","symbol":"ptc","description":"Prospera Tax Credits are transferable credits that can be used to pay taxes or other fees by anyone living or doing business within Próspera’s jurisdiction. They can be purchased from the issuing authority at a 33-76% discount. PTC tokens are currently minted on Ethereum and Solana, and are transferable between compatible blockchain wallets. You can purchase pre-minted PTCs on the open market or obtain them from the issuer, Próspera ZEDE. To obtain PTCs from Próspera ZEDE, there is a three-step process, due to strong Know-Your-Customer, Anti-Money Laundering, and Anti-Terrorism Financing safeguards. STEP ONE: Become an (e)Resident at eProspera.hn. STEP TWO: Buy Tax Credits Fill out a form to buy Tax Credits. Depending on how much you spend in one transaction, you can receive between 1.5x and 4.25x in USD tax credit value for every $1.00 USD spent (Qualifying Cryptocurrency is accepted too). For example, if you are spending $100.00 USD, you can expect to receive a tax credit value of $150.00 USD. STEP THREE: Mint PTCs Mint your PTCs by emailing your tax credit certificate, together with your ETH or SOL wallet address (future PTCs will deploy using BTC and other blockchain technologies). One (1) PTC will be minted for each $1.00 USD of tax credit value you exchange, less applicable fees.","links":"https://prospera.hn/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/prospera-tax-credit/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
