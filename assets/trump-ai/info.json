{"name":"Trump AI","id":"trump-ai","symbol":"$traimp","description":"The memecoin project $TRAIMP aims to capture the explosive combination of artificial intelligence, internet meme culture, and the personality of Donald Trump to create a unique token in the crypto market. $TRAIMP leverages a community-driven model, attracting enthusiasts who resonate with both the unpredictability of the memecoin landscape and the larger-than-life persona of Trump. With an ambitious roadmap, $TRAIMP aspires to dominate the memecoin sector by not only building a substantial following but by differentiating itself with an AI-powered ecosystem designed to drive engagement, innovation, and virality. At the core of $TRAIMP is its community-first philosophy. Memecoins thrive on active and dedicated followings, and $TRAIMP has fostered a decentralized community with a focus on collective growth and influence. Unlike traditional financial assets, $TRAIMP’s value is as much a function of social sentiment and internet buzz as it is of technical development. Community members play an integral role in marketing, content creation, and even in guiding the project’s direction. By actively engaging with its audience on platforms like Twitter, Telegram, and Reddit, $TRAIMP taps into the same energy that propelled earlier memecoins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. However, $TRAIMP aims to go beyond mere popularity to achieve lasting impact and, potentially, mass adoption.","links":"https://traimp.wtf","market_cap":48563,"market_cap_rank":6779,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/trump-ai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"TrUPjEqGpUph6sMJX8C3yYja9u4RcVUGTCkGG4xLrjG"}}}
