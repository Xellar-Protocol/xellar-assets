With Klayr, thatâ€™s about to change. As a Layer 1 blockchain built with rock-solid, established technology, Klayr is positioned to provide a platform where developers, creators, and a thriving community of token-holders and validators can come together.

Klayr, Web3 for the new generation.","links":"https://klayr.xyz","market_cap":2034165,"market_cap_rank":2571,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/klayr/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
