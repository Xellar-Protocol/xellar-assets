{"name":"Drip Network","id":"drip-network","symbol":"drip","description":"DRIP can be deposited into the Faucet Contract to provide a consistent 1% daily return (up to 365% of initial principal amount) for participation over time. Income comes from 10% taxes on exchanges and referrals. A reservoir is also available to provide wBNB rewards. DRIP is the only deflationary daily ROI token that pays stakers and referrers from a tax on transactions and not through inflation.","links":"https://drip.community/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/drip-network/logo.png"}
