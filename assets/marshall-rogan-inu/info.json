{"name":"Marshall Inu","id":"marshall-rogan-inu","symbol":"mri","description":"Marshall Inu is a token on the Ethereum blockchain who’s mission is to pay UFC fighers, and fighters in general, a fair pay for their fights. It will pay fighters during training, and also add to their fight night purse to ensure they get paid fairly for their efforts. $MRI is based off the world renowned Shiba Inu, but it has actual utility rather than simply being a “meme” token.","links":"https://www.marshallinu.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/marshall-rogan-inu/logo.png"}
