{"name":"SatLayer Restaked uniBTC","id":"satlayer-restaked-unibtc","symbol":"satunibtc","description":"SatLayer is a modular security protocol designed to extend Bitcoin’s security to broader blockchain ecosystems. It enables users to restake Bitcoin liquid staking tokens (LSTs) to secure decentralized applications and infrastructure, referred to as Bitcoin Validated Services (BVS). Through this mechanism, SatLayer facilitates Bitcoin-based shared security for Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks, while allowing participants to earn additional yield on their restaked Bitcoin assets. The protocol supports a decentralized operator marketplace and includes slashing mechanisms to maintain accountability and network safety.","links":"https://satlayer.xyz/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/satlayer-restaked-unibtc/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""},"ethereum":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"0xf7de2b7afdb07aa5dd143180ed758165821e076e","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xf7de2b7afdb07aa5dd143180ed758165821e076e"},"berachain":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"0x2a5fc05f71cfc54ddcad19457cee79e3aaf415c9","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/berachain/tokens/0x2a5fc05f71cfc54ddcad19457cee79e3aaf415c9"},"bitlayer":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"0x4fdb0511f1e5c6c215596570f855cb1f9924b8b6","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bitlayer/tokens/0x4fdb0511f1e5c6c215596570f855cb1f9924b8b6"},"bob-network":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"0x4cbe838e2bd3b46247f80519b6ac79363298aa09","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bob-network/tokens/0x4cbe838e2bd3b46247f80519b6ac79363298aa09"}}}
