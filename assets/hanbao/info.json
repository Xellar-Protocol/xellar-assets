{"name":"Hanbao","id":"hanbao","symbol":"hanbao","description":"Hanbao, the finless porpoise, marks a significant milestone in the conservation efforts for the Yangtze finless porpoise, a species critically endangered due to human activities in its natural habitat, the Yangtze River. Here's a concise history: Birth and Naming: Hanbao was born on June 3, 2020, in Wuhan, China, at an artificial breeding environment. This event was noteworthy because Hanbao is the first second-generation Yangtze finless porpoise to be born through artificial breeding, showcasing a potential path for species conservation. The name \"Hanbao\" was chosen through a public naming contest, reflecting the Chinese word for \"hamburger\" due to its phonetic similarity and as a playful nod, engaging public interest in conservation efforts.","links":"https://hanbao.fun/","market_cap":654218,"market_cap_rank":4349,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/hanbao/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"GTFWEVQy5BwQsZJWS4Y6KaZ3or6Yhysh2EEUp8bgpump"}}}
