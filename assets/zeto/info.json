{"name":"ZeTo","id":"zeto","symbol":"ztc","description":"ZeTo is an openly medical information service platform based on EOS blockchain 3.0 technology. ZeTo integrates medical information scattered across different healthcare facilities to form a complete personal medical information database. ZeTo returns information ownership and controls back to the user themselves. Users can set or authorize different permissions to others through the ZeTo system to fully control their medical information. The medical service provider certified by the ZeTo system can add new medical information to the userâ€™s personal medical file under the authorization of the user so as to realize the data recorded on the chain, instead of storing the database on the medical institution. In that way, the fragmented information is integrated into a complete database.","links":"http://www.zeto.cc/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/zeto/logo.png","detail_platform":{"eos":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":null}}}
