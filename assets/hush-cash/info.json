{"name":"Hush.cash","id":"hush-cash","symbol":"hush","description":"Hush.cash is a privacy framework that enables shielded transactions between users and dApps on zkSync. Hush shields and transfers your onchain assets to any other zkSync address or smart contract. Deposits are redeemable within seconds, but can be accessed later to improve anonymity. Hush is built with established and audited Solidity libraries to ensure that deposits are secure. The HUSH token is designed to support and play a critical role in the Hush ecosystem. Holders earn their share of generated fees, and are entitled to make proposals that dictate operation of the platform.","links":"https://hush.cash/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/hush-cash/logo.png","detail_platform":{"zksync":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6d27b6252b980ba4350a1e349a3b684237d5e986"}}}
