{"name":"Kvants AI","id":"kvants-ai","symbol":"kvai","description":"Kvants AI is an integrated AI-driven asset management platform that leverages advanced quantitative strategies to serve both institutional and retail users. Its core offering is an AI Agent Governed Quantitative Hedge Fund, in which specialized AI modules operate under a central AI governance framework to dynamically select, monitor, and rebalance complex trading strategies. Kvants Plus+ extends this ecosystem by providing a non-custodial gateway to top-tier quant strategies developed by experienced hedge fund managers. Via CEX integrations (Binance, OKX, ByBit, KuCoin, and HTX), investors retain custody of their assets while engaging in fully automated, AI-driven trading. A Sentiment AI Agent further augments the platform by aggregating and analyzing real-time market data, social trends, and influencer signals to detect potential alpha at an early stage—an increasingly crucial factor in rapidly evolving cryptocurrency markets. Complementing these features is the Kvants DEX Trading Terminal, which employs a global co-location node infrastructure to mitigate latency, slippage, and front-running on Solana and EVM-compatible blockchains, offering decentralized execution speeds akin to centralized exchanges. Key traction metrics highlight over 2,000 monthly active users on Kvants Plus+, multiple onboarded quant strategies, and successful pre-seed and seed fundraising rounds. The team’s professional pedigree—spanning quantitative finance at Citigroup and JPMorgan, big-tech engineering at Tencent, and compliance expertise at Ernst & Young—provides substantial credibility. With a Token Generation Event (TGE) scheduled for January 23, 2025, Kvants AI illustrates how AI-driven quant methodologies are reshaping the centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency landscapes.","links":"https://kvants.ai/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kvants-ai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
