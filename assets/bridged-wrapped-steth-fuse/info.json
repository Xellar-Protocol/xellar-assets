{"name":"Bridged Wrapped stETH (Fuse)","id":"bridged-wrapped-steth-fuse","symbol":"wsteth","description":"Bridged Wrapped stETH (Fuse) is a wrapped version of stETH, designed to provide a DeFi-compatible token. It maintains a constant balance through an underlying share system, reflecting staking rewards without daily balance changes. This allows for seamless integrations with various DeFi protocols. wstETH is a wrapped version of stETH. Due to the nature of Lido, the amount of stETH on your balance is not constant - it changes daily as staking rewards come in. As some DeFi protocols require a constant balance mechanism for tokens, wstETH keeps your balance of stETH fixed and uses an underlying share system to reflect your staking rewards.","links":"https://fuse.io/","market_cap":15300.91,"market_cap_rank":10342,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bridged-wrapped-steth-fuse/logo.png","detail_platform":{"fuse":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x2931b47c2cee4febad348ba3d322cb4a17662c34","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/fuse/tokens/0x2931b47c2cee4febad348ba3d322cb4a17662c34"}}}
