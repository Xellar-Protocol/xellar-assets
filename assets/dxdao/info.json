{"name":"DXdao","id":"dxdao","symbol":"dxd","description":"DXdao is a collective that builds and governs decentralized products and services. Its current product suite features Omen, a prediction market; Swapr, a governance-enabled AMM; Mesa, a front-running resistant DEX; and Rails, a Layer 2 payment portal. DXdao uses a reputation-based governance system; meaning that voting power is non-transferrable and cannot be bought. DXD is an ERC20 token that powers the DXdao ecosystem and has a claim on a share of all revenue from DXdao products. DXdao is fully on-chain and minimizes its reliance on third-parties, controlling its products through ENS, and managing the treasury through binding, on-chain votes. DXdao aims to bring decentralization to DeFi and build resilient financial services for the world.","links":"https://dxdao.eth.link/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dxdao/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa1d65e8fb6e87b60feccbc582f7f97804b725521"},"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc3ae0333f0f34aa734d5493276223d95b8f9cb37"},"xdai":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":"0xb90d6bec20993be5d72a5ab353343f7a0281f158"}}}
