{"name":"Vulcano","id":"vulcano-2","symbol":"vulc","description":"Vulcano will be a video game with a Sci-Fi aesthetic. Within Vulcano, players will engage in three-character versus three-character 3D battles. Three rounds will be played, where each player will have to position their characters and equip them with a weapon if they wish. Players must adapt their moves to the strategy they believe their opponent will use to counter them. Once characters are positioned and equipped, enemy NFTs will appear and fight automatically, with each character role having different behaviors. The player who wins two of these three duels wins the match. There are three types of NFTs: characters, weapons and lands. And coming soon, spaceships. Each NFT will have a specific utility for the game. Also, each one has a set of unique skills that determine its rarity: common, rare, legendary, and mythic. These NFTs are represented in card format, and are collectible.","links":"https://www.vulcano.gg/#home","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/vulcano-2/logo.png"}
