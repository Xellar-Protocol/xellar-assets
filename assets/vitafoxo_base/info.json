{"name":"VitaFOXO","id":"vitafoxo_base","symbol":"vitafoxo","description":"This project will design a new RNA therapeutic that nudges the longevity-linked FOXO3 gene into its health-promoting form to halt the tissue breakdown behind degenerative disc disease—opening a precise, scalable route to drugs that extend healthspan. Dr. Lorna Harries’ lab has identified an innovative way to modulate FOXO3, a well known and yet undrugged longevity target, and propose leveraging it to address chronic lower back pain stemming from degenerative disc disease. They plan to make short, lab-made modified RNA molecules (antisense oligonucleotides) that selectively switch FOXO3’s “good” message on, first in human cells and mini-disc models. Success would yield 1) a lead drug candidate, 2) proof it can restore disc health, and 3) the data needed for patenting and further development. The same molecules could later be adapted to treat many other age-related conditions, helping people stay healthy for longer.","links":"https://app.bio.xyz/ipts/foxo3","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/vitafoxo_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe8f802b0cb13adf1a4333b541d4d3f703b8a69fa","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xe8f802b0cb13adf1a4333b541d4d3f703b8a69fa"}},"is_native":false}
