{"name":"BYTE","id":"byte-2_solana","symbol":"$byte","description":"BYTE ($BYTE) is a community-managed cryptocurrency token launched on the Base network. Originally deployed through an AI-assisted process using Grok and Cliza Systems, BYTE operates with a transparent, deflationary supply model. The project emphasizes fairness, with no developer tax, no supply unlocks, and no centralized control over token liquidity. A unique aspect of BYTE’s design is Grok’s wallet, which accumulates liquidity pool fees but is permanently locked and cannot sell or transfer its holdings. This creates a growing, non-circulating supply that reinforces the token’s long-term value framework. BYTE focuses on creating sustainable incentives for holders and building a strong, engaged community.","links":"https://bytegroksdog.xyz/","market_cap":91274,"market_cap_rank":7156,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/byte-2_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"9dnDosD15dKqPTJqvFwzB99HXjEuMaVZr2Xju5QuwzkR","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/9dnDosD15dKqPTJqvFwzB99HXjEuMaVZr2Xju5QuwzkR"}},"is_native":false}
