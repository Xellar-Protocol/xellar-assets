Our insurance asset management platform and asset registry mobile app will connect to our Web 3 insurance DAO and take insurance to a new level of trustworthiness and transparency.

The Day By Day platform is supported and driven by the DBD Token which will be used for: - Decentralised insurance transactions (premium payments, claim payments) - Powering the Insurance DAO (governance) - Resolving premium accuracy - Income for investors via DAO staking and claims pool liquidity investing - Insurer and investor risk management - Rewards for the community","links":"https://daybyday.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/day-by-day/logo.png"}
