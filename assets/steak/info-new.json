{"name":"Steak","id":"steak","symbol":"steak","description":"In a world where only 100,000 portions of STEAK exist, a frenzy of accumulation ensues, fueling an unprecedented race for ownership. With scarcity driving its value, the quest to amass as much as possible intensifies, spurred by the promise of exclusive benefits awaiting those who secure a stake before the masses catch on. $STEAK emerges as a token of exclusivity, offering a spectrum of privileges including governance rights, access to platform features, VIP privileges, and opportunities for token buybacks. Its significance transcends mere ownership, serving as a pivotal instrument in shaping the future of PawFi, the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) it governs. Each $STEAK represents a vote, empowering users to influence critical decisions concerning the trajectory of PawFi and the fate of $STEAK itself. The utility of $STEAK extends beyond governance, as holders can leverage their assets through borrowing, lending, and staking mechanisms within the PawFi ecosystem. Borrowing $STEAK enables access to platform features, while lending it as collateral yields attractive annual percentage yields (APY). Furthermore, staking $STEAK offers a pathway to augmenting one's holdings, perpetuating the cycle of accumulation. The synergy between PAW and SHIB ecosystems amplifies the allure of $STEAK, offering a gateway for participants to engage in decentralized finance (DeFi) and earn STEAK through PawFi utilization. The narrative of $STEAK transcends mere scarcity-driven speculation, evolving into a narrative of empowerment, governance, and symbiotic growth within the PawFi ecosystem. As stakeholders vie for their slice of the finite $STEAK supply, they catalyze a paradigm shift in decentralized governance and ecosystem interconnectivity, heralding a new era of DeFi innovation and collaboration.","links":"https://www.pawzone.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/steak/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc4c244f1dbca07083fee35220d2169957c275e68"}}}
