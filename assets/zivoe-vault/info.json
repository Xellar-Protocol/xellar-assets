{"name":"Zivoe Vault","id":"zivoe-vault","symbol":"zvlt","description":"Zivoe is a Real World Asset (RWA) protocol tokenizing consumer credit. zVLT (Zivoe Vault) is Zivoe’s flagship tokenized product. It offers qualified purchasers exposure to a professionally managed portfolio of consumer loans. The loans backing zVLT typically range between $2,000 to $10,000 in notional size and are extended to borrowers across the North American region. zVLT is a yield-bearing token, meaning that it delivers returns through price appreciation. As borrowers make interest payments, the underlying loan portfolio grows in value—reflected by a steadily increasing token price. The strategy seeks net annual returns of 14–17% APY, and is run by a team that has decades of experience managing credit risk at leading financial institutions and DeFi protocols including JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Capital One, and Maple Finance.","links":"https://www.zivoe.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/zivoe-vault/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x94babe9ee75c38034920bc6ed42748e8eefbedd4","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x94babe9ee75c38034920bc6ed42748e8eefbedd4"}}}
