{"name":"Exactly USD Coin","id":"exactly-usd-coin_optimistic-ethereum","symbol":"exausdc","description":"Exactly Protocol is a decentralized, non-custodial and open-source protocol that provides an autonomous interest rate market to lenders and borrowers while setting interest rates based on credit supply and demand, enabling users to frictionlessly exchange the time value of their crypto assets at both variables and fixed interest rates for the first time in DeFi. Aside from taking loans and making deposits at variable interest rates from a Variable Rate Pool, this protocol enables users to do so at fixed rates through interaction with several Fixed Rate Pools, each representing a specific maturity date. Interest rates are determined based on the credit utilization rate of each Fixed Rate Pool.","links":"https://exact.ly/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/exactly-usd-coin_optimistic-ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"optimistic-ethereum":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0x6926b434cce9b5b7966ae1bfeef6d0a7dcf3a8bb","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/optimism/tokens/0x6926b434cce9b5b7966ae1bfeef6d0a7dcf3a8bb"}},"is_native":false}
