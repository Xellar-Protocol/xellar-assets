The closest product analogy from traditional finance is “fund of funds”. Each Vault LP token accumulates interest over time in stablecoins, currently yielding around 15%-30% APY for $YLA holders. The exact performance depends on performance of Yearn vaults and rebalancing strategy. $YLA is market-neutral product allowing to generate profits regardless market conditions and volatility. Note, that $YLA price can only grow.
