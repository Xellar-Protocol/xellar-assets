{"name":"花花 (flower flower)","id":"flower-flower_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"花花","description":"In the lush bamboo groves of Sichuan, a gentle legend was born, Hua Hua. With her soft, snow-white fur and upside-down teardrop eye patches, she is unlike any other panda. From humble beginnings, slower, smaller, and often outpaced by her peers. Hua Hua turned vulnerability into quiet strength. When others snatch her bamboo, she doesn’t fight; she simply smiles, reclaims her peace, and continues peeling stalks. As viral videos racked up billions of views, Hua Hua became more than a panda, she became a symbol of resilience, calm, and togetherness. Her devoted caretaker, “Grandpa Tan,” mirrors her temperament, forging a bond that moved hearts across China. Now, the crypto community launch this token in her honor. A celebration of her spirit, her gentle power, and the community she inspires. Let us unite under Hua Hua’s banner: slow is steady, kindness conquers, and together we reach for greatness. Welcome to Hua Hua Token where community, strength, and heart converge.","links":"https://huahuabnb.com/","market_cap":36921,"market_cap_rank":8677,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/flower-flower_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x3a87ac774d7db3e2d240aa2e9a029b7092054444","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x3a87ac774d7db3e2d240aa2e9a029b7092054444"}},"is_native":false}
