{"name":"Miracle Universe","id":"miracle-universe","symbol":"mu","description":"MU is committed to creating Web3 infrastructure to serve the game industry's transition to the next generation of the web. We aim to simplify the creation of new metaverses, games, and mixed reality experiences on Web3. With MU technology/financial/publishing platform, we will allow game developers to make this transition faster and cheaper. We believe a simple blockchain SDK is nowhere near what the average game developer needs. So instead, we support more functionality, including blockchain game features such as staking, leasing, grinding, a dashboard for operations, an in-game NFT marketplace, and an in-game wallet. Ultimately, we will provide multi-chain technical and financial services along with decentralized publishing. Our vision is to completely disrupt the centralized game publishing business model and enable the growth of interactive experiences only made possible by the foundation of Web3.","links":"https://www.miracles.games/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/miracle-universe/logo.png"}
