{"name":"MetaShells","id":"metashells","symbol":"shell","description":"Humankind's first currency; metaverse's last. MetaShells, the \"Book Value Token\", is an SPL token based on the Solana blockchain with a pre-mined supply of 1 million SHELL tokens. Its raison d'Ãªtre is to be the most liquid and universally adopted currency in the metaverse. To achieve this end, every operational aspect of the token has been designed for the singular purpose of facilitating the long-term growth of MetaShells' net asset value (NAV), including the automatic funneling of earned liquidity fees back into MetaShells' liquidity pools. Additionally, 30% of the total supply will be managed and invested by the MetaShells Foundation. Any and all profits generated by the Foundation will solely be used for the following purposes: 1) to drive MetaShells adoption; 2) to grow MetaShells' liquidity pools; and 3) to purchase SHELL tokens under MetaShells' \"Buy & Burn\" program. Reports on MetaShells' financials will be reported on a quarterly or more frequent basis for transparency. MetaShells' fixed limited supply and perpetual liquidity growth make MetaShells the ultimate store of value and utility token for the metaverse.","links":"https://metashells.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/metashells/logo.png"}
