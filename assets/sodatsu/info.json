{"name":"Sodatsu","id":"sodatsu","symbol":"sodatsu","description":"Sodatsu is the Reward Token paid out as Emissions for Staking and Farming in the SokuSwap Ecosystem. It acts as a reflection token, with a 10% tax that is split. The tax split goes as follows: 6% for Liquidity and 4% goes to Buy Back Soku, our native token. Out of that 4%, 3% goes into the Sodatsu staking pools and 1% goes towards marketing. Sodatsu works as a supporting partner to Soku, by being the Emission token for the Ecosystem with a Tax that Buys Back Soku. Due to the higher gas fees on Ethereum, the reflection and liquidity functions, are done manually by the company.","links":"https://sokuswap.com","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/sodatsu/logo.png"}
