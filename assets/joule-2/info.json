{"name":"Joule","id":"joule-2","symbol":"joule","description":"Kinetic is a lending protocol built on the Flare Network, harnessing the network's unique features in FTSO (Flare Time Series Oracle) and FAssets technology. With Flare's FTSO and FAssets, Kinetic offers users a unique opportunity to leverage the value of their non-native assets like BTC, DOGE, and XRP in a decentralized and secure manner. The FTSO ensures accurate and decentralized price feeds, while FAssets enable the representation of non-native tokens on the Flare Network, thus broadening the scope of assets available for lending and borrowing.","links":"https://kinetic.market","market_cap":7915124,"market_cap_rank":1973,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/joule-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"flare-network":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe6505f92583103af7ed9974dec451a7af4e3a3be"}}}
