{"name":"Brick Block","id":"brick-block","symbol":"brick","description":"Real estate investment powered by blockchain for fractionalownership and passive income. BrickBlock empowers the digitization of real estate value and revenue streams. By leveraging blockchain technology, we transform traditional property ownership into tradable tokens (NFTs) or fungible investment tokens. This unlocks new possibilities: fractional ownership allows investment in high-value properties with lower capital, while revenue streams like rent or resale profits can be automatically distributed to token holders, creating a transparent and efficient system for both investors and property owners.","links":"https://brickblock.estate/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/brick-block/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x00199c511dc889b8155fa425fc0363ed481e8f48","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x00199c511dc889b8155fa425fc0363ed481e8f48"}}}
