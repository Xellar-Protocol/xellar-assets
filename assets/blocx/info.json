{"name":"BlocX [OLD]","id":"blocx","symbol":"blx","description":"What is the project about? BlocX is a Layer 1 blockchain technology that focuses on Speed, Low gas fee and The secureness of the network. The technology has been designed to address the growing need for interoperability between different EVM blockchain networks, which is becoming increasingly important as the number of blockchain networks and applications continues to grow. This mechanism is designed to be highly scalable, allowing for large numbers of transactions to be processed quickly and efficiently. One of the key features of BlocX is its ability to seamlessly integrate with other EVM blockchain networks, allowing users to transfer assets and data between different blockchains with ease. This is achieved through the use of smart contracts, which allow for complex transactions to be executed automatically and transparently. Another important feature of BlocX is its focus on security. The technology uses advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure that transactions are secure and private, and that user data is protected at all times. This makes BlocX an ideal choice for applications that require high levels of security. What makes your project unique? BlocX is a Layer 1 blockchain that will stand out but stand together with EVM compatible networks. By prioritizing low gas costs and maintaining a secure network, BlocX opens up new possibilities for decentralized applications (dApps), developers, and users in the blockchain ecosystem. KEY FEATURES: Low Gas Costs for Enhanced Affordability Interoperability across EVM-Compatible Blockchains Secure Network for Trustworthy Transactions History of your project. BlocX was launched on the Binance Smart Chain network on the 12th Of April 2023 Vision. BlocX is a blockchain layer 1 network built on the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Our vision for BlocX is to create a high-performance blockchain infrastructure that is both fast and efficient, while also being highly secure and decentralized. At BlocX, we understand that speed and efficiency are critical factors in the success of any blockchain network. That's why we are committed to building a platform that can process transactions quickly, with low gas fees, and without sacrificing security or decentralization. To achieve this vision, BlocX is leveraging the latest advancements in blockchain technology, including advanced consensus algorithms, sharding, and optimized smart contract execution. By combining these innovations, we are able to offer a platform that can handle a high volume of transactions per second, while keeping gas fees low and minimizing network congestion. In addition, BlocX is focused on providing a highly secure and decentralized network. Our PoS consensus mechanism ensures that the network is secured by a diverse set of validators, without relying on energy-intensive mining. We also offer robust security features, including advanced encryption and decentralized key management, to protect user data and assets. We believe that by providing a platform that is accessible, affordable, and easy to use, we can help drive the adoption and growth of blockchain technology, and unlock its full potential for the benefit of society.","links":"https://www.blocxchain.org/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/blocx/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x2f5fb3d3ab21bde07c5aa389e92366651b406c30"}}}
