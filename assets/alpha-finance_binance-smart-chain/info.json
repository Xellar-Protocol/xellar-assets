{"name":"Stella","id":"alpha-finance_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"alpha","description":"What is Stella (Previously Alpha Finance Lab) (ALPHA)? Stella is the leveraged strategies protocol with 0% cost to borrow. Stella’s mission is to redefine how leveraged DeFi works. DeFi needs a good leverage system in order to drive more usages on DEXes and money markets, the fundamental building blocks of DeFi. With growing usages on these fundamentals, more protocols and new innovations can arise and tap into the deep liquidity and robust foundation. Stella strives to become the go-to destination for DeFi users to access maximum yield potential. Whatever on-chain strategies that users want to use on leverage (and safe enough to be supported), then Stella will support at 0% cost to borrow. The protocol is made up of two parts: Stella Strategy and Stella Lend. Stella Strategy: Users can access multiple selections of leveraged strategies with 0% borrowing interest for the first time and get yields on leverage. Stella Lend: Lenders can lend assets to the lending pools on Stella and get real yields. Yields generated from Stella Strategy are shared to lenders.","links":"https://stellaxyz.io/","market_cap":4933873,"market_cap_rank":2083,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/alpha-finance_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa1faa113cbe53436df28ff0aee54275c13b40975","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xa1faa113cbe53436df28ff0aee54275c13b40975"}},"is_native":false}
