{"name":"AUREO","id":"aureo","symbol":"aur","description":"Age Of Cryptology (AOC) is a Play & Earn ecosystem deployed on the Binance Smart Chain which combines thrilling and entertaining lore with the possibilities that blockchain technology offers. In AOC every asset is an NFT (Non-fungible token) which allows you to be the sole owner of that asset and to have full control over it. The in-game economy also includes a utility token called “Aureo” (A former roman currency) that will work as the main game currency. Aureo has a real-world value as it can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies or even for real money (fiat currency like USD or EUR). This is the awesome new concept of Play & Earn games! Our vision is to develop this concept of Play & Earn into a more mature one in which strategy and skill are also important. We don’t want to be a “sit and click here” game. In the pursuit of this new concept of “Master & Earn” we want to be completely transparent with our in-game algorithms and probabilities for you to be able to analyze it and create your custom strategy.","links":"https://www.ageofcryptology.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/aureo/logo.png"}
