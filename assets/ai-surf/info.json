{"name":"AI Surf","id":"ai-surf","symbol":"aisc","description":"AISC is a system based on machine learning algorithms, which can transform complex algorithms into simple and understandable symbolic expressions, such as charts, flow charts, mathematical formulas, etc. This way, developers can intuitively see the logic and effect of the algorithm without having to write lengthy code. This greatly shortens the development cycle and improves the development efficiency.","links":"https://aiscoin.ai/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ai-surf/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
