{"name":"Bully Inu","id":"bully-inu","symbol":"binu","description":"BULLY INU ($BINU) is an ERC token, running on Ethereum’s Blockchain, that places strong emphasize on high deflation techniques. The token has been created for crypto investors of all ages and experience levels. The tokenomics of $BINU have been designed to maintain positive trending, known as BULLISH trending, promoting peace of mind and steady long term growth for both seasoned investors, as well as new or novice investors looking to dive deeper into the crypto world with a project and development team they can count on. This BULLISH trending and steady growth is achieved through the high deflation techniques of $BINU with a tactic we call GRAZING. A high portion of the coin’s utility/tax goes into project marketing. With ample funds for marketing, the team is able to do much more beyond advertising and promoting the project; As new holders FEED and loyal holders REFEED our hungry Bull, the team is also able to help keep our Bull consistently fed through GRAZING. The combined efforts of FEEDING, REFEEDING, and GRAZING is why $BINU will not only yield, but also maintain a BULLISH trend. Beyond the tactics of coin utility and tax, $BINU has discovered the “Goldilocks Zone” for how much is to be taxed; token taxes are low enough to promote new investors as well as holder reinvestment, yet high enough to prohibit 2-3x market manipulators known in the crypto world as “Jeets.” This helps the token’s trend to remain BULLISH and reach new ATH’s (All Time Highs) rather than fall into a range of manipulation.","links":"https://www.bullyinu.info/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bully-inu/logo.png"}
