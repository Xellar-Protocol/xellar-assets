Inspired by Stan Lee’s own hilarious cartoon series on YouTube called Bad Days which can be found on the channel Marvelous TV: https://www.youtube.com/c/MarvelousTV/videos, Bad Days allows players to Collect, Fuse, Battle, and Trade token-based Superheroes. The Bad Days Alpha release includes 12 superheroes, and new characters are available each season. Bad Days Characters come in 5 different rarity scales: common, uncommon, rare, legendary, and Mythic - and 5 attribute Levels measured by and known as the power grid, Each Bad Days Character is a custom ERC-1155 non-fungible token (NFT) with different attributes and strengths and can be entered into PVP, PVE, and 3v3 battles, with each win earning Battle Points (BP), MNFT Shards, and game Items that are used to Unlock superpowers and build player attributes. These characters can be fused together to produce unique player-built battle decks, which can be used in the battle arenas. The Bad Days ecosystem also has its own unique process, known as Fusion. There are two types of Fusion. First is the process of transferring superpowers from one character to another, permanently locking to the character creating a customised and unique NFT character asset. Second is the process of leveling up rarity and power grid attributes. The second process requires a Bad Days Character (BDC) to be burnt, thus reducing the (BDC) supply.
