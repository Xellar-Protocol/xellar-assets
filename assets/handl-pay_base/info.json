{"name":"Handl Pay","id":"handl-pay_base","symbol":"handl","description":"About Handl Pay: Handl is a peer-to-peer payments platform that turns social media usernames into cross-chain payment handles. We allow anyone to send and receive crypto and fiat without needing banking details, wallet addresses, bridges, or app downloads. Handl is built to support card payments, stablecoins, crypto assets, and local payment methods, routing all funds to a user-selected wallet or account. Mission: Handl aims to remove the complexity of global and cross-currency payments and by enabling frictionless peer-to-peer and business-to-consumer transactions using familiar social identities. Problem Statement: P2P payments today are still far too complicated. Sending crypto often takes 10–20 minutes, requiring multiple steps such as... Collecting and verifying the recipient's wallet details, choosing a chain, figuring out routing, possibly bridging or using a third-party remittance service... HANDL eliminates all of this. Sending money becomes as easy as sending a message.
