{"name":"Digitex","id":"digitex-futures-exchange","symbol":"dgtx","description":"Digitex.io is a commission-free cryptocurrency futures and Spot Market exchange with a rapid-fire one-click trading ladder and high leverage. Traders can buy and sell perpetual swap futures contracts on Bitcoin or Ethereum against the US Dollar and pay no transaction fees on any trades. As well as traders will not pay any taker or maker fees on Spot Market. Commission-free trading is made possible by using its own cryptocurrency, called the DGTX token, as the native currency of the futures exchange. Instead of covering costs by charging transaction fees on trades, Digitex meets the operational costs of running the futures exchange by creating and selling a small number of new DGTX tokens each year.","links":"https://digitex.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/digitex-futures-exchange/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc666081073e8dff8d3d1c2292a29ae1a2153ec09"}}}
