{"name":"Wrapped Statera","id":"wrapped-statera","symbol":"wsta","description":"$WSTA is a wrapped version of $STA token, currently at 1:1. It works similar to WETH with the unique feature of \"\"safe deflation\"\", as opposed to $STA which can be taken advantage of as a result of the deflationary feature. $WSTA can safely enable burning of $STA, and can be safely used on other DEX aggregators such as Balancer, 1inch, Matcha, etc.","links":"https://stateratoken.com","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wrapped-statera/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xedeec5691f23e4914cf0183a4196bbeb30d027a0"},"fantom":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xceebde49ec95e21f7ee63c5c6f98cab3519570de"},"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf629712180bef6f4c569b704e03d0acbe276eb6d"}}}
