{"name":"Wrapped Statera","id":"wrapped-statera","symbol":"wsta","description":"$WSTA is a wrapped version of $STA token, currently at 1:1. It works similar to WETH with the unique feature of \"\"safe deflation\"\", as opposed to $STA which can be taken advantage of as a result of the deflationary feature. $WSTA can safely enable burning of $STA, and can be safely used on other DEX aggregators such as Balancer, 1inch, Matcha, etc.","links":"https://stateratoken.com","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wrapped-statera/logo.png"}
