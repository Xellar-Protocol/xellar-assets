{"name":"MyStandard","id":"mystandard","symbol":"myst","description":"We are a Zero Knowledge proof hiring data market where we use incentives to drive actions. People can download the app off the iOS or Android app store (USA only for launch) and register with us. After that, they'll receive data requests for their data from employers. Employers are also given incentives to validate data on candidates--those incentives turn into free candidate data requests. This is a mass adoption play, which is why Avalanche is so invested in us.","links":"https://mystandard.io","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mystandard/logo.png","detail_platform":{"avalanche":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0256b279d973c8d687264ac3eb36be09232d4474"}}}
