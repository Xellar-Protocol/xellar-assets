{"name":"Alcatraz","id":"alcatraz","symbol":"alcz","description":"What is the project about? We aim to be pioneers in offering secure liquidity locking for Layer 2 networks and Ethereum, with low fees and high security, all while embracing a core concept of revenue sharing that benefits both project creators and token holders. What makes your project unique? Our project stands out for several reasons. Firstly, we offer liquidity locking with a unique revenue-sharing mechanism for token holders, simultaneously reducing locking fees for project owners to a minimum. Secondly, our primary focus is on Layer 2 networks, and we are committed to extending our liquidity-locking services to emerging networks as soon as they become operational. History of your project. Our journey began with a common pain point in the crypto space – the high cost of liquidity-locking for project owners. To address this issue, we decided to create a project that not only provides a cost-effective solution but also builds synergies with token holders. What’s next for your project? Our immediate goal is the launch of a platform that offers liquidity-locking services on Ethereum and any upcoming Layer 2 networks in the near future. We are committed to expanding our reach and ensuring accessibility for a broader range of projects and networks. What can your token be used for? Our token serves a dual purpose: revenue sharing and governance. Token holders can benefit from the revenue generated by the project, and they also have a say in the decision-making process through governance mechanisms.","links":"https://alcatraz.tech/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/alcatraz/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xfed656555a88c86675d2bf01a3b7861c3f89d478"}}}
