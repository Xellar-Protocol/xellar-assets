{"name":"Oliver's Cat","id":"oliver-s-cat","symbol":"phoenix","description":"$PHOENIX was born from the ashes of a man who quit his corporate job, emptied his 401K retirement account, took his cat Phoenix, and set sail for a freer life around the world. He streams his adventures on Instragram and Tiktok with millions of followers and views. His mindshare is growing exponentially. No roadmap. No VCs. Just wind, willpower, and a Starlink. It’s the kind of story that speaks to everything crypto stands for: rebellion, self-sovereignty, and choosing purpose over permission. The community saw something powerful in this moment and wanted to amplify it. The world needs to see that the community can support people and missions worth literally dying for.

It represents rising from the ashes of soul crushing corporate life before it’s too late.
