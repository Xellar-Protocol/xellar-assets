{"name":"HealthFi App","id":"healthfi-app","symbol":"hefi","description":"HealthFi is a Web3 fitness application built with Tracking-Fi and Game-Fi elements. The idea behind HealthFi is simple enough: it is built for most people to start living their healthy lives by simple action: workout. We are the first project to bring all sport models into an application and blockchain integration concept. At HealthFi, users will use sport NFT such as Skipping Ropes, Sneakers, Bicycle,... Then jumping, running, riding,.. to earn reward. We believe that having a unique experience & interesting exercise is one of the ways the app can be appealing and engaging, but also rewarding to the players.","links":"https://healthfi.app/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/healthfi-app/logo.png"}
