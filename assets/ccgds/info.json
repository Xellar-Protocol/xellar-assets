The value of CCGDS will continue to rise in the future as the volume of DAO members gradually increases and the amount invested increases Through a series of token mechanisms such as CCGDS deflation and dividends to attract members to contribute，the purpose of CCGDS investment decisions are virtuously driven. The CCGDS is initiated by the CCGDS DAO community and is decentralised，making the holder of the token the “owner” of the platform。The more active users are，the more value they contribute and the more active the ecosystem becomes，which is empowering for both the platform and its members.","links":"https://www.ccgds.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ccgds/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x1baadfd674c641149b0d5a39e697ec877ab47083"}}}
