{"name":"Plug Chain","id":"plug-chain","symbol":"pc","description":"The Plug Chain network, which was launched by Chinese developers in August 2021, is an extensible intelligent contract platform that enables NFT development on the main network, and DEX construction on the secondary network. It is planned that the team will complete one-click token generation, as well as create standard contracts, with a touch of the button. Future development efforts will focus on the Oracle network protocol. The Oracle protocol is expected to host large amounts of data in 2023, allowing blockchain data to be seamlessly integrated with real-world information, allowing developers to easily build decentralized applications on the Plug chain with higher efficiency and lesser effort.","links":"https://plugchain.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/plug-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
