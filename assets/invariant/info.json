{"name":"Invariant","id":"invariant","symbol":"invt","description":"Invariant is a multichain, fully permissionless AMM DEX featuring a concentrated liquidity mechanism. The functionality of the exchange allows retail users to easily swap tokens and efficiently provide their liquidity. The DEX is focused on capital efficiency, the easy addition of new markets by project creators, and a smooth user interface. Our goal is to become the leading DEX on the multiple blockchain, which is why we are open to all forms of cooperation. We originated from Solana and have been live on the Solana mainnet since March 2022. The idea was rewarded at the Solana Riptide Hackathon. Since its launch, Invariant has never experienced any major outages, and its daily average volume is around $5M.","links":"https://invariant.app/swap","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/invariant/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""},"solana":{"decimal_place":4,"contract_address":"invTrkA5SbM49yjk9EoknQ8DpBhaprTJ5csdkzTnAiV","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/invTrkA5SbM49yjk9EoknQ8DpBhaprTJ5csdkzTnAiV"}}}
