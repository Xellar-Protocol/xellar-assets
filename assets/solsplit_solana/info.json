{"name":"SolSplit","id":"solsplit_solana","symbol":"spl","description":"SolSplit is a Solana-native app for on-chain bill splitting. Users create groups, add expenses, track net balances, and settle with one click using Solana wallets. The app focuses on transparent flows (who paid, who owes) and eliminates off-chain IOUs. Infrastructure pieces include wallet authentication and programmatic payments so settlements are fast, verifiable, and auditable on-chain and also we will work on roadmap.","links":"https://www.sol-split.io","market_cap":5033.5,"market_cap_rank":12357,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/solsplit/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"EYw27YGciv1KYbt7nSpJJZMYmg2v7vgkWpZbC4Pbpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/EYw27YGciv1KYbt7nSpJJZMYmg2v7vgkWpZbC4Pbpump"}},"is_native":false}
