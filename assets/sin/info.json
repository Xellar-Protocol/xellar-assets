{"name":"sinDAO","id":"sin","symbol":"sin","description":"sinDAO is pioneering the NFTxTOKEN movement. SIN is at the core of the sinDAO economy. Users are able to use SIN to mint new, unique Sinner NFTs permissionlessly, or burn Sinner NFTs to retrieve that SIN back. Every time a Sinner NFT is burned, 66,666,666 SIN is burnt forever. This demonstrates how deflation works in our system. The max supply of SIN is 6,666,666,666,666. NFT mints arenâ€™t hard-capped but are limited by the SIN supply. Each mint births a new, unique Sinner NFT and provides access to the DAO. The whole project is curated by the DAO.","links":"https://sindao.org","market_cap":589077,"market_cap_rank":2939,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/sin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"sin1uRe1cMCWR7VPLdZrGrvKs8UvKMsGzhvpJLg4Ld9"}}}
