{"name":"DEF1","id":"def1_ethereum","symbol":"def1","description":"$DEF1 is the first token launched on XPAD, a decentralized Ethereum launchpad powered by bonding curves. Originally created as a test token to validate XPAD’s mechanism, DEF1 gained unexpected community traction. It has no pre-sale, no team allocation, and operates with zero mint functions. All tokens are distributed via bonding, ensuring fair access. XPAD redistributes generated fees to its ecosystem, supporting $XERS (staking rewards) and $KOKO (burns). The project promotes transparency, decentralization, and utility-based sustainability within DeFi.","links":"https://x.com/i/communities/1963546131792527662","market_cap":6906.99,"market_cap_rank":11863,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/def1/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x71a44d1f075c41903cc73840f387909bb226def1","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x71a44d1f075c41903cc73840f387909bb226def1"}},"is_native":false}
