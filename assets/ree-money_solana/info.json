{"name":"REE Money","id":"ree-money_solana","symbol":"ree","description":"Introduction REE Money is a mining-based crypto game built on the Solana blockchain and themed around Rare Earth Elements (REE). The protocol introduces a transparent, round-based mining system where players deposit SOL into a 4×4 grid of rare earth elements, and a single winning element is selected each round using secure on-chain randomness. $REE tokens are minted and awarded to miners on the winning element, while simultaneously 90% of all SOL deposited that round is redistributed back to those same winning miners in proportion to their deposit. A \"refining fee\" of 10% is applied to all REE mining rewards when claimed. The proceeds from this fee are automatically redistributed to other miners in proportion to their unclaimed REE mining rewards. Thus, the longer a miner holds onto their mined REE, the more refined REE they will receive. The net effect of this process is to redistribute tokens to longer–term holders. Design Goals REE Money is designed with the following goals: • Fair and transparent mining: All minting is controlled by smart contracts on Solana with verifiable on-chain randomness. • Simple, capped tokenomics: Fixed maximum supply with clear, predictable emission channels. • Incentives for both miners and holders: Active miners earn $REE and a share of 90% of all SOL deposited in each round, while passive holders benefit from a recurring Jackpot and long-term buyback-and-burn funded by the treasury.","links":"https://ree.money/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ree-money/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":11,"contract_address":"uKV2rALePzYtrTayv7nDNEfw3SxAa2boDPcJzwo6REE","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/uKV2rALePzYtrTayv7nDNEfw3SxAa2boDPcJzwo6REE"}},"is_native":false}
