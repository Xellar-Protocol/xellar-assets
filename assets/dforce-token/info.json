{"name":"dForce","id":"dforce-token","symbol":"df","description":"dForce is advocating for building a full suite of DeFi protocols covering assets, lending, trading, staking, and bridge, serving as DeFi infrastructure in Web3. dForce DAO is a community-driven project, with major protocol changes driven by the community and jointly decided by DF token holders through governance. Stablecoin USX USX is the most important DeFi primitive within dForceâ€™s protocol matrix. As a decentralized and algorithmic stablecoin, USX implements a dual model (pool-based & vault-based) with hybrid interest rate policy, making it highly efficient and flexible to support collaterals of different risk profiles in isolation. USX is powered by protocol-controlled liquidity to facilitate protocol-to-protocol integrations, as well as cross-chain bridge that allow users to move USX across supported blockchains with zero slippage and uncapped limit. dForce Lending dForce Lending is a pool-based multi-sided lending protocol which supports multiple collaterals with a market-driven dynamic interest rate model. dForce Lending has undergone extensive code reviews and security audits by Trail of Bits, ConsenSys Diligence, CertiK, Certora (formal verification), with a bug bounty launched through Immunefi. dForce Lending has been deployed for over 1 year and is well battle-tested. dForce Staking dForce introduces a hybrid model featuring both Free Staking and Lock-up Staking. Staking unlocks a new approach for DF token holders to capture fee income across dForce network. Participants in Free Staking can unstake at any time, whilst those committed to Lock-up Staking will earn higher yield and voting power. In addition, most of DF purchased in the secondary market will be rewarded to participants in Lock-up Staking. dForce Trading Peer-to-peer marketplace with aggregated liquidity across different platforms with the best price. dForce Bridge A cross-chain bridging tool facilitating instant and low-cost transfer of USX and DF across all supported L2s and blockchains.","links":"https://dforce.network/","market_cap":16528533,"market_cap_rank":963,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dforce-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x431ad2ff6a9c365805ebad47ee021148d6f7dbe0"},"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xae6aab43c4f3e0cea4ab83752c278f8debaba689"},"energi":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc588d81d1a9ef1a119446482fc7cbcdb0012292a"},"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x4a9a2b2b04549c3927dd2c9668a5ef3fca473623"}}}
