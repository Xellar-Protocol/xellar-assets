The film financing app (\"DCP App\") allows participants to submit film proposals (“Film Proposals”), review and rate such Film Proposals, and make use of the accompanying web-based application that will allow users (“Users”) to vie for financing and production support for their projects. DCP encourages other individuals and entities to build arts and culture related applications on top of the T4L3NT Net to be a part of the ecosystem of applications in the Virtual Studio.","links":"https://decentralized.pictures/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/filmcredits/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
