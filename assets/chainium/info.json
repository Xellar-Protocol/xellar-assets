{"name":"WeOwn","id":"chainium","symbol":"chx","description":"Welcome to WeOwn! It’s big, bold and ambitious. It’s sets out our clear goal for global market growth. WeOwn works for businesses — businesses is about ownership and they need to take ownership of their investors and investor engagement WeOwn works for investors — investors own their shares and, by buying shares, they own a part of the business they have invested in WeOwn works for developers — developers own the solutions they will build on our blockchain WeOwn enables us to be playful in our marketing communications. Check out our new website domain or consider campaigns with messages like ‘Own shares in businesses you really believe in’ or ‘We own shares’. Instead of buying/selling/trading shares, why not ‘Own it’. We’re going to have a lot of fun with this! we feel that Chainium is too limiting a name for our business. It’s too blockchain-centric. It’s too same-same. It’s too small a name for our global ambitions. As a result of our rebranding will change as of 2pm UTC Wednesday the 25th of July.","links":"https://weown.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/chainium/logo.png"}
