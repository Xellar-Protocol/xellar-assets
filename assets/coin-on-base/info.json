{"name":"Coin on Base","id":"coin-on-base","symbol":"coin","description":"$COIN is the meme that doesn't want to be one. Born without a roadmap, no team, no plan, $COIN isn’t here to convince you. There are no influencers, no Discord mods, no marketing budgets—just a name that hits too close to home and a launch that feels too aligned to be an accident. It pays homage to Coinbase, the on-ramp for millions into crypto, while existing completely outside the system it nods to. There’s no promise here—only presence. $COIN exists because it had to. Because a token called $COIN, on Base, with no devs and no agenda, is too perfect to ignore. It spreads not through hype but through curiosity, conviction, and a growing sense that maybe, just maybe, this isn’t random. No team. No plan. No lies. Just $COIN.","links":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/pools/0x5122e02898ece3bc62df8c1efdb29a9e914244d3","market_cap":255945,"market_cap_rank":6072,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/coin-on-base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8e16d46cb2da01cdd49601ec73d7b0344969ae33","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x8e16d46cb2da01cdd49601ec73d7b0344969ae33"}}}
