{"name":"Vite","id":"vite","symbol":"vite","description":"Vite has built the world’s first DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) based smart-contract platform, with a Snapshot Chain structure to facilitate zero-fee transactions and optimize transaction speed, reliability, and security. The Snapshot Chain of Vite utilizes Hierarchical Delegated Proof of Stake (“HDPoS”) to achieve network consensus. Vite’s current products include a truly trustless DEX (ViteX), a wallet-centric super-app (Vite App) and a Vite-based payment rail (VitePay). Vite’s next ambition is ViteBridge, a universal cross-chain solution that allows easy asset transfer between any two chains in a decentralized manner.","links":"https://www.vite.org/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/vite/logo.png"}
