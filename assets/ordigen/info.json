{"name":"OrdiGen","id":"ordigen","symbol":"odgn","description":"The digital asset landscape is constantly evolving, with Bitcoin, the bedrock of cryptocurrency, pioneering the way. Yet, its ecosystem hasn't always fully embraced the growing trend of tokenization. Enter BRC-20, a revolutionary protocol enabling the creation of fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. This opens doors to exciting possibilities like DeFi applications, asset-backed tokens, and novel financial instruments. But unlocking the true potential of BRC-20 presents a significant challenge: fragmented liquidity and a complex user experience. Ordigen emerges as a beacon of light in this fragmented landscape. We are not simply another DEX; we are a revolutionary cross-chain aggregator, designed to tear down the walls between ETH and EVM tokens and the burgeoning BRC-20 ecosystem. Imagine a portal where you can invest in BRC-20 tokens with ease, simplicity, and optimal price execution, all without the need to bridge assets yourself or navigate the intricacies of multiple DEXs.","links":"https://www.ordigen.tech/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ordigen/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc3cc3076cb304494775b3193ef1aa080ba6bf962"}}}
