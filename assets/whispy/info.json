This token embodies the essence of those who have faced financial losses (\"rekt\") on the Solana blockchain. $WHISPY is conceptualized as a spirit that has amassed all the pain from these losses and manifests once every ten years to distribute profits back to the affected individuals. It is portrayed as a harbinger of significant profits, symbolizing a chance for redemption and profit return for those who have previously suffered financial setbacks in the crypto market. This creates a narrative that ties the token's value and significance to the recovery and eventual profit of its holders.","links":"https://whispyboo.com/","market_cap":41204,"market_cap_rank":5359,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/whispy/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"EEBA6E69rhvGgLSs633u5qVeNjo77fp2wY3yj8Aipump"}}}
