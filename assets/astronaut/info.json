{"name":"Astronaut","id":"astronaut","symbol":"naut","description":"Astronaut is a protocol built for decentralizing the way which new projects and ideas coming to the BNB ecosystem raise capital. The platform allows cryptocurrency projects to raise funds by setting up a pool based on a fixed purchase rate for tokens. These so called “Pools” have a soft cap and a hard cap. NAUT native token holders can stake BUSD according to their pool \"weight\" and receive a guranteed allocation of the IDO.","links":"https://astronaut.to/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/astronaut/logo.png"}
