{"name":"Gemholic","id":"gemholic","symbol":"gems","description":"What is the project about? Gemholic Ecosystem consists of product features and mechanisms that support each other while creating new benefits for all parties involved in the ecosystem. Gemholic Ecosystem provides GemLaunchpad, GemStaking, Gem Yield Farming, Gem Mining (Play-to-Earn feature), and Gem Cash (Tonardo Cash) for the entire CoreDAO Chain. What makes your project unique? The Gemholic Ecosystem uses 8-bit images as its main visual theme. With such a theme and visuals, we will attract many users as well as investors, as it is quite similar to old-school games with 8-bit graphics that make us feel like we're going back to our youth. It will feel like embarking on an adventure to search for treasure and mine resources. History of your project. We have been developing this project for over a month during the image-building phase, and now we are starting to promote the project within the CoreDAO ecosystem. What’s next for your project? In the near future, we will launch an IDO (Initial DEX Offering) on one of the reputable DEX platforms within the CoreDAO Chain. We are still in talks to reach agreements with them. What can your token be used for? The token of the Gemholic Ecosystem will be used for participating in play-to-earn features, staking, joining IDOs of other projects on GemLaunchPad, and so on.","links":"https://gemholic.world/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gemholic/logo.png","detail_platform":{"core":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xe0d829e913618a7d2e2ba27a5fc8c274a8c525cf","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/core/tokens/0xe0d829e913618a7d2e2ba27a5fc8c274a8c525cf"}}}
