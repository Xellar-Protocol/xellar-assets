{"name":"Paywong","id":"paywong","symbol":"pwg","description":"What is the project about? Paywong​ is pioneering a new standard for crypto payments to address the limitations of the existing landscape, providing a secure and direct payment infrastructure, enabling any website or app to receive payments into their wallets directly, keeping true to the possibilities of crypto. What makes your project unique? Customers can pay with any token they already own while merchants receive a settlement currency of their choice. The protocol utilises 'liquid assets' already present in a user's wallet and automatically swaps available tokens through decentralised exchanges and then routes the payments to merchants' wallets through the use of smart contracts in the most cost efficient way. History of your project. The project was founded in 2022 by Singapore based Web3 solutions company Walawong Solutions Private Limited. It has more than 4000 merchants globally accepting crypto payments through its product offering. What’s next for your project? Paywong is building a suite of crypto payments products catered to merchants and creators. Product includes payment links, invoicing, subscription payments and e-commerce checkouts. What can your token be used for? For Merchants The $PWG token is needed by merchants to access premium features on the platform through staking. A fixed number of $PWG is needed to unlock Paywong Pro features such as 0% transaction fees, sales analytics and more. For Customers Users earn tokens by transacting with Paywong merchants, similar to a cashback program offered by credit card companies. This provides an incentive for users to pay with crypto and helps to increase the platform's adoption.","links":"https://www.paywong.com","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/paywong/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":16,"contract_address":"0x383e64ac8808dce10a39f0dda8a0484f44e68f5a"}}}
