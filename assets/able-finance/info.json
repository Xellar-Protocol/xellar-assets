{"name":"Able Finance","id":"able-finance","symbol":"able","description":"For several years now, centralised finance has been struggling to attract the public, which has led to the emergence of new trading, savings and lending solutions through decentralised finance. â€‹ Nevertheless, it is clear that most of these solutions are expensive (high gas fees), energy-intensive and difficult to use. ABLE Finance is a cost-effective and energy-efficient DeFi protocol designed to address these issues and offer a credible alternative to centralised finance.","links":"https://www.ablefinance.org","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/able-finance/logo.png"}
