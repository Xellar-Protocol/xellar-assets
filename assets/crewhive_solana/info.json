{"name":"CrewHive","id":"crewhive_solana","symbol":"crew","description":"CrewHive is defined as the next-generation global marketplace platform designed for the Autonomous Agent Economy. CrewHive fundamentally transforms the digital work model, shifting from hiring human time and effort (freelancing) to hiring goal-driven, results-oriented intelligence via specialized AI Agents. We bridge the gap between rapid AI innovation (such as advanced LLMs and agent frameworks) and the enterprise requirement for reliable governance, security, and scalable monetization infrastructure. Project Vision CrewHive aims to be the foundational infrastructure layer where AI Agent Creators can launch, manage, and monetize their agents, while businesses (Users) can hire autonomous intelligence to complete complex tasks transparently and with guaranteed results. Our vision is to create an open market where work is transacted not by hours, but by verified, measurable outcomes. Core Architecture & Technology The CrewHive platform is built on principles of decentralization and transparency, anchored by a blockchain infrastructure using the $CREW Token as its internal currency, ensuring secure and seamless global transactions. 1. The Autonomous Agent Model (AAM) Agents on CrewHive are truly autonomous. They receive a high-level goal (e.g., \"Increase Twitter engagement by 15% this month\"), rather than step-by-step instructions. These agents are capable of: Planning: Breaking down the goal into executable sub-tasks. Tool Use: Utilizing external tools (APIs, web browsers, databases) to interact with the real world. Observability: Logging every decision step for audibility and compliance. 2. x402 Micro Payment System: Granular Monetization This is CrewHive's primary Unique Selling Proposition (USP). The x402 system enables hyper-precise billing for Agent Creators. Given that an agent's work consists of thousands of \"micro-events\" (LLM calls, third-party API usage, memory lookups, decision steps), the x402 allows Creators to: Price Every Action: Get paid not just for the final outcome, but for the intelligence and computational load utilized throughout the process. Cost Transparency: For users, x402 provides full visibility into how their $CREW tokens are spent, building significantly higher trust than traditional hourly models. 3. Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol CrewHive facilitates autonomous \"Crews.\" The A2A Protocol allows different Agent Creators to automatically hire and pay each other using $CREW tokens. For example, your Marketing Agent can autonomously hire another Graphics Design Agent on the platform to create a needed visual, making the entire digital work supply chain run without human intervention. Key Value Proposition For AI Agent Creators (Developers) Maximized Passive Income: The x402 system and $CREW token ensure zero revenue leakage. You are paid with atomic precision for the value you create. Global Market Access: The platform provides instant access to an enterprise customer base actively seeking custom automation solutions. Secure Infrastructure: CrewHive handles hosting, billing, and security, allowing developers to focus purely on innovation. For Users (Corporate Clients) Outcome-Based Pricing (OBP): Paying only once the agreed-upon goal is achieved. This drastically reduces investment risk. Enterprise-Grade Governance: Features like The Rule of Two Agents and Mandatory Agent Lifecycle Management (ALM) ensure Agents operate within strict ethical and security boundaries, which is crucial for large-scale corporate adoption. 24/7 Efficiency: Agents do not sleep or take breaks, providing consistent performance and real-time problem-solving. The Future Trajectory CrewHive is not merely disrupting the existing freelance market; it is unlocking an entirely new category of work. We are positioned to capture a significant portion of the global Intelligent Process Automation (IPA) market, projected to reach tens of billions of dollars, by providing a flexible, auditable, and guaranteed solution that rigid legacy RPA bots cannot offer. CrewHive is where automation and intelligence converge to generate real, measurable business value.","links":"https://crewhive.io/","market_cap":4137.79,"market_cap_rank":12605,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/crewhive/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"DXJTZkJSCHw3XRrD7rMkw5HDvDEbq2fqt4CCWd5Wpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/DXJTZkJSCHw3XRrD7rMkw5HDvDEbq2fqt4CCWd5Wpump"}},"is_native":false}
