{"name":"Vantum","id":"vantum","symbol":"vantum","description":"Vantum is a decentralized privacy protocol built on the Solana blockchain. It enables users to perform stealth transactions, private swaps, and AI-audited interactions without ever requiring KYC or leaving a public footprint. The core philosophy behind Vantum is simple: Privacy should be the default, not an afterthought. The $VANTUM token is designed to align incentives across the ecosystem while maintaining a sustainable economic model. With a fixed supply and community-first approach, $VANTUM serves as both a utility token and a governance mechanism for the Vantum privacy protocol.","links":"https://vantum.app/","market_cap":10822.41,"market_cap_rank":10794,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/vantum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"Hfm5LMEHXAGYuq2ofT1opYuDeE6Eg4wyTydL5wZfpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/Hfm5LMEHXAGYuq2ofT1opYuDeE6Eg4wyTydL5wZfpump"}}}
