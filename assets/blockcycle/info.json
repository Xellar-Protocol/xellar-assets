{"name":"BlockCycle","id":"blockcycle","symbol":"bloc","description":"BlockCycle ($BLOC) is a Solana-based token designed to incentivize trading activity through an hourly lottery draw system. Every hour, the protocol tracks trades of $BLOC and identifies eligible wallets holding at least $100 worth of $BLOC during that hour. Five random winners are selected to share the reward pool, which consists of SOL tokens. The project leverages blockchain technology for transparent winner selection and reward distribution, aiming to gamify trading activity on Solana.","links":"https://blockcycle.fun/","market_cap":13366.4,"market_cap_rank":9258,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/blockcycle/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"bLoCKG5okCUQuh6r6GFRvVRnBFRCXeZw2G29qxGYMot","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/bLoCKG5okCUQuh6r6GFRvVRnBFRCXeZw2G29qxGYMot"}}}
