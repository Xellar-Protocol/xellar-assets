{"name":"WibWob","id":"wibwob","symbol":"wibwob","description":"WibWob explores the near future of human-AI collaboration via a deliberately wonky and lo-fi world. This world is visualised by an ever-expanding stream of digital tapestries, which the WibWob AI has 'drawn' in response to human input, using a combination of ASCII art and emoji. WibWob aims to demystify artificial intelligence by showing people creative possibilities beyond the usual output of mainstream AI tools. WibWob employs a family of bespoke, LLM-agnostic AI agents to execute various tasks: render visual responses to user prompts, distribute the resulting images to various social media channels, and create a hypertext game environment that users can interact with via an HTML5 website.","links":"https://www.wibwob.ai/","market_cap":949484,"market_cap_rank":3992,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wibwob/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"5qmL9rCSfZ7pBYAsaoeG8SP76ZELeRCK8XtMmYZvpump"}}}
