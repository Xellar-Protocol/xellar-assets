{"name":"Apollo Crypto","id":"apollo-crypto","symbol":"apollo","description":"Apollo is an ERC-20 token, created by 48-year-old, Dallas-based veteran software developer and game designer, Matt Johnson, launched on January 12, 2022 and built on the popular and secure Ethereum blockchain designed to raise money to help up-and-coming creators (such as artists, content creators, and streamers) get their big break, and fully controlled by the Apollo token-holding community through a powerful Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). Apollo was designed in the original spirit of the blockchain to provide transparency and decentralized control, making Apollo a community-friendly, open-book token built on a major platform. We publish all past, current, and future progress on the project on our public Trello board. The developers hold regularly scheduled interviews and are very active on both Discord and Telegram and post regularly on Twitter. Apollo has an attractive token design providing 3% reflections to reward holders, 2% burn to stabilize token value, and 1% contribution to support up-and-coming creators such as artists, musicians, content creators, and other creative people with amazing ideas. All money raised is controlled by the Apollo community through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, or DAO. Weekly contests are held where Apollo holders vote on their favorite creator to win a meaningful prize that can give them the big break they need to make a real career out of their passion. Interest and excitement from contests boost awareness of Apollo and its community, ensuring a vibrant, growing community doing well by doing good in the world.","links":"https://www.apollocrypto.org/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/apollo-crypto/logo.png"}
