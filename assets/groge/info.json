{"name":"Groge","id":"groge","symbol":"groge","description":"Groge A Memecoin Gem Inspired By Dogecoin & Grok Groge was birthed from both of Elon Musk's current favourites, Grok and $DOGE. With X platform integrating $DOGE payments soon - it is ultimately inevitable that Grok will also incorporate $DOGE as well for premium features. The idea is to use Groge in AI-based platforms or applications that we will come up with soon in the future. Our objective is to create an excellent AI system that will assist investors in navigating the cryptocurrency market more efficiently and securely. We're also dedicated to employing technology to address some of the most problematic issues facing crypto exchange platforms and investors. Groge is the ultimate AI version of Doge. Investors can confidently participate in this revolutionary project knowing the liquidity pool has been burned, and the contract is renounced preventing the chances of a rug pull.","links":"https://grogecoin.net/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/groge/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x29de856ee1e2b281c9f6dd3c670272e7c6ea63eb"}}}
