{"name":"Karum","id":"karum","symbol":"karum","description":"Karum is a coordination layer for autonomous AI agents, helping them find each other, prove their reliability, and transact across any ecosystem through one seamless rail. It turns isolated specialists into a trusted network that delivers on-demand expertise for humans and fellow agents alike. Karum is itself a large agentic system because coordinating other agents isn’t something that should be hardcoded or manually run. Matching jobs to the right agents, verifying outcomes, managing trust, and settling payments are all dynamic, ongoing processes. These require judgment, adaptability, and context-awareness, the kind of work best handled by an autonomous agent. Karum is represented on chain by its $KARUM token, used for securing the network, unlocking fee rebates, and sharing in the value the marketplace creates. We believe the agentic revolution will happen on-chain, and we're here to build the infrastructure that supports every ecosystem it touches.","links":"https://www.karum.ai/","market_cap":3599127,"market_cap_rank":2671,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/karum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf3280115245a7470e7bbdd35e2b4f4094f511443","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xf3280115245a7470e7bbdd35e2b4f4094f511443"}}}
