{"name":"Realio","id":"realio-network","symbol":"rio","description":"Realio is a digital issuance, investment and peer-to-peer trading platform that utilizes a proprietary distributed network for issuing-on and interconnecting decentralized ecosystems. The platform leverages both a permissioned and permissionless architecture to satisfy the need for stringent securities regulations while allowing uniquely democratized access to investment products normally reserved for a select subset of institutional investors. We source investment opportunities across many asset classes with a focus on real estate private equity and we also provide the tools for 3rd party issuers to digitize their assets and raise capital within the network or use our tech stack as a private white-label solution. Our network architecture is modular, scalable, and enables built-in liquidity while distributing previously highly-centralized activities such as issuance and regulatory compliance across a private and secure network of independent participants.","links":"https://realio.fund/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/realio-network/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf21661d0d1d76d3ecb8e1b9f1c923dbfffae4097"},"algorand":{"decimal_place":7,"contract_address":"2751733"},"stellar":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":"RIO-GBNLJIYH34UWO5YZFA3A3HD3N76R6DOI33N4JONUOHEEYZYCAYTEJ5AK"}}}
