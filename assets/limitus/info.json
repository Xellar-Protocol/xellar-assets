{"name":"LIMITUS","id":"limitus","symbol":"lmt","description":"Autonomous tech for the connected future. LIMITUS is not just another automation tool, it’s a consumer-first platform designed to unify and elevate digital experiences. Whether you’re a trader optimizing multi-chain strategies, a professional streamlining workflows, or someone simplifying personal tasks, LIMITUS brings everything together into a single, intuitive interface. From managing DeFi portfolios to automating emails, scheduling, and commerce, LIMITUS bridges Web3 and Web2, turning fragmented processes into effortless flows. The DeFi ecosystem highlights this need. Today, traders face scattered transaction histories, fragmented liquidity data, and siloed sentiment analysis. LIMITUS eliminates these inefficiencies, not only aggregating data but also synthesizing, contextualizing, and executing it in real-time. Advanced AI tools like fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enable LIMITUS to continuously analyze and act on market trends, wallet activity, and yield opportunities. While some analytical platforms attempt to aggregate data, they often fail to deliver actionable insights or facilitate seamless execution. These tools provide raw metrics but cannot synthesize data into meaningful strategies or automate complex decisions. LIMITUS goes beyond mere aggregation by consolidating transaction histories, liquidity metrics, and sentiment indices into a single, actionable dashboard. Furthermore, it automates decision-making and execution, allowing users to effortlessly act on insights without being bogged down by manual processes—streamlining workflows and enabling faster, smarter trading decisions.","links":"https://www.limitus.ai/","market_cap":76403907,"market_cap_rank":675,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/limitus/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"86t88w3MKT38HChTBKBwEeb1RW1MeTceaW68qY2Vpump"}}}
