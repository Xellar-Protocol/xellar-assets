The meme resonated with the Solana community, leading enthusiasts to create the Trencher token as a homage and to support the original artist. Trencher’s identity centers around the eponymous cartoon character “Trencher,” and the project’s official website even features a Trencher image generator to encourage community creativity and engagement (allowing users to create their own Trencher-themed artwork).","links":"https://trenchersol.com/","market_cap":3695514,"market_cap_rank":2621,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/trencher/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"8ncucXv6U6epZKHPbgaEBcEK399TpHGKCquSt4RnmX4f","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/8ncucXv6U6epZKHPbgaEBcEK399TpHGKCquSt4RnmX4f"}}}
