{"name":"dTRINITY Staked dUSD","id":"dtrinity-staked-dusd","symbol":"sdusd","description":"dTRINITY is the world's first subsidized stablecoin protocol—a new DeFi primitive designed to supercharge on-chain credit markets. The protocol features a suite of decentralized stablecoins—each fully backed by exogenous, yield-bearing reserves. Unlike traditional models that reward passive holders or stakers on the supply side, dTRINITY redirects reserve earnings to stablecoin borrowers on the demand side—effectively paying users to borrow. This novel mechanism creates a higher supply-demand equilibrium, unlocking greater yields and capital efficiency for stablecoin users.","links":"https://dtrinity.org","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dtrinity-staked-dusd/logo.png","detail_platform":{"sonic":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x41a5477364bf60d8936b90310fecfda79593304e","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/sonic/tokens/0x41a5477364bf60d8936b90310fecfda79593304e"},"fraxtal":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0x58acc2600835211dcb5847c5fa422791fd492409","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/fraxtal/tokens/0x58acc2600835211dcb5847c5fa422791fd492409"}}}
