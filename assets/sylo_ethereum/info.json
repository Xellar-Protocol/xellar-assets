{"name":"Sylo","id":"sylo_ethereum","symbol":"sylo","description":"The Sylo Protocol provides confidential communication as a utility to the Sylo Confidential Communication App. The protocol acts as the confidential networking layer for the Sylo App, creating P2P connections and providing a way for users to interact and exchange data confidentially. The Sylo Protocol is being developed to provide fully decentralised confidential communication as a utility to all connected-apps within the Sylo ecosystem. Powered by blockchain and combined with other decentralised technologies, this Protocol will act as the networking layer for the Sylo DApp and 3rd-party connected-apps, while providing charging options for specific communications and services over the network. The fully decentralised Sylo DApp will be the 1st application built on the blockchain-based Sylo Protocol, using technology already commercialised in the Sylo App that’s currently used by thousands globally, available on Apple Store and Google Play Store. The Sylo DApp will be released in public beta in Q4 this year. Sylo is a decentralised communication and data exchange network powered by a layer 2 micropayments infrastructure and the $SYLO token. User-run Service Peers provide infrastructure to the network which allows developers and businesses to run privacy-first, unstoppable apps without deploying any infrastructure of their own. A staking architecture and unique probabilistic ticketing solution ensure minimal transaction fees and limitless scalability. This scalability is already on show within the projects flagship app, the Sylo Smart Wallet; a decentralised, private messenger and crypto wallet with over a quarter million users.","links":"https://www.sylo.io","market_cap":163034,"market_cap_rank":6233,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/sylo/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf293d23bf2cdc05411ca0eddd588eb1977e8dcd4","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xf293d23bf2cdc05411ca0eddd588eb1977e8dcd4"}},"is_native":false}
