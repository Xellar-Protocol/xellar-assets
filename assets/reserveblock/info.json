{"name":"ReserveBlock","id":"reserveblock","symbol":"rbx","description":"ReserveBlock RBX (ReserveBlock.IO) is an open-source p2p layer 1 blockchain built in C# that is fully autonomous, decentralized, and governed by validators through on-chain voting. RBX was developed with a finite purpose, to democratize mining without the burdens and frictions of Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS), but rather a liquid Proof of Assurance (PoA) consensus while passively earning randomized block rewards in a carbon neutral environment such as a laptop machine with at-will participation. The network is gasless with no lockups or holding periods and gives zero weight to a user's balance.","links":"https://www.reserveblock.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/reserveblock/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
