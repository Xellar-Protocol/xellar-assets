{"name":"Hive Token","id":"hive-token_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"hive","description":"Hive Token is a decentralized digital asset built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) that emphasizes transparency, honesty, and community-first values. Its design focuses on long-term sustainability through a deflationary token model with built-in burn mechanisms, while also supporting liquidity growth and ecosystem utility. The project aims to create a fair and trustworthy DeFi environment by: Implementing a 3% buy and sell tax where 1% is automatically burned, reducing supply over time, and 2% is reserved in the contract for future liquidity and development. Maintaining clear, trackable transactions on-chain to ensure transparency for all participants. Providing additional utility through staking options, on-chain games, and community-driven initiatives that increase engagement and expand token use cases. Hive Token’s mission is to deliver a token that is simple to understand, straightforward to use, and aligned with building long-term value for its holders.","links":"https://thehivetoken.com/","market_cap":138098,"market_cap_rank":6495,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/hive-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8fb024a51841e45891579bdc924550996b72b0fd","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x8fb024a51841e45891579bdc924550996b72b0fd"}},"is_native":false}
