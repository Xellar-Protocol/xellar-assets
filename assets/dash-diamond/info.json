{"name":"Dash Diamond","id":"dash-diamond","symbol":"dashd","description":"Dash Diamond is a coin that rewards social behavior in the DECENOMY ecosystem. Every economic system has a profit motive, so does DECENOMY. But in almost all ecosystems social behavior usually comes at a cost, which is fundamentally wrong. If people are socially secure and behave socially in such an economic system, then such an economic system is much more powerful.","links":"https://dashdiamond.net/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dash-diamond/logo.png"}
