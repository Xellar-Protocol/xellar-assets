{"name":"Bingo","id":"bingo-4_base","symbol":"bingo","description":"Not just any ape… Bingo was born lucky. While others aped into rugs, Bingo aped into jackpots. Every token he touched turned into gold (or at least a solid 3x before lunch). They say Bingo once flipped a free mint into a Lambo, blindfolded, with gas fees at zero. His secret? Pure, unfiltered BASE-chain luck and a little meme magic. Now, the legend lives on through $BINGO, the meme coin of the lucky few. Backed by vibes, powered by apes, and running wild on Base. Because when the market gets bananas… you'll want Bingo on your side.","links":"https://www.bingoonbase.xyz/","market_cap":15533.13,"market_cap_rank":10269,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bingo-4_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x1e339a1785b8114eef43e471c49c6ca327479aca","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x1e339a1785b8114eef43e471c49c6ca327479aca"}},"is_native":false}
