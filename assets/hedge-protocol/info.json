{"name":"Hedge Protocol","id":"hedge-protocol","symbol":"hdg","description":"HDG is one of the tokens issued by the Hedge Protocol which enables interest-free lending on the Solana Blockchain. Users are able to deposit collateral and take out USH stablecoin loans. The Hedge Protocol offers vaults with a minimum collateral ratio as low as 110% (90.0% LTV). USH is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar that is always redeemable for its underlying value - i.e. users are able to use it to purchase collateral back at any time. However a fee is added on top to ensure redemptions don't happen too often.","links":"https://www.hedge.so/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/hedge-protocol/logo.png"}
