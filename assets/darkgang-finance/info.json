{"name":"DarkGang Finance","id":"darkgang-finance","symbol":"darkg","description":"\"DarkGang Finance - the first ecosystem running around an algorithmic token pegged to DARK on Cronos chain Inspired by the most successful algorithmic stablecoin on Fantom: Tomb, and the most prominent algorithmic token project on Cronos: DarkCrypto, DarkGang is an algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the price of 1 DARK via seigniorage. The algorithm helps to increase the supply in event of the deflationary tendency of the token or reduce the supply in event of a decline in purchasing power of the token. Therefore, the supply and demand of the DARKG are balanced which helps to maintain its peg to 1 DARK in the long run. \"","links":"https://www.darkgang.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/darkgang-finance/logo.png","detail_platform":{"cronos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x2c43d9f78e4132fbe40bebb8ec5f61377472b2c0"}}}
