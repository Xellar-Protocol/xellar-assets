{"name":"Wave Swap","id":"wave-swap_solana","symbol":"wave","description":"WaveSwap v2 is a private DEX on Solana with bridges to ZCash & Starknet, built for the Zypherpunk Hackathon at WaveTek Labs. Glow Studio first introduced WaveSwap v1 as the world’s first vibe-coded app using NoahAI live on PumpFun. Now v2 evolves into Solana’s privacy-preserving DeFi layer, connecting to the most in-demand quantum resistant chains. Led by founder Rahim, long-time Solana ecosystem builder and engineered by an encryption expert from the Arcium fellowship. $WAVE powers staking and future app integrations across WaveTek. Stakers earn $WEALTH, creating a flywheel between privacy infra, user incentives, creator-driven liquidity, and RWAs. Stake $WAVE → Earn $WEALTH → Secure the Bag. Private. Secure. Fast. On Solana.","links":"https://securethebag.fun","market_cap":762796,"market_cap_rank":4059,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wave-swap_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"4AGxpKxYnw7g1ofvYDs5Jq2a1ek5kB9jS2NTUaippump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/4AGxpKxYnw7g1ofvYDs5Jq2a1ek5kB9jS2NTUaippump"}},"is_native":false}
