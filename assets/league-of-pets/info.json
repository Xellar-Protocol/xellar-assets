{"name":"League Of Pets","id":"league-of-pets","symbol":"glory","description":"'League of Pets' is a blockchain game that allows our users to own their playable characters as a tradeable NFT. 'Packs' can be purchased on our designated marketplace and players can also trade their cards on our platform. The reason behind this is so players have ownership of their 'in-game' assets, giving them the freedom to trade or sell their assets as they wish, creating a free macro economy. This is unlike traditional gaming, where users are bound by their micro transactions.","links":"https://leagueofpets.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/league-of-pets/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x483322bd0327e47b03fb1d39bffb8b94b81ef53e"}}}
