{"name":"Midas The Minotaur","id":"midas-the-minotaur","symbol":"midas","description":"MIDAS, Midas The Minotaur, is a 100% fair-launched community meme token. When launched, absolutely zero tokens were allocated to the development team. The Liquidity Pool of over $20,000 was then burned. Closely thereafter, we renounced our ownership of the contract. Each of these choices by the team were undertaken with the altruistic goals of establishing a solid and stable-trading token, but also a meme token in which investors could feel entirely confident placing their hard-earned money. MIDAS is truly forged by its developer community with complete transparency, open communication, and collaborative initiatives.","links":"https://www.midasonbase.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/midas-the-minotaur/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb8d59c7b33054beda610b2b2d38ea38694cdfabd","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xb8d59c7b33054beda610b2b2d38ea38694cdfabd"}}}
