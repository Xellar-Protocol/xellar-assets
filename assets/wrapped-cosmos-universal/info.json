{"name":"Wrapped Cosmos (Universal)","id":"wrapped-cosmos-universal","symbol":"uatom","description":"uATOM is a wrapped implementation of ATOM designed to enable trading and DeFi integrations across multiple blockchains. Cosmos (ATOM) is a cryptocurrency that powers an ecosystem of blockchains designed to scale and interoperate with each other. The team aims to \"create an Internet of Blockchains, a network of blockchains able to communicate with each other in a decentralized way.\" Universal is a cross-chain asset protocol that enables users to trade and utilize wrapped assets (uAssets) across multiple blockchains. uAssets are 1:1 backed representations of native cryptocurrencies, such as XRP, DOGE, and SUI, held in secure custody. This allows users to access and transact with assets that are not natively available on their preferred chains, without relying on bridges or centralized exchanges. Universal provides seamless trading, liquidity provision, and lending opportunities for uAssets, ensuring deep liquidity and security through institutional-grade custody and real-time proof of reserves.","links":"https://www.universal.xyz/tokens/uATOM","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wrapped-cosmos-universal/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6e934283dae5d5d1831cbe8d557c44c9b83f30ee","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x6e934283dae5d5d1831cbe8d557c44c9b83f30ee"}}}
