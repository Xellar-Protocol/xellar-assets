{"name":"Friend","id":"friend","symbol":"fren","description":"FREN Crypto is a decentralized financial protocol designed with an innovative approach to creating a fair and inclusive ecosystem. The protocol's central innovation is the Time Bank concept, which ties the value of FREN tokens to time. It creates a mechanism where the cost of newly issued tokens linearly increases over time, incentivizing long-term token holding and discouraging short-term speculation. FREN was created to address identified shortcomings in XEN's economic and multi-chain models. It introduces a balanced and sustainable economic model, controlling the inflation rate and providing substantial value backing for the tokens. The layered multi-chain model of FREN enables seamless interoperability with different blockchain networks, allowing for efficient cross-chain interactions and enhancing the overall value of FREN tokens. In terms of utility, FREN's Time Bank system rewards users based on their token holding duration, promoting long-term participation in the ecosystem. Additionally, FREN's dynamic APR Stake feature, based on parameters like average minting days, average staking days, and average staking amounts, adjusts staking rewards based on user commitment and contribution. FREN's ultimate aim is to revolutionize the crypto landscape by providing a robust, fair, and sustainable alternative to existing protocols. It aspires to empower users, foster a vibrant financial future, and contribute to the advancement of decentralized finance.","links":"https://chain.fenus.xyz","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/friend/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe6a768464b042a6d029394db1fdef360cb60bbeb"}}}
