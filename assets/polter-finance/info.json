{"name":"Polter","id":"polter-finance","symbol":"polter","description":"Polter is a decentralized non-custodial lending and borrowing platform where depositors earn a percentage of the interest charged for borrowing. Since the cessation of the $GEIST platform on Fantom chain, there has been a demand for something similar to be available to the community. $POLTER was created to satisfy this demand using the same smart contract. Learning an important lesson from the previous protocol, flash-loans will be disabled on Polter. This will help to minimize risks to users of the platform.","links":"https://polter.finance/","market_cap":226826,"market_cap_rank":5530,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/polter-finance/logo.png","detail_platform":{"fantom":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x5c725631fd299703d0a74c23f89a55c6b9a0c52f","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/ftm/tokens/0x5c725631fd299703d0a74c23f89a55c6b9a0c52f"},"sonic":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x44bd4f79a95cf04505f2dc5c8e2e4043f67c7b07","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/sonic/tokens/0x44bd4f79a95cf04505f2dc5c8e2e4043f67c7b07"},"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa0820613976b441e2c6a90e4877e2fb5f7d72552","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xa0820613976b441e2c6a90e4877e2fb5f7d72552"}}}
