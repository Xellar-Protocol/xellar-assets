{"name":"GORF","id":"gorf","symbol":"gorf","description":"GORF – The First Frog on Abstract GORF (/ɡɔːrf/) isn’t just a name—it’s a verb, a brand, a battle cry. As the first frog to land on Abstract, GORF carries a unique energy into the crypto space: bold, irreverent, and completely unfiltered. With a four-letter word that means to grow, to obsess, to reflect, to fight, GORF embodies a lifestyle of relentless forward motion. No limits. No permission. Just progress. In a digital landscape where memes have become movements, GORF is carving out its own lane. Ethereum has PEPE. Solana has FWOG. Abstract now has GORF—an unstoppable cultural force designed for those who refuse to be boxed in. Every time you GORF, you build. You push through. You transform resistance into momentum. GORF’s mission goes far beyond just being another token. It’s here to etch itself into internet lore, crashing through the gates of the Urban Dictionary, the Oxford Dictionary, and the cultural zeitgeist itself. With a foundation built on disruptive marketing and viral memetics, GORF is engineered for mass recognition and digital dominance. At its core, GORF is a rebellion disguised as a frog. It turns language into identity, and identity into action. Through every meme, every mention, every moment shared in the community, GORF expands its reach. This is not just a coinit’s a mindset that says: leap louder, leap further, leap different. GORF isn’t here to blend in. It’s here to GORF.","links":"https://www.gorf.life/","market_cap":338952,"market_cap_rank":5024,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gorf/logo.png","detail_platform":{"abstract":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x3520fc294a76c119c8924072c37992e39a626f85","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/abstract/tokens/0x3520fc294a76c119c8924072c37992e39a626f85"}}}
