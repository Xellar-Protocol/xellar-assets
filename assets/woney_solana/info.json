{"name":"WONEY","id":"woney_solana","symbol":"woney","description":"$WONEY is a community-driven meme token created to unify and represent the diverse meme communities in the crypto ecosystem. Its purpose is to serve as a cultural currency for meme enthusiasts, offering a fun and recognizable medium of exchange across different communities. A portion of the supply has already been burned, introducing scarcity from the beginning. The project is listed on decentralized exchanges and is fully transparent about its nature: $WONEY has no intrinsic financial value and should not be considered an investment. It is designed purely for entertainment, community engagement, and as a symbol of the meme culture within the digital asset space.","links":"https://www.woney.club/","market_cap":8072.42,"market_cap_rank":11587,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/woney_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"6bunJ76HV9SCDHkukezST3VKzQKJ8JtjTQQ92UD7pump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/6bunJ76HV9SCDHkukezST3VKzQKJ8JtjTQQ92UD7pump"}},"is_native":false}
