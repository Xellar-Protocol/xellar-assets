{"name":"bemo Staked TON","id":"bemo-staked-ton","symbol":"stton","description":"stTON is a derivative token offered by bemo, a pioneering liquid staking platform on The Open Network (TON) blockchain. bemo platform was designed for individual and institutional TON token holders. It provided a non-custodial staking solution, allowing users full control over their tokens. stTON is a liquid staking token, representing staked TON on bemo, maintaining liquidity, and allowing holders to participate in DeFi applications while accruing staking rewards. TON holders using bemo platform can engage in the network's validation process without the traditional barriers associated with staking. This includes overcoming the need for extensive blockchain knowledge, high-performance hardware, and large minimum stakes. Traditional staking results in illiquidity, as tokens are locked until the end of the validation round. bemo addresses these issues by enabling any amount of TON tokens to be staked, thereby democratizing access to the TON PoS validation process.","links":"https://bemo.finance/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bemo-staked-ton/logo.png","detail_platform":{"the-open-network":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"EQDNhy-nxYFgUqzfUzImBEP67JqsyMIcyk2S5_RwNNEYku0k"}}}
