{"name":"Vested XOR","id":"vested-xor","symbol":"vxor","description":"vXOR is vested XOR. It is called vested XOR because it is “turned into” XOR over time by taking a part of the daily burned XOR amount and buying back and burning vXOR. As it eventually can be turned into XOR, it is a companion token. All new vXOR has to be backed by output and will be created by on-chain governance, voted on by XOR token holders. 99% of the daily remint of XOR is proposed to buy back and burn vXOR.","links":"https://sora.org/","market_cap":4220050,"market_cap_rank":2010,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/vested-xor/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":null}}}
