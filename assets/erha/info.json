{"name":"Erha","id":"erha","symbol":"二哈","description":"Erha is a Chinese meme project themed around the Husky dog, designed as a cultural community token. Beyond its meme origin, Erha is building a multi-chain launchpad and decentralized exchange (DEX) that currently operates on Solana and OKX’s X Layer network. The project aims to provide a playful yet functional entry point for community-driven tokens, enabling new meme assets to launch, trade, and grow across ecosystems while preserving the grassroots spirit of on-chain culture.","links":"https://2ha.fun/","market_cap":8019501,"market_cap_rank":1979,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/erha/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"ASRNzwDpYWseimGQh3GootWLphpuMe3cUnpoH4mFbonk","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/ASRNzwDpYWseimGQh3GootWLphpuMe3cUnpoH4mFbonk"}}}
