{"name":"Mantle Index Four Fund","id":"mantle-index-four-fund","symbol":"mi4","description":"This fund aspires to be the crypto equivalent of the S&P 500, bringing investors exposure to a selection of major cryptocurrencies with the ease of traditional investment products and allowing investors to access crypto beta without the complexities of wallets or individual asset selection. The fund rebalances quarterly and integrates staking strategies such as Mantle’s mETH, Bybit’s bbSOL, and Ethena’s sUSDe, aiming to enhance returns through DeFi-native yield without sacrificing compliance or investor protections. All assets leverage institutional-grade infrastructure, including Fireblocks and multi-signature controls, with qualified custodians under consideration for added security in the future. MI4 is designed to become a new financial primitive—a bridge between TradFi and DeFi—positioned to serve as a benchmark for crypto beta exposure with yield enhancement.","links":"https://securitize.io/primary-market/mantle-index-four-fund","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mantle-index-four-fund/logo.png","detail_platform":{"mantle":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0x671642ac281c760e34251d51bc9eef27026f3b7a","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/mantle/tokens/0x671642ac281c760e34251d51bc9eef27026f3b7a"}}}
