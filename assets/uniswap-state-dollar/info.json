{"name":"unified Stable Dollar","id":"uniswap-state-dollar","symbol":"usd","description":"The aim of the Uniswap State Dollar (uSD) protocol is to build the most secure and resilient stablecoin on Ethereumâ€”ever. Independent from any off-chain issuer, it is fortified against the risks inherent to all other stablecoins, and free of the anxiety that pervades the industry. uSD achieves this unprecedented level of stability by collateralizing other stablecoins. If any of them lose value or fail, it can simply rebalance itself to leverage the security of the others. And to account for excess due to fees in their pools, it can rebalance itself in another way.","links":"https://www.unifihub.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/uniswap-state-dollar/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x44086035439e676c02d411880fccb9837ce37c57"}}}
