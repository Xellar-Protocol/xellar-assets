{"name":"Snapy","id":"snapy","symbol":"spy","description":"Detailed Project Description: SNAPY is a next-generation Web3, reward-based social media application that introduces a new ecosystem that merges lifestyle, passion, and user-generated income inside a single mobile application. Simply take a picture, add a description, including a few relevant hashtags, post it, and wait for people to comment or upvote your post. The amount you earn is based on the amount and the quality of upvotes you receive from users of SNAPY. Unlike on any other popular social media site, where 100% of the platform’s value and revenue goes to the corporate shareholders. SNAPY enables all users to earn a fair share of the overall revenue, as well as a creative influence within the network, through a cryptocurrency reward token “SPY”. SNAPY turns the traditional social media hierarchy around by giving its users the opportunity to receive financial compensation directly from their content and engagement, earning real revenue from receiving “Votes” directly via blockchain technology.","links":"https://snapy.photos/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/snapy/logo.png"}
