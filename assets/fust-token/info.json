{"name":"FUST Token","id":"fust-token","symbol":"fust","description":"FUST (Fusion token) is the companion token of FUSD - with tokenomics which mirror those of a typical cryptocurrency. FUST can be placed in the FUST Fusion Miner and used to mine free FUSD. FUST has tokenomics which mirror those of a typical cryptocurrency, and allows those Degens who buy into the FUSD philosophy - but who also enjoy the thrill of chasing fast green candles - to make their play within the structure of the FUSD ecosystem and benefit from the best of both worlds; the possibility of a fast ride upwards whilst earning a passive income paid in our appreciating stable token courtesy of their FUST bag.","links":"http://fusdcrypto.com","market_cap":5407470,"market_cap_rank":2297,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/fust-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x695579cfe2b2d9066fddc9ef3462b6ae05e127c3","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x695579cfe2b2d9066fddc9ef3462b6ae05e127c3"}}}
