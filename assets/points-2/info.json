{"name":"POINTS","id":"points-2","symbol":"points","description":"POINTS is a memecoin deployed on the Hyperliquid blockchain as a joke in the aftermath of the announcement of a second season of points. POINTS has no deployer allocation and was deployed with 20% of supply committed permanently to the Hyperliquidity order book module. POINTS was airdropped to holders of HFUN and PURR. A large holder of HFUN received 10% of supply as a result, but dumped it within days to near 0 due to unfounded concerns around its deployment. The token's image is inspired by their profile picture as a result.","links":"","market_cap":1937983,"market_cap_rank":2304,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/points-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"hyperliquid":{"decimal_place":5,"contract_address":"0xbb03842e1f71ed27ed8fa012b29affd4"}}}
