{"name":"zkLend","id":"zklend","symbol":"zend","description":"ZEND is the native utility/governance token which also provides the economic incentives which will be distributed to encourage users to exert efforts towards contribution and participation in the ecosystem on zkLend, thereby creating a mutually beneficial system where every participant is fairly compensated for its efforts. ZEND is an integral and indispensable part of zkLend, because without ZEND, there would be no incentive for users to expend resources to participate in activities or provide services for the benefit of the entire ecosystem on zkLend. Given that additional ZEND will be awarded to a user based only on its actual usage, activity and efforts made on zkLend and/or proportionate to the frequency and volume of transactions, users of zkLend and/or holders of ZEND which did not actively participate will not receive any ZEND incentives.","links":"https://zklend.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/zklend/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
