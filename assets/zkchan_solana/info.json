{"name":"zkChan","id":"zkchan_solana","symbol":"zkc","description":"zkChan is a next-generation privacy protocol designed to bring secure, confidential, and verifiable transactions to the modular, multi-chain world of Web3. The project combines zero-knowledge SNARK proofs with high-speed execution environments like Solana to enable private transfers, shielded balances, and cross-chain movement of assets without exposing user identities, amounts, or transaction history. At its core, zkChan introduces a shielded pool architecture, a plonkish ZK proving system, and a Cross-Chain Privacy Bridge (CPB) that allows users to burn assets privately on one chain and mint them privately on another with no linkability. This creates a universal privacy layer that can extend across ecosystems such as Solana, BSC, TRON, TON, and more. The protocol also includes a three-key model (spend, view, audit) that enables optional compliance and selective disclosure for businesses or institutions, without compromising user privacy. Developers can integrate zkChan easily through its SDKs and APIs, enabling private swaps, shielded payments, cross-chain operations, and privacy-enhanced DeFi. Overall, zkChan aims to become the foundational privacy infrastructure for Web3 — scalable, compliant-ready, and powered by zero-knowledge technology.","links":"https://zk-chan.fun/","market_cap":3608.67,"market_cap_rank":12767,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/zkchan_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"3QQwbsqNMzy6JjwmoM9FJQ74ei1FmfoYj5jT3EhPpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/3QQwbsqNMzy6JjwmoM9FJQ74ei1FmfoYj5jT3EhPpump"}},"is_native":false}
