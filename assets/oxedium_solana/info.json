{"name":"Oxedium","id":"oxedium_solana","symbol":"oxe","description":"Oxedium is a single-sided liquidity protocol that allows users to provide liquidity with one token instead of a pair or multiple tokens, as required by traditional AMMs. The protocol uses internal algorithms to maintain a constant balance of initial liquidity in its pools through trader incentives, offering optimal routes for token swaps. Essentially, Oxedium can be seen as a form of staking with a broader selection of supported tokens, yet offering yields comparable to liquidity provision in the DeFi ecosystem. The mission of the protocol is to make liquidity provision as simple and intuitive as staking for liquidity providers, and to attract users who currently prefer to hold their crypto in wallets because existing earning methods are too complex for them.","links":"https://oxedium.com","market_cap":493389,"market_cap_rank":4597,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/oxedium/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"CYtqp57NEdyetzbDfxVoJ19MWHvvVCQBL9jfFjXWpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/CYtqp57NEdyetzbDfxVoJ19MWHvvVCQBL9jfFjXWpump"}},"is_native":false}
