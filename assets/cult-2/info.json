{"name":"CULT","id":"cult-2","symbol":"cult","description":"CULT: The Call to Awakening. Long ago, in a forgotten corner of the cryptoverse, visionary \"Cultists\" sought to liberate minds from the confines of centralized control. They forged CULT, a symbol of rebellion and an unrelenting pursuit of truth. CULT is the token of those who dare to question, to dismantle old paradigms, and to uncover the mysteries of the XRPL. Its followers, the Cultists, spread cryptic messages and memes, urging others to \"wake up\" and join the movement. Their motto: “Burn the old, and build the new.” CULT represents: Freedom: A rallying cry for decentralization and self-sovereignty. Mystery: A beacon for those who seek to uncover hidden truths of XRPL. Chaos: A reminder that disruption precedes growth.","links":"https://obey-the-cult.gitbook.io/obey-the-cult","market_cap":1243353,"market_cap_rank":3868,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cult-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"xrp":{"decimal_place":0,"contract_address":"43554C5400000000000000000000000000000000.rCULtAKrKbQjk1Tpmg5hkw4dpcf9S9KCs","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/xrpl/tokens/43554C5400000000000000000000000000000000.rCULtAKrKbQjk1Tpmg5hkw4dpcf9S9KCs"}}}
