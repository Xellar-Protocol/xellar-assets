{"name":"VeUSD","id":"veusd","symbol":"veusd","description":"VeUSD, built upon the VIP-180 token standard, is a stablecoin created by Stably, a US-based asset tokenization infrastructure provider who partners with regulated financial institutions to compliantly launch stablecoins and tokenized assets. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that typically maintain a peg to national currencies on blockchains like VeChainThor digital cash. Regulated, fiat-backed stablecoins like VeUSD are fully backed by physical reserves of fiat money and can be redeemed at a 1:1 ratio. VeUSD avoids the price volatility of traditional cryptocurrencies, while still retaining many of their useful characteristics such as low-cost, high-speed transactions and cross-border payments without the high fees of credit card processors or money transfer companies.","links":"https://www.vechain.org/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/veusd/logo.png"}
