I’ve been playing online poker professionally for 15+ years, I’ve also traveled the world playing live cash games. Beyond poker, I’m passionate about the $gib coin on Solana and about building a strong community around it. Now on top of everything I do daily for $gib I want to contribute to $gib with my own coin, which will be created this week. Project Objective: The goal is to create an alliance between Pump and Bonk, showing full transparency to the community. 70% of the fees → support & promote $gib 20% of the fees → support my own coin, to generate more volume, more fees for $gib & activity 10% of the fees → content creation, web dev & related expenses 0% for me We’ll be streaming daily on Pump playing poker, doing surprise giveaways, and more. Get ready, incredible details coming soon","links":"https://staticky.fun/","market_cap":3173.76,"market_cap_rank":12884,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/staticky/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"Dn5cVZ9AvJVzk5b7za9YNkzkCMbrXkPvEbC4wMBMpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/Dn5cVZ9AvJVzk5b7za9YNkzkCMbrXkPvEbC4wMBMpump"}},"is_native":false}
