{"name":"Borpa","id":"borpa","symbol":"borpa","description":"Borpa. Just Borpa. Borpa was born from a profound desire to honor the web3 industry, reflecting the countless hours I’ve poured into it. My idealistic dream was to merge the richness of the crypto culture with the viral potential of DeFi concepts. What’s the utility about? The utility is culture. Back To The Basics Borpa was built under the promises of being “The Next Generation Memecoin”. A truly beautiful thing that could only happen with truly beautiful partners. These episodes have made me realize how disconnected I was from the reality of the industry I was building in. The core concept of a memecoin is simple and viral, designed to be easily accessible. This experience has been a true ego death, and it’s time to embrace what truly makes a memecoin visible: its community.","links":"https://justborpa.com/","market_cap":120003,"market_cap_rank":5968,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/borpa/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"Bv2ajiWdngTyRFabXCKiwGDJh5SEfJwoRPkkTQ2uf6EE"}}}
