{"name":"Moolah","id":"moolah_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"moolah","description":"$Moolah is a meme token inspired by the mascot of ListaDAO, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol. Launched on the Flap.sh platform, $Moolah has garnered attention due to its official authorization from ListaDAO and its strategic positioning within the DeFi and meme coin ecosystems. $Moolah’s official authorization by ListaDAO sets it apart from many other meme coins, which often lack formal endorsements. According to posts on X, ListaDAO has actively promoted $Moolah, with mentions of its mascot status and interactions with the token’s official account (@Moolah_bsc ). This backing suggests a strategic alignment with ListaDAO’s broader goals, potentially positioning $Moolah as a “blue-chip” meme coin within the ecosystem. Additionally, Flap.sh and even Binance Chain have shown support through social media engagement, hinting at broader institutional interest.","links":"https://moolahbnb.com","market_cap":2020198,"market_cap_rank":2966,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/moolah/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xbab528425edb1e0e36d3719bc3307d9c8cce8888","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xbab528425edb1e0e36d3719bc3307d9c8cce8888"}},"is_native":false}
