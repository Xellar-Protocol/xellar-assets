{"name":"ONYX","id":"kamigotchi-onyx","symbol":"onyx","description":"$ONYX is the the token of Kamigotchi, a fully onchain idle MMORPG inspired by Runescape, Neopets, and Maplestory. $ONYX is a bToken powered by Baseline Markets, with each token backed by an underlying reserve of $ETH, which creates a max drawdown price known as the BLV. Kamigotchi World itself revolves around the Kamigotchi, procedurally generated NFT-pets which live onchain. Each Kamigotchi has their own unique traits, stats, identity, and progression. Kamigotchi harvest MUSU, an in-game currency, and gain XP and level up in the process! $ONYX is currently used for rerolling Kamigotchi back to the gacha pool, for resurrecting Kamigotchi, and soon for renaming and respeccing Kamigotchi. A bridge will be added to allow $ONYX to exist as an item ingame, which will be exchangeable with other players for MUSU. More utility will be added as the project continues.","links":"https://app.kamigotchi.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kamigotchi-onyx/logo.png","detail_platform":{"initia":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0xd310d6ebd7c9ffb6d63bdc5d3e3227a767149411e5ab711b483635adb2f4c85f","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/initia/tokens/0xd310d6ebd7c9ffb6d63bdc5d3e3227a767149411e5ab711b483635adb2f4c85f"}}}
