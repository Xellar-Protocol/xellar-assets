{"name":"FUZE","id":"fuze-token","symbol":"fuze","description":"What is FUZE? FUZE Token is a fully community-driven social experiment and the world’s first self-deflationary currency with a supply of 1000 tokens and a 5% burn rate. Why FUZE? A difference between FUZE and most other deflationary projects is that there is no dev holding/allocation — every token was distributed fairly by airdrops. This distinguishes FUZE as a token created entirely for its community. What’s the purpose of the FUZE project? Our main goal is to build a community that decides in which direction the FUZE Token should go. Future functions or use-cases can be built by any member of the community. Of course, the main function right now is the deflationary token model — this means the total supply decreases with each transaction. Why a deflationary token? We like the concept of this kind of token model because it exemplifies the hodler mentality. Let’s say you buy FUZE Tokens for 1 ETH — you are incentivized to hold your FUZE because each time you send it to another address, 5% will be burned. This naturally encourages hodling, rather than sending. This token burn will naturally drive token appreciation through driving an increase in scarcity vs demand.","links":"https://fuzetoken.net","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/fuze-token/logo.png"}
