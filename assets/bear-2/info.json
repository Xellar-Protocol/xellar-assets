{"name":"Bear","id":"bear-2","symbol":"bear","description":"Bear ($BEAR) is a unique and charming meme coin that has captured the hearts of the cryptocurrency community. It derives its name and inspiration from a lovable canine companion belonging to one of the co-founders of Avalanche, a prominent blockchain platform. The absence of a traditional roadmap sets Bear apart, emphasizing a laid-back and fun approach to its development. Unlike many cryptocurrencies that detail a structured plan for future development, Bear relies on the spontaneous and endearing nature of its canine muse. The absence of a formal roadmap doesn't imply a lack of ambition; rather, it suggests a commitment to embracing the organic growth and community-driven spirit that has become synonymous with meme coins.","links":"https://www.avaxbear.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bear-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"avalanche":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x19c79f282d151995d91f6dbdda2739701f9c47aa"}}}
