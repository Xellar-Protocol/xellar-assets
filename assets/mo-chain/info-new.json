{"name":"MO Chain","id":"mo-chain","symbol":"mo","description":"What is MO? MO utilizes decentralized blockchain technology to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions without the need for central authorities or traditional banks. Its issuance of MO coins and transaction management are collectively overseen by the network. MO is designed for public access, ensuring no single entity has ownership or control, and inviting everyone to participate. With its unique properties, MO introduces innovative applications beyond the capabilities of prior payment systems, thanks to a secure staking consensus mechanism, rapid block times, and a transparent, inclusive approach to blockchain technology. What is Proof of Real Work? MO Chain revolutionizes earning digital currency by integrating it with everyday online activities. Users can earn MO coins simply by engaging with our publicly available services. This innovative approach, which we call “backed by proof of real work,” allows the value of MO coins to be directly tied to actual user contributions and interactions. Unlike traditional systems, where digital currency is obtained through complex computational tasks, MO rewards users for the real, valuable work they do on our ecosystem, making the digital economy accessible and rewarding for everyone. For instance, when a user shares a viral post on our social network or creates a viral video on our video platform, they receive MO coins as a reward. This system not only incentivizes quality content creation but also ensures that users are compensated for their contributions to the platform’s ecosystem. How many MO coins are there in circulation? The genesis of MO Coin introduced an initial supply of 1 billion coins, setting the stage for a balanced and scalable economy. This initial supply was determined with the dual aims of providing sufficient liquidity for the ecosystem’s functioning and establishing a foundation for value appreciation and utility expansion.","links":"https://mochain.app","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mo-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
