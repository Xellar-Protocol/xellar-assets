{"name":"BRCStarter","id":"brcstarter_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"brcst","description":"As the pioneer in blockchain and cryptocurrency, Bitcoin set the stage for subsequent innovations such as NFTs, smart contracts, and tokenization. Despite its rarely-modified protocol providing stability, Bitcoin has faced criticism for appearing somewhat stagnant. However, the introduction of Ordinals has injected new vitality into Bitcoin's ecosystem, propelling rapid progress in 2023. Ordinals, a protocol layered onto the Bitcoin blockchain, facilitates the creation of NFTs and BRC-20 tokens without altering Bitcoin's code. Similar to Ethereum's ERC-20, the BRC-20 standard supports diverse token projects, enriching Bitcoin's appeal for both entertainment and education. BRC-20 tokens are cultivating a promising landscape for future developments and opportunities, reminiscent of Ethereum's growth in 2017. BRCStarter is committed to contributing to the future trajectory of BRC-20 tokens by providing an app that enables projects to establish a thriving ecosystem for their activities.","links":"https://www.brcstarter.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/brcstarter/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x22830be0954ff3bf7929405c488b1bba54a7e0d3","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x22830be0954ff3bf7929405c488b1bba54a7e0d3"}},"is_native":false}
