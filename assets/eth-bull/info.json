{"name":"ETH BULL","id":"eth-bull","symbol":"bull","description":"Once upon a time, in the digital pastures of the Ethereum blockchain, there lived a legendary creature known as the Bull. This wasn't just any bull; it was the embodiment of innovation with hooves of volatility and horns of DeFi. But, in a twist of fate or a glitch in the code, the Bull strayed too far from its digital home, lost in the vast internet wilderness for years, witnessing the crypto world's ups and downs. Years passed until, in 2024, whispers of the Bull's sightings spread across social media, leading to a grand quest for its return. With the aid of clever developers, the Bull navigated back through the complexities of code, scams, and mining traps, finding its way back to the Ethereum blockchain. Its return was celebrated with a digital stampede, marking a new era. Now, the Bull leads a grand stampede of lost souls, investors, and dreamers towards uncharted heights of blockchain potential. Under its guidance, they charge towards a future where smart contracts and DeFi define the landscape, proving that even in the chaotic realm of cryptocurrency, there's always a path back home, with the only constant being change and the promise of upward mobility.","links":"https://www.ethbulltoken.io/","market_cap":462168,"market_cap_rank":4688,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/eth-bull/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x8c41455aaa8d6aba3150058d4964349294bf78a3"}}}
