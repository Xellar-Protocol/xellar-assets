Welcome to Retro Kids where memes turn into millions. Retro Kids is a community-driven meme token built on the Solana blockchain, inspired by 80s and 90s nostalgia. With a focus on fun, culture, and internet humor, RKID brings together fans of retro gaming, vintage cartoons, and childhood memories in a decentralized, low-fee ecosystem. The token has no inherent utility or roadmap and exists purely as a cultural and collectible digital asset.","links":"https://retrokids.fun/","market_cap":4091.76,"market_cap_rank":12622,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/retro-kids/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"Bb43TPQQh5TaoCtFLGjfwAhqcLumN6mTUmCy2ojjpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/Bb43TPQQh5TaoCtFLGjfwAhqcLumN6mTUmCy2ojjpump"}},"is_native":false}
