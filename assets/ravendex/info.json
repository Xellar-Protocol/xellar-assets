{"name":"Ravendex","id":"ravendex","symbol":"rave","description":"Ravendex is the first non-custodial Decentralized Exchange on the Cardano Blockchain that allows swift and near instant transfer of assets and liquidity between native Cardano tokens and ADA. We are a cross chain exchange on The Cardano Blockchain that operates using the EUTXO model known for itâ€™s unique features like the ability to have shared liquidity be split among different assets on The Cardano Ecosystem. This is also one of the very first projects on The Cardano Ecosystem to conceive the idea of a crypto asset lending and borrowing platform using the recently released Alonzo Hard Fork update which allows smart contracts to deposit assets and collect interests using pre-defined set of rules.","links":"https://ravendex.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ravendex/logo.png","detail_platform":{"cardano":{"decimal_place":0,"contract_address":"14a3455f71c435a04ea1fdb50a3ef4c1cab0e79fb1565627ac66a57552415645"}}}
