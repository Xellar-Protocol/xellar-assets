{"name":"Odin Protocol","id":"odin-protocol","symbol":"odin","description":"Odin is built on the cosmos SDK, bringing verified user data on-chain, keeping user anonymity & eliminating insufficient data. 99.9% of the world’s data is NOT onchain. This is one of the biggest challenges for the Web2 to Web3 transition, a centralized bottleneck for trustworthy decentralized apps’ user data access.. Actual demand will only come when the data from Web2 to Web3 can be optimized with verification, decentralization & privacy. Fully decentralized verified data is the money of the future. ODIN is providing this exact solution for the mass adoption of web3, developing a unique data-centric blockchain ecosystem where the user data is self-refined and authenticated with the power of oracles. With the growth of data adoption in the web3 space, the demand for operations supported by ODIN Protocol will increase drastically! Accordingly, Odin token adoption will be directly proportional to the mainstream adoption of web3 and data spaces.","links":"https://www.odinprotocol.io","market_cap":497637,"market_cap_rank":4605,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/odin-protocol/logo.png","detail_platform":{"cosmos":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"ibc/c360ef34a86d334f625e4cbb7da3223aea97174b61f35bb3758081a8160f7d9b"}}}
