{"name":"Bitcoin Bull","id":"bitcoin-bull-2_ethereum","symbol":"btcbull","description":"BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) is a meme-powered Ethereum-based token designed to help users benefit from Bitcoin’s price growth without owning Bitcoin directly. Holders earn real Bitcoin ($BTC) airdrops when BTC hits key price milestones ($150K, $200K, $250K), plus benefit from deflationary token burns as BTC rises. The project combines meme culture with real Bitcoin-linked utility, offering an accessible, community-driven way to participate in Bitcoin’s rise.","links":"https://btcbulltoken.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bitcoin-bull-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc3f822e94c321dd3ee53ca46b78098ea79b7ec8d","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xc3f822e94c321dd3ee53ca46b78098ea79b7ec8d"}},"is_native":false}
