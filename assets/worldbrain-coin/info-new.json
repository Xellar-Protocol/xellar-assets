{"name":"WorldBrain Coin","id":"worldbrain-coin","symbol":"wbc","description":"WorldBrain is an innovative project initiated by the WorldBrains Foundation, a subsidiary of OpenAI. Unlike ChatGPTâ€™s LLM, it adopts the WorldModel framework. Based on the WorldModel, it combines artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and blockchain technology through Web3 to develop a comprehensive, decentralized artificial intelligence system. WorldBrain adopts the World Model, a large-scale intelligent neural network system that mimics the modeling of the human brain. We are capable of perceiving and understanding various information and features of the external world. Based on these perceptual inputs, the human brain constructs a mental model that includes abstractions and generalizations of the structure, attributes, behaviors, and patterns of the world.","links":"https://worldbrains.org/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/worldbrain-coin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0x7ae9ab13fc8945323b778b3f8678145e80ec2efb"}}}
