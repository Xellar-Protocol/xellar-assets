{"name":"AI XOVIA","id":"ai-xovia_solana","symbol":"aix","description":"AI XOVIA is an autonomous, hybrid intelligence project designed to address fundamental problems in financial markets, such as inefficiencies, information asymmetry, and manipulative actions. The project's mission is to create a fair, stable, and profitable environment through technology and transparency. The system's core is an advanced Artificial Intelligence that observes and analyzes vast amounts of data 24/7 from global crypto, forex, and stock markets, as well as on-chain data and social sentiment. This \"AI Brain\" formulates strategies which are then executed by a network of 1,000 elite traders, designated as the \"Human Processing Unit (HPU)\". This hybrid model synthesizes data-driven analysis with human intuition, acting through a coordinated strategy called \"Operation Hydra\" to foster a stable market environment and protect retail participants through its \"Retail Shield\" mechanisms. The native ecosystem token, $AIX, serves multiple functions. As an \"Access Key,\" holding $AIX grants users access to exclusive trading signals generated by the AI through the AI XOVIA Trade Signal App. Value accrual is driven by \"The Momentum Engine,\" a mechanism that uses a portion of profits from the AI's external market activities to perform continuous buybacks of the $AIX token from the open market, creating sustained buy-pressure. The token also provides holders with priority and advantages in future projects and airdrops developed by AI XOVIA.","links":"https://aixovia.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ai-xovia/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"AiXxRGmRc5oDiFXbEeRX9obPpr3Zir7rks1ef2NjddiF","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/AiXxRGmRc5oDiFXbEeRX9obPpr3Zir7rks1ef2NjddiF"}},"is_native":false}
