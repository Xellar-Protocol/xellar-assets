{"name":"The Story of Binance","id":"the-story-of-binance_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"币安故事","description":"$币安故事 is a memecoin on BNB Chain created as a community tribute to Binance's journey, founded by Changpeng Zhao and He Yi. Launched on October 13, 2025, it features a 1 billion supply, 0% tax, renounced contract, and locked LP for trading stability. Traded on PancakeSwap via BNB swaps with recommended slippage 3%, it lacks inherent utility, relying on speculative value driven by Binance-related narratives shared on X and Telegram. The project reflects BNB Chain's meme coin trend, with a website providing tokenomics, purchase guides, and balance/swap tracking. Designed for broad accessibility with BEP-20 compatibility, it thrives on social momentum rather than complex DeFi features, appealing to Binance's global community without governance or staking mechanisms.","links":"https://www.bnbstory.xyz/","market_cap":10560.93,"market_cap_rank":11065,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/the-story-of-binance/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x29d4236a49f2f633898cef4b4dcd0c67c7c357f1","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x29d4236a49f2f633898cef4b4dcd0c67c7c357f1"}},"is_native":false}
