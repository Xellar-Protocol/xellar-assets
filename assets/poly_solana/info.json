Evidence of Demand: • The community independently launched a $POLY coin on Solana inspired by the mascot idea. • The token reached a $2 million market cap, generated $10 million in trading volume, and now has over 3,500 holders. • This demonstrates strong community interest and a clear demand for a market around Poly’s official adoption. The dedicated X community has over 700 active members. Why This Market Matters: The mascot concept has organically become one of the most viral Polymarket-related narratives, bridging the prediction market audience with Solana’s meme coin culture.
