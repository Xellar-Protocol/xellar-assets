{"name":"Qatar Inu Token","id":"qatar-inu-token","symbol":"qatar","description":"Qatar Inu is building a betting platform for the World Cup, where players will be able to bet on their favorite picks and win prizes. In addition, we are rolling out NFT's: each NFT will represent a team in the World Cup, whichever team wins the World Cup the holders of that team's NFT will win the prize pool. The Qatar Inu betting platform will roll out to be used on the 2022 World Cup. Our platform will feature staking rewards, and offer incentives for staking to receive portions of the rake. Our Peer-to-Peer betting pools will be transparent, and the house will only collect a portion of the rake. THE QATAR INU NFT COLLECTION WILL FEATURE EACH NFT'S OF EACH TEAM IN THE WORLD CUP. HOLDERS WILL MINT A RANDOM TEAM, AND AS THE WORLD CUP PROGRESSES EACH NFT WILL MOVE FORWARD, OR BE DISQUALIFIED WITH ITS CORRESPONDING TEAM. WHICHEVER TEAM WINS THE WORLD CUP, THE HOLDERS OF THAT TEAM'S NFT WILL WIN THE PRIZE POOL","links":"https://qatarinu.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/qatar-inu-token/logo.png"}
