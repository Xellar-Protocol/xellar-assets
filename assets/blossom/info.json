{"name":"Blossom","id":"blossom","symbol":"sakura","description":"$SAKURA is an ERC20 token that represents optimism and renewal in the fast-moving world around us. Just as life itself, cherry blossoms have a beautiful yet brief lifespan as they bloom for just a few weeks, before falling when reaching full efflorescense. In Japanese beliefs the flower symbolizes the transience of life. The full meaning of cherry blossoms runs very deep as itâ€™s a visual expression of the endless cycle of life, death and rebirth. Tied to themes of mental clarity and being present, Sakura and its timeless metaphors of human existence will bring wealth, joy and abundance to those who partake in the celebrations which date back centuries and are practiced worldwide.","links":"https://cherrysakura.com","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/blossom/logo.png"}
