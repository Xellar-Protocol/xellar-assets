El Hippo is a long-term project, and we’re dedicated to putting our tokens back into the community to foster real growth over time. El Hippo is making big moves, and we’re here to stay! Project is not short-sighted like some of the other meme coins out there. By using the token to fund the growth of the project including listings, development, and partnerships, and by burning tokens as time goes on to reward community loyalty, project team thinks El Hippo could be one of the biggest meme coins in crypto. As explained in our Rewards section, the token is connected to the minting of project NFTs which will play a major role in driving project growth.","links":"https://hipptoken.com","market_cap":938101,"market_cap_rank":2638,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/el-hippo/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x7b744eea1deca2f1b7b31f15ba036fa1759452d7"}}}
