{"name":"Poof Token","id":"poof-token","symbol":"poof","description":"Houdini Swap is a service that anonymizes blockchain transactions using Monero as a tunnel between exchanges. By using Monero, Houdini Swap breaks any on-chain link between sender and receiver. Our mission is to bridge the inherent disconnect between public blockchains and the individual's right to privacy. As blockchain continues to become integrated into the traditional financial ecosystem, the idea of paying for services with crypto and exposing your on-chain wallet history to the public is unacceptable. Privacy is security.","links":"https://houdiniswap.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/poof-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x888cea2bbdd5d47a4032cf63668d7525c74af57a"}}}
