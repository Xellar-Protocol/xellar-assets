{"name":"Kindness For The Soul SOUL","id":"kindness-for-the-soul-soul","symbol":"soul","description":"Kindness For The Soul ($SOUL) is a decentralised deflationary asset, aiming to establish itself as the premier store of value in the cryptocurrency space. $SOUL distinguishes itself through various key elements. First and foremost, embracing decentralisation, and never listing on any centralised exchange. The $SOUL token is a deflationary asset, with a limited supply of 220,000 tokens. Every transaction, whether it involves buying, selling, or transferring, incurs a 7% burn which continually reduces the circulating supply. In contrast to other projects that gradually dilute their token supply and exploit their communities, $SOUL adopts a transparent approach. There are no team tokens, all existing tokens are already in circulation, and as the contract is renounced, no new supply will ever be created. We have an array of exciting initiatives in the pipeline for the future, join us to find out more.","links":"https://www.kindforthesoul.com","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kindness-for-the-soul-soul/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xdafc45a82c3681d857c6ae36227998190a9b6798"}}}
