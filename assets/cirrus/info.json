{"name":"Cirrus","id":"cirrus","symbol":"crs","description":"The Cirrus Token fuels the Stratis Smart Contract Sidechain . The CRS token acts as gas on the sidechain to fund smart contracts interaction . The CRS token is pegged to the Stratis Mainchain (STRAX) . The only way for CRS tokens to be issued is by locking STRAX tokens, this is achieved what is known as a cross chain transfer. This process is genuinely trustless and decentralized with the exchange being processed completely autonomously.","links":"https://www.stratisplatform.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cirrus/logo.png"}
