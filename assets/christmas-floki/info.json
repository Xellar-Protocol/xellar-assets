{"name":"Christmas Floki","id":"christmas-floki","symbol":"floc","description":"Christmas Floki (FLOC) is a meme cryptocurrency token operating on the BEP-20 Blockchain technology that was launched on November 21st, 2022. The project is created by the exact team behind Valentine Floki (FLOV) and Halloween Floki (FLOH), constituted of experienced programmers, cryptocurrency investors, and marketers who have a deep understanding and knowledge of the BSC DeFi space. The team designed a project based on definitive market rules and fundamental economic principles. Christmas Floki reconciles a high-performance protocol with integral price stability features. The smart contract has three taxes integrated in it: the rewards tax, the marketing tax and the liquidity pool tax. There is also an anti-whale mechanism programmed in the contract, preventing a single transaction above 0.5% of the total supply to be executed. The team has performed a KYC process prior to launching the project and its presale, which occurred on November 21st, 2022. The contract has undergone an audit with great results, increasing confidence and trust in the project for the current and future investors. Christmas Flokiâ€™s total supply accounts for 1 trillion FLOC, but the team made the decision to lock any extra tokens for the upcoming years.","links":"https://christmasfloki.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/christmas-floki/logo.png"}
