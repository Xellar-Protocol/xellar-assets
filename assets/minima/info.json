{"name":"Minima","id":"minima","symbol":"minima","description":"A Layer 1 PoW blockchain that can embed and run a full node on any device. Sovereignty is moving to the edge, where autonomous agents will learn, make decisions and transact on our behalf with limited oversight. Existing blockchains were not built for this future, forcing projects to: - Be optimistic (risky!), proofs are based on the assumption participants behave honestly - Charge extra for ZK. This is slow to generate, increases the computational cost significantly and is hard to scale - Do nothing at all. The lowest power devices simply cannot run cryptographic standards Minima is different. Minima has revolutionized Proof of Work to run at the edge. - Minima's nodes collaborate to construct & validate blocks - Minima utilizes a cascading chain manages blockchain growth by using Super Blocks - As well as an MMR database that stores only UTXOs relevant to that node’s private keys The result = a full node that utilizes just 300Mb with low computational cost.","links":"https://www.minima.global/","market_cap":11161435,"market_cap_rank":1498,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/minima/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
