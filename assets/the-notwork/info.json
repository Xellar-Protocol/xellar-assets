{"name":"The Notwork","id":"the-notwork","symbol":"notwork","description":"The Notwork is a community building businesses together for the benefit of the $NOTWORK token. Up to 90% of the revenue generated will go back to the community via buy backs and burns. The aim is to create a community token that does the working for you. We do this by distributing all business revenue back to holders via a buyback and burn. With the revenue we build a Solana stakepool to create a sustainable and everlasting deflationary mechanic.","links":"https://thenotwork.cc/","market_cap":50997,"market_cap_rank":8491,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/the-notwork/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"GcdLTfPGhdsX6zVjmcLchwwECzYqATHgk64sKZuadHKF","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/GcdLTfPGhdsX6zVjmcLchwwECzYqATHgk64sKZuadHKF"}}}
