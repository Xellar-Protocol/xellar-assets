{"name":"Dominium","id":"dominium-2","symbol":"dom","description":"\"Dominium is the first cryptocurrency backed by real world assets. Commercial units, Airbnbs, gold, miners, companies and more make up the Dominium basket of assets. The last century has shown that while currencies may evolve and change, real ownership is always king. He who owns the land, real estate, and commodities holds the real power. Over the coming decades, Dominium will continue to amass a treasury that not only is resistent to inflation and currency changes, but a treasury which also generates revenue. This revenue will pay out for decades. Over the first 24 months the DOM token will become deflationary, and all of the revenue generated for years to come will be used to buy and burn the DOM token. Citizens who participate in the Dominium staking \"\"School of Thought\"\" will have access to the passive income of real assets. Passive income that will provably pay out for decades. The DOM token can be used to purchase Dominium NFTs at a discount. These NFT allow access to Dominium properties and even housing and estate development opportunities. For example, those who hold the Marcus Aurelius NFTs will have penthouse access to our apartment buildings. The DOM token represents absolute ownership and a new wave of off-chain/on-chain integrations for a better IRL world.\"","links":"https://dominium.finance/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dominium-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x0e2c818fea38e7df50410f772b7d59af20589a62","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/polygon_pos/tokens/0x0e2c818fea38e7df50410f772b7d59af20589a62"}}}
