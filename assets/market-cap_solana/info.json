{"name":"Market Cap","id":"market-cap_solana","symbol":"mcap","description":"Market Cap is a digital project centered around the creation and distribution of market-themed virtual collectibles, with its primary symbol being a blue cap featuring the letter \"M.\" The project is built on the idea of representing, in a symbolic and playful way, the culture and language of the crypto and financial ecosystem through simple yet meaningful digital objects. Rather than promising returns or offering complex financial products, Market Cap focuses on a conceptual approach: delivering a digital piece that visually represents the idea of a \"market cap\" — a term commonly used in financial analysis and cryptocurrency trading. Market Cap is not an investment platform, DeFi protocol, or a token with advanced technical utility. Its focus is purely symbolic and cultural. The digital cap acts as a form of expression within crypto communities, where terms like “market cap,” “capitulation,” or “putting on the cap” are part of the everyday jargon. In this way, the project positions itself as a visual icon within the collective imagination of the blockchain world, with a clear and recognizable identity that can be reused as an NFT, PFP (profile picture), or accessory in metaverse platforms depending on future integrations.","links":"https://themarketingisinthemcap.com/","market_cap":5968.82,"market_cap_rank":12105,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/market-cap_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"HTJjDuxxnxHGoKTiTYLMFQ59gFjSBS3bXiCWJML6bonk","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/HTJjDuxxnxHGoKTiTYLMFQ59gFjSBS3bXiCWJML6bonk"}},"is_native":false}
