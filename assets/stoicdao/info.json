{"name":"stoicDAO","id":"stoicdao","symbol":"zeta","description":"StoicDAO, also known as ZETA, stands as a pioneering project within the rapidly evolving landscape of blockchain-based ventures. This innovative initiative combines the transformative potential of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) with the organizational structure of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), focusing on a members-only investment ecosystem. One of its most ambitious endeavors is the development of a top-tier, AAA-rated Player-to-Earn (P2E) game with a battle royale-style gameplay. The foundation of StoicDAO lies in the utilization of NFTs, unique digital assets authenticated through blockchain technology, which grant ownership and rarity to individual holders. By integrating these NFTs into the DAO structure, StoicDAO empowers its members to participate actively in investment decisions within the ecosystem, fostering a community-driven approach to project development and growth.","links":"https://stoicdao.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/stoicdao/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb281d84989c06e2a6ccdc5ea7bf1663c79a1c31a"}}}
