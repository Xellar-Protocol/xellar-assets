{"name":"Jaypeggers USDC","id":"jaypeggers-usdc","symbol":"jusdc","description":"Jaypeggers is a tax-loss harvesting solution for NFTs. Jaypeggers enables users to secure tax savings by harvesting NFT losses, earn platform rewards and hunt for arbitrage. The main ecosystem token is JAY, which is backed by Ethereum and generates yield via platform fees. The ecosystem will support JAY variants that employ a similar model but with different token backings. The first variant to be introduced to the ecosystem is jUSDCâ€”backed by USDC instead of Ethereum to minimize downside potential while still providing yield-bearing opportunities.","links":"https://jaypeggers.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/jaypeggers-usdc/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xca9f9671765f8d1a7e19ae2639e01fff730f0d9b"}}}
