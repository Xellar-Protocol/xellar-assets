{"name":"f(x) Protocol Fractional ETH","id":"f-x-protocol-fractional-eth","symbol":"feth","description":"What is the project about? f(x) splits ETH into a mix of low-volatility “floating stablecoins” called fETH and high-volatility “leveraged ETH” tokens called xETH. Users can supply ETH or stETH to mint either one (pure ETH is zapped into stETH before deposit) What makes your project unique? f(x) was created to avoid centralized risks from real-world assets. Apart from smart contract and oracle risk, which are common to nearly all DeFi protocols, the main risk for f(x) is of an extreme outlier rapid ETH price drop which is larger than the ability of the currently minted xETH to absorb. In that case, xETH price would go to zero (sort of like a liquidation) and fETH would lose its low volatility nature, reverting to 1:1 ETH price movements. What can your token be used for? fETH can be used like a stablecoin. It’s decentralized (backed only by stETH) so it avoids exposure to the shenanigans of central banks or other IRL entities. fETH isn’t exactly a stablecoin, because it gains and loses a small amount of value as ETH rises and falls. Those price movements are fixed at 10% of the size of ETH’s. In this way, it’s anchored to the Ethereum economy, rather than the US one. If you think that USD will devalue over time compared to ETH, you might like to hold it instead of USD stablecoins.","links":"https://fx.aladdin.club/home/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/f-x-protocol-fractional-eth/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x53805a76e1f5ebbfe7115f16f9c87c2f7e633726"}}}
