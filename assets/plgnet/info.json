{"name":"PL^Gnet","id":"plgnet","symbol":"plug","description":"PL^Gnet enables creation of synthetic assets from multiple chains, which can leverage DeFi in one network, using a simple UX from your existing trusted provider. PL^Gnet aims to solve the problems identified by: • Introducing a new solution to enable deeper liquidity pools for assets from different chains • Leveraging existing compliance onboarding processes to create shareable attestations, in order to enhance compliance in DeFi for developers and traditional finance providers • Reduce complexity for assets to exist in the same smart contract network while enhancing existing multi-chain approaches. • Provide a safer environment for new users to access DeFi products (such as borrowing and lending platforms and derivatives exchanges) without taking on the risks of self-custody • Enable exchanges, staking providers and custodians to offer DeFi connectivity and leverage assets “at rest” in a novel way","links":"https://plugdefi.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/plgnet/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x47da5456bc2e1ce391b645ce80f2e97192e4976a"}}}
