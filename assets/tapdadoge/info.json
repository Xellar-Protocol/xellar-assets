{"name":"TapDaDoge","id":"tapdadoge","symbol":"run","description":"TapDaDoge is an interactive tap-to-earn game hosted on Telegram, inspired by the popular Chrome Dino game, known for its massive player base of 270 million monthly users. Built on the Binance Smart Chain blockchain technology, TapDaDoge offers players an entertaining and rewarding gaming experience infused with meme-inspired elements. Setting itself apart as the pioneering BSC initiative, TapDaDoge is dedicated to promoting sustainability through innovative in-game tax and deflationary models. These features are seamlessly integrated to enhance user experience by emphasizing simplicity and efficiency, ultimately minimizing time commitments for players. TapDaDoge’s main attraction is our diverse cast of NFT characters. They are not simply static images on a screen. The players controls them to jump over obstacles in the game, and, as they get better, their earning potential also increases. The game is a simple exercise of hand-eye coordination, making it more approachable and eliminating the frustrations of learning a new game. Furthermore, our team is constantly at work to bring new features to the game (e.g. cosmetic items, environments, boosters.), ensuring TapDaDoge’s quality and longevity.","links":"https://tapdadoge.app/","market_cap":3341.41,"market_cap_rank":11512,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/tapdadoge/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8f85f63b76d2c40c7cf3dac19637730d00d37966","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x8f85f63b76d2c40c7cf3dac19637730d00d37966"}}}
