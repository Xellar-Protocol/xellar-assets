{"name":"Shady Labs","id":"shady-labs_solana","symbol":"shady","description":"Shady Labs is a privacy infrastructure built on Solana that enables fully private, unlinkable transactions through stealth addresses. Each transfer automatically generates a one-time wallet address, allowing users to receive crypto without revealing their real wallet or identity. All data is encrypted locally and published on-chain in unreadable form, detectable only by the receiver using their private view key. This ensures complete confidentiality between sender and receiver while maintaining blockchain transparency and security.","links":"https://shady.to/","market_cap":4223.35,"market_cap_rank":12579,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/shady-labs/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"6WEsL1dvUQbTwjtMvKvZZKqv4GwG6b9qfCQSsa4Bpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/6WEsL1dvUQbTwjtMvKvZZKqv4GwG6b9qfCQSsa4Bpump"}},"is_native":false}
