{"name":"SMART BLOCKCHAIN","id":"smart-blockchain","symbol":"smart","description":"\"Description: Smart (SMART) is the parent coin of the Smart Blockchain network. Smart Blockchain is an easily scalable blockchain solution that uses innovative techniques to solve problems associated with traditional blockchain networks. The Smart Blockchain consensus mechanism uses an innovative DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) system. The blockchain model is based on the Google Protobuf (Protocol Buffers) system, which allows you to quickly create decentralized networks and your tokens and integrate them into existing products. The Smart Blockchain network is distinguished by high throughput - up to 2,000 transactions per second, low dynamic commissions, and the speed of creating a new block - an average of 3 seconds. Moreover, the project has a multifunctional crypto wallet â€“ SMART Wallet, which supports the most popular digital currencies, including SMART. Smart Blockchain was launched in 2023 by an experienced team of blockchain specialists tasked with solving the problems of fast scalability, transaction speed, and security. The project continues its steady development and has attracted hundreds of thousands of crypto enthusiasts worldwide. Mission: Smart Blockchain is a project designed to solve the problems of the crypto market, ensure the most stable operation of the decentralized network, and simplify its scalability. \"","links":"https://smartblockchain.com/en/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/smart-blockchain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
