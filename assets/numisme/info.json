{"name":"NumisMe","id":"numisme","symbol":"nume","description":"NumisMe and the NUME token uniquely allows customers to convert their change after making a physical cash purchase, into digital money. By building partnerships with retail businesses and big box stores, Numisme intends to add value to everyday POS systems by providing vendors the ability to accept cash payments, but without having to return any physical change. Pay with cash, and get the change (as much as you want) back into your NumisMe wallet. From there you can keep it in fiat, send it peer to peer, or have the change sent directly to a bank account of your choosing. You can also use the change to buy NUME, in which you can either hold, stake or swap for other crypto, making your change work for you as an investment. The NUME token features reflections to reward token holders. NumisMe has been issued a patent from the US Patent Office to protect the technology from being copied by others.","links":"https://numisme.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/numisme/logo.png"}
