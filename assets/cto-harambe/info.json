His death sparked widespread debate and quickly turned him into an internet icon, symbolizing everything from animal rights to online absurdity. Harambe , a novel meme-inspired cryptocurrency, has emerged as a vibrant addition to the decentralized landscape on the ETH blockchain. Born out of the internet's love for memes and a desire for community-driven projects, Harambe Coin pays homage to the legendary gorilla whose spirit captivated the world.","links":"https://dicksout4harambe.com/","market_cap":197697,"market_cap_rank":5489,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cto-harambe/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x244f09d92971d03a779aa66d310579a6517ab9a4"}}}
