{"name":"Kensetsu Token","id":"kensetsu-token","symbol":"ken","description":"KEN is a farming reward token meant to incentivize liquidity for KENSETSU stablecoins. For each stablecoin minted from deposited collateral, 1% extra of the stablecoin will be minted and used to buy back and burn KEN tokens. 80% of the burned KEN tokens will be reminted and distributed to Demeter farm for farming rewards on the XOR-KUSD pool on Polkaswap. With KENSETSU, XOR token holders can vote to create stablecoins pegged to any values available via oracles on the SORA network, such as popular fiat currencies, GOLD, SILVER, and others","links":"https://sora.org/","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kensetsu-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":null}}}
