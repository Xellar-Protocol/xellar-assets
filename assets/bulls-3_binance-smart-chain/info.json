{"name":"Bulls","id":"bulls-3_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"bulls","description":"The Bull Society is a prominent NFT collection and token ecosystem built on the BNB Chain, recognized for its strong community engagement and meme culture. Launched as the Binance Bull Society with 7,777 hand-drawn bull NFTs, it quickly became a flagship community project, rebranding after a Binance request. Its NFTs were one of the first listed on the Binance NFT Marketplace, with Trust Wallet calling it the “Bored Apes of BSC”. The $BULLS token is strategically integrated to create real demand by allocating a portion of supply for buybacks of Bull Society NFTs from secondary marketplaces such as RareBoard, providing continual liquidity and rewarding long-term holders. The project represents the bold spirit and relentless energy of meme traders and builders on BNB Chain, supporting an interconnected ecosystem that champions OG meme culture, NFT rewards, and bullish market participation for users and creators alike.","links":"https://www.thebullsoc.fun","market_cap":46935,"market_cap_rank":8305,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bulls-3/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x78525f54e46d2821ec59bfae27201058881b4444","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x78525f54e46d2821ec59bfae27201058881b4444"}},"is_native":false}
