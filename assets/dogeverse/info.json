{"name":"DogeVerse","id":"dogeverse","symbol":"dogeverse","description":"DogeVerse is a multi-chain Doge memecoin, centered around the narrative of Cosmo, the chain-traveling Doge. The $DOGEVERSE token was launched through an ICO in Q2 2024, successfully reaching its $17 million hard cap. The DogeVerse community could purchase and claim $DOGEVERSE tokens across six different chains: ETH, BNB, POLY, BASE, SOL, and AVAX. The native base token was first deployed on Ethereum, and then Wormholeâ€™s Portal Bridge technology was used to create tokens on the other chains. DogeVerse is tradable on various decentralized exchanges (DEX) with liquidity pools established on all supported chains.","links":"https://thedogeverse.com/en","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dogeverse/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x62f03b52c377fea3eb71d451a95ad86c818755d1"},"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x38022a157b95c52d43abcac9bd09f028a1079105"},"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"7xZCdhj7rGhnKndRpU3NHgZhbFMkPLP2ErDr1AS8Chsx"},"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x004aa1586011f3454f487eac8d0d5c647d646c69"},"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc6c58f600917de512cd02d2b6ed595ab54b4c30f"}}}
