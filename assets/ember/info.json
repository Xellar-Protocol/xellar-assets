{"name":"Ember","id":"ember","symbol":"ember","description":"The Ember Token is a product of Ember Agency, LLC and was developed to empower new and recovering projects in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space while bringing aggressive reflections and rewards to our holders. Our tokenomics are simple and include a percentage of buy/sell transactions that go towards a recovery investment wallet. The recovery wallet is used to bring support to new, struggling, or rugged projects in DeFi and strategically aligns with our agency services to help build the strongest brands in crypto. Additionally, Ember Token is structured to be a bridge between crypto and real-world experiences through reward fuelled NFTs. Through our [first-of-its-kind] “Consultinomics,” Ember Agency also contributes 25% of our corporate consulting revenue back into our token through buybacks and reward pool contributions for loyal holders. Ember Token is also fully verified on BSCScan.","links":"https://embertoken.io/","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ember/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x36a8fcb1f8bca02dc74eb34281de3b9143eae8e3"}}}
