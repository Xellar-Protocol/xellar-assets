{"name":"NeuroCheck","id":"neurocheck","symbol":"neuro","description":"NeuroCheck is an AI-powered browser extension and tool designed to detect AI-generated content in real time across social platforms and websites. Its primary utility is protecting users from deceptive media—such as deepfakes, AI-generated threads, and misleading content—especially in environments like crypto trading where misinformation can lead to financial loss. Users are alerted instantly when interacting with suspicious or AI-generated content, helping them avoid scams and potential rug pulls. We currently offer an image upload detection tool on our website (neurocheck.io), and our Chrome extension is pending approval on the Chrome Web Store. NeuroCheck is building a safer internet by making AI detection as instant as AI creation.","links":"https://www.neurocheck.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/neurocheck/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"DoHf7hNLXSH22magnKwL81iVwpVjUZhpX65tDYZbsBLV","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/DoHf7hNLXSH22magnKwL81iVwpVjUZhpX65tDYZbsBLV"}}}
