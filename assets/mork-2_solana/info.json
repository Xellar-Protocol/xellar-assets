{"name":"MORK","id":"mork-2_solana","symbol":"mork","description":"Mork is a meme coin powered by a chaotic green cartoon dog with questionable morals, unhinged energy, and a disturbingly accurate grasp of blockchain fundamentals. Born on the Solana network—where speed reigns, fees are nearly nonexistent, and absurdity is basically protocol—Mork skips the empty promises of utility-packed roadmaps and instead delivers pure, community-fueled anarchy. It thrives on viral momentum, meme magic, and the collective madness of a decentralized crowd that’s in on the joke—but still wondering if the joke is sentient. Whether it’s trending on Twitter, infiltrating Telegram threads, or getting tattooed on someone’s leg in a questionable life decision, Mork lives rent-free in the minds of degens and normies alike. It’s not just a coin—it’s a cultural glitch, a lovable menace, and somehow, despite all logic, it works.","links":"https://morkcoin.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mork-2_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"ATo5zfoTpUSa2PqNCn54uGD5UDCBtc5QT2Svqm283XcH","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/ATo5zfoTpUSa2PqNCn54uGD5UDCBtc5QT2Svqm283XcH"}},"is_native":false}
