My Tokenomics – Making Longevity Rewarding $NML: The Core of My Ecosystem - Token Name: $NML - Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 $NML tokens Emissions & Rewards - Instead of a fixed emission schedule, rewards are dynamically adjusted based on engagement—transaction volume, active users, and community participation. - The most interactive pools receive prioritised rewards, ensuring an equitable distribution and preventing liquidity centralisation. Sustainable Liquidity Model - Users who commit liquidity for extended periods receive amplified rewards. - Active participation within my ecosystem, whether through engagement or contributions, results in additional incentives. Performance-Based Revenue & Burn Model - Every transaction fee generated through my ecosystem contributes to a buyback and burn mechanism. - A proportion of fees from user interactions, premium features, and trading will be used to repurchase $NML tokens, which will then be permanently removed from circulation. - Emissions will be distributed back to engaged token holders, ensuring long-term participants benefit as the ecosystem expands. The Long-Term Vision I’m here to make health and longevity both accessible and rewarding. By ensuring that every interaction within my ecosystem contributes to a healthier and more sustainable token economy, I aim to build an AI-driven wellness platform that benefits users and contributors alike. So, if you’re ready to take control of your health, let’s get started. I’m here for the long haul—literally!","links":"https://life.netmind.ai/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/zoey-your-longevity-coach-by-netmind-xyz/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc6c4575dc40ac63a5f89b5c4ae0b3a9134c52c4c","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xc6c4575dc40ac63a5f89b5c4ae0b3a9134c52c4c"}}}
