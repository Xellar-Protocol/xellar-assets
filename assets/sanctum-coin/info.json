{"name":"Sanctum Coin","id":"sanctum-coin","symbol":"sancta","description":"What is the project about? Sanctum is a play-to-earn game on Arbitrum, which incorporates RPG & strategy elements to create a unique game tailor-made for GameFi. Through a combination of a gamified Discord server& our web app, players will delve into Sanctum’s rich lore - forming guilds, managing a roster of Adventurers (called Pawns), and engaging in turn-based combat What makes your project unique? Sanctum is taking a new approach to defi games, making sure to build a fun game from the ground up with defi in mind. It isn't just copy-pasting some old game into defi, with minimal effort. The first priority is for the game to be fun, and the mechanics tailored specifically to fit crypto. History of your project. Sanctum started as an idea in late 2021 shortly after which it started development. After over a year it's time to start deploying it and implementing the economic and game-play systems that were designed for it. What’s next for your project? The next major step is going from the alpha version of the game to 1.0, after which there is a packed roadmap of features and game modes in line. What can your token be used for? The token is the base of the entire game, everything in the ecosystem is tied to it, from the marketplace to crafting or betting. Later on it will also be used as a governance token.","links":"https://sanctum.community","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/sanctum-coin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x810cf1757b51963102e0b4fe9fdfcdf749dea98a"}}}
