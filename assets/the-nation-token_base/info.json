{"name":"The Nation Token","id":"the-nation-token_base","symbol":"nato","description":"The Nation Token (NATO) represents a groundbreaking experiment in global financial cooperation and decentralization. Our vision is to create a token entirely owned and managed by the global community, devoid of centralized control or team ownership. NATO will be launched on the Base Network to ensure security, scalability, and accessibility for all participants. The ultimate goal of NATO is to empower people worldwide to collaborate and potentially create value through collective action. We will challenge the public to see if the token can reach a value of $0.01 per NATO, driven solely by community activity and engagement. 1. Decentralized Ownership: NATO is designed to be fully decentralized, with no central authority or team controlling its distribution, allocation, or use. 2. Community Experiment: The project challenges the global community to collaborate and organically build value, aiming for the token to reach $0.01 per NATO. 3. Transparency and Trust: By launching on the Base Network and providing open-source smart contracts, we ensure complete transparency in the token's creation and distribution. 4. Empowerment: NATO seeks to empower individuals globally to participate in and influence a decentralized financial ecosystem.","links":"https://thenationtoken.com/","market_cap":940732,"market_cap_rank":3815,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/the-nation-token_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd968196fa6977c4e58f2af5ac01c655ea8332d22","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xd968196fa6977c4e58f2af5ac01c655ea8332d22"}},"is_native":false}
