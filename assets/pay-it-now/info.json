{"name":"Pay It Now","id":"pay-it-now","symbol":"pin","description":"PIN was developed with the goals in mind to reward both website owners, retail outlets, and their users, by allowing easy seamless website payment methods, loyalty points, and rewards that benefit not just the owners, but the whole community. PIN is a new decentralized cryptocurrency, allowing website users and retail customers to earn crypto by posting content or interacting with certain websites or retail stores that utilize PIN’s unique payment, loyalty, or reward systems to reward their users in an exciting new way, and to allow for easy seamless transactional methods for users to buy subscriptions, website transactions, and in-store loyalty points. PIN gives website owners and retail stores this unique way to reward their users which will set them a level above their competitor's sites and stores, bringing in thousands of new users and customers who want to earn crypto instead of receiving the traditional rewards or points that only offer status or goods, instead of hard-earned crypto for their time. With PIN’s unique tokenomics which allow users to earn free tokens on partner websites and retail stores, a portion of the transaction fees is automatically redistributed to an owner’s pool to regenerate and supply PIN to website owners and retail stores at no cost. A portion of the transaction fees is also redistributed to reward our holders of PIN for their loyalty by way of automatic reflections.","links":"https://payitnow.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pay-it-now/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x5e8f6244a57f4f6c47daafc14aa0723d2a9f594c"}}}
