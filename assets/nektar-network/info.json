{"name":"Nektar Network","id":"nektar-network","symbol":"net","description":"Nektar is a Liquidity & Infrastructure Marketplace that aggregates liquidity by connecting Delegators to Networks through a Decentralized Asset Manager (DAM). DAMs also enable Operators to manage infrastructure operation for the benefit of Networks. Nearly any participant in the modular decentralized economy can use Nektar to distribute rewards or source compute power without relinquishing token control or altering incentive mechanics. Nektar aims to match infrastructure and liquidity needs of: - Operators: maximize capital efficiency of existing infrastructure by accessing top revenue-generating opportunities. - Networks: incentivize liquidity, attract new operators, boost loyalty of existing ones. - Delegators: increase potential rewards from their assets by depositing a wide array of tokens. - Managers: are responsible for creating and running DAMs.","links":"https://nektar.network/","market_cap":3365841,"market_cap_rank":2739,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nektar-network/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6e6b7adfc7db9feeb8896418ac3422966f65d0a5"}}}
