{"name":"Ethereans","id":"ethereans","symbol":"os","description":"The Ethereans Operating System—is an operating system for Ethereum, comprising three integrated protocols. The first is a platform for on-chain organizations, which are like DAOs, but more sophisticated and decentralized. The second is a platform for the Item token standard, which is like the evolution of the ERC1155 standard. The third is Covenants, a suite of DeFi applications built on top of the first ever on-chain AMM Aggregator. This is the first ever completely on-chain, general-purpose platform for all governance, development and applications on Ethereum—a bona fide OS. Use it for anything—even if just as a base layer to code on the network.","links":"https://ethereans.app/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ethereans/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6100dd79fcaa88420750dcee3f735d168abcb771"}}}
