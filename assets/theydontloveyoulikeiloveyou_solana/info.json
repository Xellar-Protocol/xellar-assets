{"name":"theydontloveyoulikeiloveyou","id":"theydontloveyoulikeiloveyou_solana","symbol":"wait","description":"Theydontloveyoulikeiloveyou (ticker: WAIT) is a memecoin inspired by the viral TikTok trend from September 2024, set to the iconic lyrics \"Wait, They Don't Love You Like I Love You\" from Maps by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. The trend featured two popular dances: one by TikToker @southernbellesuzie, with a bouncy, finger-pointing groove, and another by @user_18373563848, which combined hip-shaking moves with a playful \"stop\" hand gesture. WAIT captures the energy and fun of this viral moment, turning it into a token for fans of internet culture, memes, and nostalgia. It’s designed as a lighthearted way to celebrate this unique cultural flashpoint rather than as a utility-driven cryptocurrency. The token focuses on building a community of people who love connecting over shared memories and viral trends.","market_cap":25099,"market_cap_rank":9345,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/theydontloveyoulikeiloveyou/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"CbUPTbC4K7zdAEWxfa1nad4468xpX3LpWPhZVnzybhfN","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/CbUPTbC4K7zdAEWxfa1nad4468xpX3LpWPhZVnzybhfN"}},"is_native":false}
