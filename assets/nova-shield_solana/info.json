Built initially for macOS, Nova Shield leverages large language models to monitor system activity, detect anomalies, and respond in real time through shell-level access. Its purpose is to close the multi-billion-dollar gap caused by undetected malware targeting digital assets, particularly crypto wallets. The platform provides simple installation, real-time defense, and an AI companion that executes commands, scans files, and prevents malicious activity without requiring users to be technical experts.","links":"https://nshield.org","market_cap":98032,"market_cap_rank":7040,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nova-shield_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"3SkFJRqMPTKZLqKK1MmY2mvAm711FGAtJ9ZbL6r1coin","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/3SkFJRqMPTKZLqKK1MmY2mvAm711FGAtJ9ZbL6r1coin"}},"is_native":false}
