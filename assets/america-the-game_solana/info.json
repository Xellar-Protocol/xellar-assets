Built on Solana, $US fuels gameplay, character interactions, and community events tied to a 4,547-piece NFT cast of “Americans.” The token has quickly grown into a culture-heavy community hub where players, collectors, and meme enjoyers unite to vote, compete, and shape each new season’s storyline. Blending humor, strategy, and Web3 participation, $US celebrates the absurdity of politics in a playful, community-powered way.","links":"https://america.game","market_cap":97144,"market_cap_rank":7045,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/america-the-game/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"Hxai4E6xQdtQJXZJTfs67mdFGfF22y78ut9heLHpqUSA","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/Hxai4E6xQdtQJXZJTfs67mdFGfF22y78ut9heLHpqUSA"}},"is_native":false}
