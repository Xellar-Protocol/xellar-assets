{"name":"GuaridOS","id":"guaridos_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"gudos","description":"GuaridOS is a Web3 security and productivity suite built on top of Flux’s decentralized infrastructure. It combines encrypted communication, storage, identity, and financial tools into one unified platform. Users can access features such as secure mail, decentralized drive, calendar, authenticator, VPN, vault, password manager, payments, and chat — all designed with privacy and resilience in mind. By leveraging Flux nodes for compute and storage, GuaridOS eliminates reliance on centralized servers and reduces single points of failure. The project’s goal is to provide a censorship-resistant and privacy-first alternative to traditional digital services, giving individuals and organizations more control over their data and digital identity.","links":"https://guaridos.me/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/guaridos_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xeeaa9a247c16d29d5ab4bcd9ab2640920562790f","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xeeaa9a247c16d29d5ab4bcd9ab2640920562790f"}},"is_native":false}
