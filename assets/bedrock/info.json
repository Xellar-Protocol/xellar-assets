Users are able to: 1) Swap tokens 2) Earn Rock tokens by providing liquidity and staking 3) Create or Join a Peer to Peer Experiment Bedrock's Social Experiments provide value because they give approved borrowers a means to quickly and easily access BUSD for their experiment. Borrowers must provide collateral in Rock to start an experiment. Users will have the opportunity to join new experiments as experiments are created. Users will be rewarded interest in BUSD as a reward for joining experiments. Borrowers must pay back the original BUSD amount before the end of the terms to make another experiment. After completion of the smart contract, Borrowers will receive a score ranking to show the total number of completed experiments. This will allow users more confidence in joining future smart contract experiments.","links":"https://bedrockswap.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bedrock/logo.png"}
