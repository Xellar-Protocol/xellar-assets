{"name":"Seedling","id":"seedling","symbol":"sdln","description":"Seedling is a platform for retail venture investing in equity and tokens. Most retail investors cannot afford to risk large portions of their money. Seedling aims to provide a low risk participation framework to reach global retail in venture capital. By providing an opportunity to everyday people to safely grow their own capital, we aim to promote individual financial independence while simultaneously enabling a new early stage funding source for innovation worldwide. We have created a platform that incorporates pluggable solutions to the problems early stage ventures face after fundraising, alongside creating venture investment structures that make participation far safer for retail.","links":"https://www.seedling.cm/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/seedling/logo.png"}
