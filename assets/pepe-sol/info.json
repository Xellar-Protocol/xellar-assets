In a way it is, it uses the same image but its on a completely different chain. Also having it on sol makes the barrier to entry a bit lower for newer folks trying to get in. The community seems to have a second wind here a wants to run with this one, multiple people are creating websites and other tools to add to the ecosystem. This is not a case of which one is better more less some crypto heads mashing their creative skills together and this is the result.","links":"","market_cap":2689826,"market_cap_rank":2095,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pepe-sol/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"B5WTLaRwaUQpKk7ir1wniNB6m5o8GgMrimhKMYan2R6B"}}}
