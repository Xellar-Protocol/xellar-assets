{"name":"SCARCITY","id":"scarcity-2","symbol":"scarcity","description":"SCARCITY is a DESOC, or decentralized social media platform. It was designed and developed to solve the problems inherent in existing centralized social applications and media by creating a social media without a centralized entity. The benefit of decentralized social media lies in the problems of existing centralized services. Centralized entities like Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, etc. control most of the revenue, information, and advertising. Decentralized social media services put the data and revenue in the hands of the users and put them in charge of solving problems.","links":"https://www.scarcity.company/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/scarcity-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0d67d1bec77e562a73a65eef5ed92ac46744671c"}}}
