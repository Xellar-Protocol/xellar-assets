{"name":"AXIOMA TOKEN","id":"axioma-token_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"axt","description":"The AXIOMA Token (AXT) is the core utility asset for the FFSRO (Financial Freedom SRO) digital ecosystem, which operates on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The project's purpose is to create a secure, self-sustaining economy by merging digital utility with real-world asset value. Function and Utility: AXT serves as the exclusive payment token required to access all services within the FFSRO dashboard. These services include a suite of AI-powered business solutions, social media growth campaigns, and a peer-to-peer customer lead generation hub (the 'Ask Community'). This mechanism is engineered to drive constant transactional demand for AXT. Asset Structure: FFSRO's long-term vision is anchored by the Axioma Eagle City initiative, which is a project to tokenize real estate assets worth over EUR 835 million. This asset backing provides stability and attracts institutional investment. Security and Management: The project is governed by the FFSRO legal entity and developed entirely in-house by the Chief Technology Officer to ensure complete source code security, eliminate third-party risk, and guarantee the platform's long-term stability. The smart contract has a fixed total supply and includes internal dividend mechanisms to reward long-term holders.","links":"https://ffsro.com","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/axioma-token_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xbb6b75ad7ab30a172e7b5ce46ef2fcf299d14219","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xbb6b75ad7ab30a172e7b5ce46ef2fcf299d14219"}},"is_native":false}
