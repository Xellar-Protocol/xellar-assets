{"name":"Shoulda Bought More","id":"shoulda-bought-more_solana","symbol":"more","description":"More is a meme coin that plays on the universal feeling of 'I should’ve bought more', the regret that often strikes when people look at the price chart of a token they were underexposed to. The token captures this sense of missed opportunity, becoming a symbol for those who feel they didn’t invest enough when the market was at a favorable price. More resonates with investors who have experienced the frustration of seeing a token’s value rise after they missed the chance to buy in earlier.","links":"https://www.shouldaboughtmore.fun/","market_cap":7276.51,"market_cap_rank":11775,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/shoulda-bought-more/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"AEDEBKCEkxHvFx69vKD8EmZ7VqmhAqobubfgMt32pump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/AEDEBKCEkxHvFx69vKD8EmZ7VqmhAqobubfgMt32pump"}},"is_native":false}
