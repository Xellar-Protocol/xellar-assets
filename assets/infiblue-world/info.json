{"name":"Infiblue World","id":"infiblue-world","symbol":"monie","description":"What is the project about? Infiblue World, a real-world simulation blockchain game, where players earn income through gameplay and social networking. Our mission is to build a sustainable blockchain Metaverse that benefits everyone financially. What makes your project unique? Infiblue World runs on a real map and simulates real-world economic and social activities. Players can buy and build virtual land, run businesses on it, find jobs, and meet other players. Inspired by many great games such as Sims and Upland, Infiblue World offers the best experience to 2 groups of users: a fun world that allows players to start with nothing and make money by finding a job, as well as an exciting opportunity that some players can build their business. History of your project. We started this project back in March 2021. Our team is located in Bay Area San Francisco USA. We currently have Morgan Stanley as our biggest backer. The game demo is available on our website. We currently have 130,190 registered players and 21700 token holders. What’s next for your project? We are planning to launch our in-game social app in August 2023. Our game public testing will be launched in October 2023 together with our NFT sale. What can your token be used for? Monie is the main Infiblue token. It is a governance token for community governance, voting, and purchasing NFT assets.","links":"https://infiblue.world/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/infiblue-world/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x7e60c74b9096f8fa6fb5a9fd88405ded8b7d44f3","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x7e60c74b9096f8fa6fb5a9fd88405ded8b7d44f3"}}}
