{"name":"ClaimSwap","id":"claimswap","symbol":"cla","description":"ClaimSwap is a Klaytn DEX based on AMM(Automated Market Maker). KLAYswap, which already provides a similar service, has contributed to expanding the Klaytn Defi ecosystem. However, no other DEX had matured in the ecosystem, leaving users with limited options. The ClaimSwap team aims to provide a more user-friendly protocol. Just as the Uniswap-Sushiswap case, we look forward to boosting the overall ecosystem with the release of ClaimSwap.","links":"https://claimswap.org/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/claimswap/logo.png","detail_platform":{"klay-token":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xcf87f94fd8f6b6f0b479771f10df672f99eada63"}}}
