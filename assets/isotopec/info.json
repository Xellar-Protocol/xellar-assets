{"name":"IsotopeC","id":"isotopec","symbol":"iso","description":"The main consensus for IsotopeC, is to assure that special hashing systems (ASIC/FPGA/GPU's) are challenged by the algorithm implemented through periodic algorithmic change from time to time. This is to attain the ability for mining only by CPU's for its consensus, market fairness and power efficiency. Its purpose is to establish a private trust-less payment system and the ability to send payments instantly to anyone in the world, without any central authority for its users. Every transaction written to the ledger is public and is fully visible in the IsotopeC blockchain. IsotopeC is strictly a grassroots asset with no ICO. It was fairly launched with no business structure and its miner consensus determines its direction. There was no pre-mine and there will never be any airdrops, or faucets. It was designed to be free from tyranny, and will be the bastion of crypto freedom.","links":"https://isotopec.org/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/isotopec/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
