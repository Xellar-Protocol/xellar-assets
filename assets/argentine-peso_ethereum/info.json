{"name":"Argentine Peso","id":"argentine-peso_ethereum","symbol":"wars","description":"wARS is a fully collateralized stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the Argentine Peso (ARS). Issued and governed by a Ripio subsidiary, it brings ARS on-chain so Argentines and global users can transact, save, and build on decentralized networks in their local currency. Backed by Ripio’s since-2013 track record in LATAM, wARS enables FX and remittances, DeFi lending and yields, merchant QR payments, and seamless on/off-ramps without leaving the ARS unit of account.","links":"https://www.ripio.com/es/criptos/stablecoins-locales","market_cap":189478,"market_cap_rank":5991,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/argentine-peso/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0dc4f92879b7670e5f4e4e6e3c801d229129d90d","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x0dc4f92879b7670e5f4e4e6e3c801d229129d90d"}},"is_native":false}
