{"name":"Wagyu Protocol","id":"wagyu-protocol","symbol":"wagyu","description":"In the current age of cryptocurrency, snipers rule the blockchain. With so many options available to the public, it is clear that automatic sniping is here to stay. With this in mind, we as developers and teams must increase the efficiency of our contracts and deployments in order to execute a truly fair launch. Key in these improvements then becomes deployment speed, as each moment that passes between contract deployment and active trading is time for an additional sniper to setup their bot to dump on the chart and the community. Many of the current top trending tokens charts would have held initial floors up to 5x higher (if not more) had these liquidity extractors been eliminated and their tokens were instead in the hands of real people. In 2024 De-Fi, speed and efficiency are no longer luxuries, they are necessities. Summary In short, WAGYU provides teams with access to Instant Launches that put emphasis on speed and provide access to Priority Purchasing. As we said above, each moment from contract deployment to active trading is time for another sniper to setup their bot, but what if there was no time between these events? Instant Launches - The WAGYU Launcher leverages the effects of bundling and bribes to execute Deployment, Initialization, Liquidity, and Trading in one transaction, guaranteed. Some snipers may still be able to execute on the contract, but they will be flying blind and will be easy to spot for the development teams using WAGYU. Step-by-Step Launches - However, for those looking to leverage early snipers for activity and trending volume, WAGYU also has the ability to toggle any of our automatic launch features off before deployment. All functions provided by WAGYU have the option to be manually called at a later time with a single push of a button, ensuring that our bot can meet any of your launching needs. Priority Purchasing (Snipers) - WAGYU Launches also come equipped with what we call our Priority Purchasing feature, ie. built-in snipe","links":"https://wagyuprotocol.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wagyu-protocol/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf76c15cbf1fa9d60a7af39e660d6d7c62ef8021e"}}}
