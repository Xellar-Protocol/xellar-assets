{"name":"Jose","id":"jose","symbol":"jose","description":"Jose Coin stands out as a distinctive meme coin by eschewing the common, unsustainable model of multi-trillion and billion token supplies that many others adopt. Instead, it was carefully designed with the achievable ambition of reaching a value of $1 and potentially surpassing it. JOSE sets itself apart with a strictly limited total supply of only 21 million tokens. This deliberate limitation not only fosters scarcity but also significantly enhances the potential for value growth. This strategic approach aims to create a more sustainable and investor-friendly environment.","links":"https://www.josecoin.fun","market_cap":17014.05,"market_cap_rank":10194,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/jose/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"Ff6CHymwNXFqES9mmf6PmSns3wAW4ykWgSgZJRMfH6dk","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/Ff6CHymwNXFqES9mmf6PmSns3wAW4ykWgSgZJRMfH6dk"}}}
