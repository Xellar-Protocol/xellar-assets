{"name":"Yawww","id":"yawww","symbol":"yaw","description":"The $YAW token is the platform-native utility token of Yawww.io, the hub for trading Solana NFTs. Yawww allows users to buy, sell, trade, stake, and collateralize NFTs for loans in a peer-to-peer format, secured by a smart-contract escrow protocol on Solana. The token can be used to cover any transaction fees, and in the future, $YAW may be used for B2B automated escrow services for DAOs, gaming, and metaverse projects. 50% of all platform revenue goes to the Yawww Treasury, a community-owned fund that is solely dedicated to supporting $YAW through token buybacks and burns, as well as community events & prizes.","links":"https://www.yawww.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/yawww/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"YAWtS7vWCSRPckx1agB6sKidVXiXiDUfehXdEUSRGKE"}}}
