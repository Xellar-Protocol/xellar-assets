{"name":"Rolling T-bill","id":"rolling-t-bill","symbol":"rtbl","description":"rTBL is an ERC-4626 token developed by PV01 that offers perpetual exposure to U.S. Treasury Bills on the Ethereum blockchain. It holds TBL tokens as its underlying assets; these TBL tokens are ERC-20 tokens representing digital bonds fully collateralized by specific U.S. Treasury Bills. Upon maturity of the held TBL tokens, the rTBL contract facilitates an automatic rollover into new TBL tokens corresponding to the next Treasury Bill. This mechanism allows holders to accrue virtually risk-free compound interest over time without manual intervention.","links":"https://www.pv0.one/","market_cap":2179594,"market_cap_rank":3160,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/rolling-t-bill/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0x526be1c610616be0e8e69893fc6766fddfbada61"}}}
