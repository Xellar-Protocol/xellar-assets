{"name":"Zeronauts","id":"zeronauts","symbol":"zns","description":"Zeronauts is an ecosystem to empower sustainability in the crypto industry. Zeronauts is a multi-chain launchpad and incubator for sustainable crypto projects. It is powered by a community-based token intelligence platform. The platform incentivizes crypto enthusiasts to write high-quality token reviews by rewarding them with the ZNS token. The crypto reviews are based on scientifically based rating methodologies that focus on sustainability. The methodologies are transparent and include indicators that consider long-term economic success, social justice and ecological responsibility. Based on the rating platform, Zeronauts awards tokens with a sustainability label once they reach a certain rating. A token can only be listed on the launchpad, when it attains a Zeronauts NFT label. The labels are created and stored as non-fungible tokens (NFT). They act as trust symbols and technical indicators. Independent of the launchpad, Zeronauts reviews can be requested. They motivate and guideline admins to increase the sustainability of their tokens and give detailed information to potential investors. Zeronauts supports the sustainable crypto movement and brings ecological and social responsibility to the crypto market. Moreover, Zeronauts transfers its sustainability efforts into the world outside of crypto. A percentage of the ZNS transaction fee is used to support sustainability projects worldwide.","links":"https://zeronauts.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/zeronauts/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x31582e4dd4906f2eb71c0d7b141aa097fb715491"}}}
