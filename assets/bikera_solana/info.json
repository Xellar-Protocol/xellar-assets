{"name":"Bikera","id":"bikera_solana","symbol":"imera","description":"Bikera is a blockchain-based mobility platform that rewards users for physical movement through tokenized incentives. The system combines IoT devices, decentralized consensus, and dual-token economics to create a sustainable \"move-to-earn\" ecosystem. iMERA is the public sale of the MERA token, launched on pump. XP is a token which will not hold value but is used to register km's driven on chain. The project is distributing tokens to reward people to use carbon neutral transportation in a decentralized manner. In the second stage we will be offering physical locks which allow for a bike sharing economy, logged with smart contracts on chain, still rewarding users and deployers for their efforts with block rewards.","links":"https://bikera.org","market_cap":18655.45,"market_cap_rank":9910,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bikera_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"FtrH7NCrPDkhDmKCCdTnsDBFxiibc1X5aJPHqKQnpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/FtrH7NCrPDkhDmKCCdTnsDBFxiibc1X5aJPHqKQnpump"}},"is_native":false}
