{"name":"Nabla","id":"nabla","symbol":"nabla","description":"Nabla Finance - The Yield protocol for the People Nabla Finance is a Yield protocol where the yield is generated by the Nabla AMM. Nabla AMM is a novel type of Automated Market Maker for Crypto, certain Real World Assets (e.g. stables, treasuries, commodities) and Yield Assets (e.g. LST and LRT). Its architecture almost entirely avoids Impermanent Loss (IL), whilst offering high capital efficiency. This enables much higher risk-adjusted returns for Liquidity Providers (LPs), and low swap costs for traders.","links":"https://www.nabla.fi","market_cap":1027763,"market_cap_rank":4124,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nabla/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x01ed85d73645523b0d62c7a8e35d03601cfd679b","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x01ed85d73645523b0d62c7a8e35d03601cfd679b"}}}
