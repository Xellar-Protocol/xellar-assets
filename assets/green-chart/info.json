{"name":"Green Chart","id":"green-chart","symbol":"green","description":"Tokenomics & Staking: Only one thing sells in the BSC, that’s a green chart. We have introduced the most daring tokenomics ever seen. We take 15% of all sells, and re buy our own token, and then burn the tokens! Our token is designed to remove any extra sell pressure, and add extra buying pressure. Causing a viscous cycle of buying pressure! We are one of the few BSC projects with staking, with reflection rewards for only staked tokens, this allows for massive APY % rewards + tokens that cant be sold. Increasing the value immensely! Global Vision: Our goal at Green Chart is to create a global asset that anyone can buy, with no crypto experience, yet all the crypto benefits! We will first develop our own mobile wallet application with a fiat buy button, allowing anyone from anywhere to own Green Chart with ease! We will then launch a massive multimedia marketing campaign to markets outside the crypto space with our app. This will result in massive exposure, making Green Chart a household name. Honesty & Transparency: We know crypto can feel like the wild west and mysterious. We don’t think it should be this way. Both team leaders and developers are fully doxed! We have put our faces on this project from day 1, on our own. We will continue to do live AMA’s with questions from you, the community","links":"https://www.green-chart.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/green-chart/logo.png"}
