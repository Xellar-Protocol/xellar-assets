{"name":"Nodeify","id":"nodeify","symbol":"ndfi","description":"Nodeify is a global scale Node-as-a-service (NaaS) platform that provides fully managed blockchain nodes to developers and investors across many networks and ecosystems. Nodeify enables investors to generate NDFI tokens by creating blockchain nodes across our supported networks (Fantom Opera, Avalanche, Near Protocol and Polygon). In addition, Nodeify incentivizes node operators to register their nodes with Nodeify Connect, which forfeits the operators' RPC endpoint in return for a variable increased reward rate based on developer demands for that specific node type. Nodeify Connect enables developers to build, test, and deploy decentralized applications via the nodes created by investors through our Software-as-a-Service offering. Nodeify aims at bridging DeFi and Developers by creating a world-class developer tooling suite utilizing compute capacity created by investors.","links":"https://nodeify.xyz","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nodeify/logo.png","detail_platform":{"fantom":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x7dcd01e3a119c8592a5aed681cdc9ed163090362"}}}
