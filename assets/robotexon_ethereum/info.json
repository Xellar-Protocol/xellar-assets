{"name":"Robotexon","id":"robotexon_ethereum","symbol":"rox","description":"Robotexon is building the world’s first monetization layer for robotics intelligence. Every robot is trained in simulations before it hits the real world, but 70–80% of that work goes unpaid. Robotexon turns those simulation outputs — control models, datasets, mission profiles — into verifiable, tokenized assets with built-in licensing and lifetime royalties. At the core is XTRON Core™, our proprietary engine that standardizes, secures, and prepares robotics data for on-chain publishing. These assets are sold in the Robotexon Marketplace, already integrated with major Chinese robotics manufacturers, creating demand-side liquidity from day one. Train once, earn forever — every sale, license, and royalty flows through the Robotexon token, building a self-sustaining economy in a $200B+ industry.","links":"https://www.robotexon.io/","market_cap":86386,"market_cap_rank":7246,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/robotexon_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x32d4c7ecee527a84d11250597a0725858a607369","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x32d4c7ecee527a84d11250597a0725858a607369"}},"is_native":false}
