The token has built in a unique first-of-its-kind Lottery Concept to encourage buy-wall on its chart and give investors peace of mind that their positions would not lose value because of panic selling. The methodology of the Lottery Concept involves the contract automatically entering any wallet that buys a minimum amount of 0.2 BNB worth of EVCoin tokens into a lottery pool recorded on the contract. At the end of each week, the qualifying addresses that hold a minimum of 50M EVCoin tokens would be entered into a random number picker(off chain), and the winning number is rewarded with the raffle price of $1,000.","links":"https://EverestCoin.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/everestcoin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x84b7bb9614cf28226d1b0a07499472bc107e3000"}}}
