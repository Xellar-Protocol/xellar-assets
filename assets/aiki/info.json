{"name":"Aiki","id":"aiki","symbol":"aiki","description":"Aiki is a Solana-based protocol that turns a simple “guess-the-character” game into an on-chain engine for training a sovereign artificial-intelligence model. Players pay a small, rising fee to ask yes/no questions; 80 % of each round’s pool goes to the first correct guess, 10 % seeds the next pot, and 10 % flows into a DAO-controlled master pool that funds audits, bug bounties, and future development. Every fee transaction automatically buys and burns $AIKI, creating continuous deflation, while every interaction is recorded as immutable data that improves the AI. Staking $AIKI grants governance rights over game parameters, treasury use, and new product launches, giving the community full control of the ecosystem’s evolution.","links":"https://aikigame.io/","market_cap":550457,"market_cap_rank":4985,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/aiki/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"aikiZ7nfvtnZh6gDqpeZ6LqURmqznY42eDPnU3GP18c","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/aikiZ7nfvtnZh6gDqpeZ6LqURmqznY42eDPnU3GP18c"}}}
