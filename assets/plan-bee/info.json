{"name":"Plan Bee","id":"plan-bee","symbol":"planb","description":"For many of us, it has often felt as though there was never truly a “Plan A.” Plan Bee, launched on the Abstract chain, was created to give our community a meaningful “Plan B” while shining a light on the critical role bees play in sustaining global ecosystems. Bees are essential to biodiversity, agriculture, and the balance of nature, yet their populations face ongoing threats. This project goes beyond raising awareness—it will actively partner with local bee farms to support real-world pollination efforts, cultivate honey, and make these products available to our community. Together, we can celebrate innovation on-chain while protecting one of the planet’s most vital species. The world needs bees, and it needs a Plan Bee.","market_cap":230055,"market_cap_rank":6233,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/plan-bee/logo.png","detail_platform":{"abstract":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x9301d2debe3c501a4bef6ba5b273b7bd346fa57e","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/abstract/tokens/0x9301d2debe3c501a4bef6ba5b273b7bd346fa57e"}}}
