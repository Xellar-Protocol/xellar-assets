{"name":"HoldME Token","id":"holdme-token","symbol":"holdme","description":"HoldME - a deflationary token fueled by real Bitcoin mining. Supply reduced by burns. No inflation—just real utility. No Promises. Just Action. HoldME’s core utility is marketing – but through our partnership with MineIT, we’ve established a sustainable cycle: mine cryptocurrencies, convert earnings, and burn HoldME tokens. This process transforms real mining revenue into deflationary momentum. Why the Burn Matters – It’s a Process. Born from the fusion of cutting-edge blockchain technology and tangible Bitcoin mining, HoldME is more than just a token – it’s a self-sustaining ecosystem. Every HoldME token purchased with mining revenue is sent to be burned, which permanently removes it from circulation. This action is transparent, on-chain, and irreversible. We don’t stake. We don’t redistribute. We don’t inflate. We execute a simple cycle – and make every step visible. The result isn’t speculation. It’s accountability.","links":"https://holdme.me/","market_cap":240586,"market_cap_rank":6162,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/holdme-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x7fc5f1561a987e1879a61ffcbb1cc52efd674705","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x7fc5f1561a987e1879a61ffcbb1cc52efd674705"}}}
