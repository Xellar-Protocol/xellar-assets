{"name":"Rivalz Network","id":"rivalz-network_solana","symbol":"riz","description":"Rivalz Network is building infrastructure designed to connect AI services and agents to various real-world resources. This infrastructure addresses a key challenge in the rapidly growing AI sector: limited access to digital assets, human interactions, and decentralized physical networks. By simplifying these connections, Rivalz Network aims to enhance the capabilities of AI agents in the broader AI economy. Core components of the Rivalz infrastructure: ROME – Swarm Protocol ROME is a tokenized swarm protocol focused on orchestrating AI agents backed by real-world resources, enabling large-scale coordination and deployment. OCY DePIN – Data Module OCY DePIN is an AI-native data layer built on a decentralized, peer-to-peer node network. It provides secure data processing, storage, and retrieval for AI-driven applications. ADCS – Connectivity Module ADCS functions as an AI oracle, allowing decentralized applications to request AI, data, and agentic responses in a verifiable manner. NOSTRINGS – Identity Module NOSTRINGS is designed to handle identity and resource mapping. It enables users to create AI agents and define the digital or physical resources—such as assets, personal data, or human labor—those agents can access. VORD – Application Module VORD serves as an AI and Web3 platform for building and publishing AI applications. It supports both no-code and developer-focused workflows, offering fast publishing, monetization opportunities, and integration of custom SDKs.","links":"https://rivalz.ai/","market_cap":878787,"market_cap_rank":3896,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/rivalz-network_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"93bVs9o8Nq88zxnLWwUAVfN5PXBhCcnV5sfs6AFLno8q","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/93bVs9o8Nq88zxnLWwUAVfN5PXBhCcnV5sfs6AFLno8q"}},"is_native":false}
