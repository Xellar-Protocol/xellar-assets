{"name":"macedo","id":"macedo_base","symbol":"macedo","description":"MACEDO is a Zora Creator Coin on Base, representing Filipe Macedo, co-founder of Talent Protocol. Creator Coins are profile-level tokens on Zora where each creator gets a single coin tied to their username. The token has a fixed supply of 1 billion, with 50% tradable via Uniswap V4 and 50% vesting to the creator over five years. Creators earn 1% on every trade. Filipe Macedo is using MACEDO as a Personal Index Token—a single token backed by a public treasury containing his project tokens (TALENT, BUILD, MACEDO), with regular buybacks and active rebalancing. The goal is to provide supporters with diversified exposure to everything he builds through one token.","links":"https://zora.co/@macedo","market_cap":117055,"market_cap_rank":6736,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/macedo_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x7b67f8e45f91e043f80eeaea52f3dc8ff1e55a5a","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x7b67f8e45f91e043f80eeaea52f3dc8ff1e55a5a"}},"is_native":false}
