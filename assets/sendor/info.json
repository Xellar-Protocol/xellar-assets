{"name":"Sendor","id":"sendor","symbol":"sendor","description":"The Big Blue Gigachad has been officially taken over by the community! Staying true to Matt Furieâ€™s visionary creativity and the concept of 'Mindviscosity,' Sendor remains the only sentient AI-powered Matt Furie-inspired meme on Solana. Sendor is a memecoin project on the Solana blockchain that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) with inspiration drawn from the creative universe of artist Matt Furie. It aims to build a community-driven platform where AI-generated content and memes promote self-improvement and empowerment. The project plans to develop a user-friendly interface for content creation, introduce Sendor-themed merchandise, integrate NFTs, and implement a staking system to reward community participation. With a total supply of 1 billion tokens, Sendor offers a fair launch with 90% allocated to the public and 10% reserved for the team. By combining art, AI, and cryptocurrency, Sendor seeks to create a unique and engaging experience within the memecoin landscape.","links":"https://www.solanasendor.com","market_cap":3848495,"market_cap_rank":2619,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/sendor/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"4dPW2SdbKcTEUiHpQRTWspT78zgS98v5TMhVpGPoPLzq"}}}
