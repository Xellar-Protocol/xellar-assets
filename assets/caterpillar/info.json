{"name":"CATERPILLAR","id":"caterpillar","symbol":"cpl","description":"In the vast garden, a lost caterpillar wandered, longing to spread his wings as a butterfly. Hearing of Caterpillar Token, he saw hope. But to change, he needed to sacrifice supply. With each transaction, the caterpillar burned 2% of the token supply, inching closer to his dream of becoming a butterfly. Along the journey, he met fellow caterpillars, all with their own dreams of a safe crypto experience that would help them grow. Together, they formed a community, supporting each other in their transformation. As the supply dwindled, each cocooned themselves, emerging as a majestic butterfly. And so, Caterpillar Token became a symbol of growth and safety, its supply burnt away to pave the way for wealth and beautiful transformations. Caterpillar token is a memecoin on the Binance Smart Chain. It has no dev, no roadmap, and a renounced contract. It is 100% community-driven.","links":"https://www.caterpillartoken.com/","market_cap":140586,"market_cap_rank":5826,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/caterpillar/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd0ed8f9c119beb13b9fce318a28827d0574c37d6"}}}
