{"name":"Sugar Bush the Squirrel","id":"sugar-bush-the-squirrel","symbol":"sugar","description":"The $SUGAR token, representing Sugar Bush the Squirrel, was launched on the Solana blockchain, bringing a character with a rich internet history into the realm of decentralized finance. This venture can be traced back to a 2013 thread on the Bitcointalks forum where Charles Hoskinson, later known as the founder of Cardano (ADA), made an effort to elevate Sugar Bush, who had already captured the internet's attention with over 6,000 photos in more than 400 outfits. Initially, the narrative was about making Sugar Bush a mascot for Bitcoin, showcasing the squirrel's versatility and charm. Now, $SUGAR on Solana not only revives this narrative but also leverages Solana's fast transaction speeds and low fees, aiming to create a unique community around this beloved and historically significant squirrel.","links":"https://sugarbushsol.com/","market_cap":78903,"market_cap_rank":6328,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/sugar-bush-the-squirrel/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"9wBNNCXg8pb4SZpTY868CEr74S25Qy1JmGHFwo9F37dC"}}}
