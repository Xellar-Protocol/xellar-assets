{"name":"Meter.io Wrapped stMTRG","id":"meter-io-wrapped-stmtrg","symbol":"wstmtrg","description":"wstMTRG is a wrapped version of stMTRG. stMTRG is liquid staking token on Meter Network. The amount of stMTRG balance is not constant; it changes daily as staking rewards come in. As some DeFi protocols require a constant balance mechanism for tokens, wstMTRG keeps the balance of stMTRG fixed and uses an underlying share system to reflect the staking rewards.","links":"https://staking.meter.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/meter-io-wrapped-stmtrg/logo.png","detail_platform":{"meter":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe2de616fbd8cb9180b26fcfb1b761a232fe56717"}}}
