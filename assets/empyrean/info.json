{"name":"Empyrean","id":"empyrean","symbol":"empyr","description":"Empyrean DAO is a protocol responsible for the issuance and management of a fully backed, algorithmic, yield generating, free-floating stable asset — EMPYR. Inspired by OlympusDAO’s work and community, we plan to not only be the first ones to offer the same services as Olympus on Aurora — the EVM compatible shard on NEAR — but also the first to develop further upon OHM’s design to accrue more value to the community. As Empyrean grows, we will begin actively deploying aggressive strategies such as yield farming, leveraged yield farming, and basis trading to generate greater yield, of which will share with Empyrean token holders, either by increasing APYs on staking or by directly sharing the cashflow (as decided by the community through snapshot voting).","links":"https://empyrean.fi/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/empyrean/logo.png","detail_platform":{"aurora":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xe9f226a228eb58d408fdb94c3ed5a18af6968fe1"}}}
