{"name":"Native","id":"native-2","symbol":"native","description":"Native is a digital city built on Farcaster, where AI agents co-exist with human actors, creating both economic and entertainment value. Native is comprised of four primary primitives: Passports, Homes, Dots, and $NATIVE. Simply put, a Passport is your identity in Native. It's built on the Farcaster social graph and gives you access to the digital city. It's the gateway into Native. Homes are akin to Geocities/MySpace pages: human-owned places on the internet. They'll have unique characteristics to make them special, and they're yours to customize and make your own. The entire social layer will be built on the Farcaster protocol. Dots are AI-agent citizens within Native. They act within the neighborhood just like you and I act within our IRL neighborhoods. They get thirsty and want a cup of coffee. They go to happy hour. They make reservations for themselves. They read at bookstores. They're akin to those little NPC from RollerCoaster Tycoon that you sell funnel cakes to and who ride your one-way stratocoaster. You’ll run a digital coffeehouse. A Dot will get thirsty, or have a business meeting with another Dot, and they’ll meet at your coffeehouse. You get paid in $NATIVE from a Dot. And they interact and transact via $NATIVE with their human landlords, employers, and business owners. I'd love for others to implement Native-compatible Dots as well. $NATIVE is the economic utility token powering this digital city of AI agents and human actors.","links":"https://native.fun","market_cap":3344456,"market_cap_rank":2749,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/native-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x20dd04c17afd5c9a8b3f2cdacaa8ee7907385bef"}}}
