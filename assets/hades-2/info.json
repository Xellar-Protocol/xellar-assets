{"name":"Hades","id":"hades-2","symbol":"hades","description":"HADES Token: Merging GameFi with DeFi on Ethereum Layer-2 Purpose: HADES is a groundbreaking project that combines elements of GameFi and DeFi within the Ethereum Layer-2 framework. It provides a unique platform where gaming and finance converge, offering users an engaging and profitable experience. Function: Deflationary Mechanism: The project employs a token burn strategy to manage inflation and boost token value. Tokens are burned in the process of summoning mythological characters (Cerberus, Zagreus, Persephone), thus reducing the total token supply. GameFi Elements: Players acquire character cards that offer daily rewards, integrating strategic gameplay with financial benefits. Reward Structure: Cerberus: Costs 50 HADES, yields a 5% daily reward. Zagreus: Costs 500 HADES, yields a 10% daily reward. Persephone: Costs 1000 HADES, yields a 15% daily reward. Utility: Token Supply Management: The initial supply of 100,000 HADES tokens is added to the liquidity pool. Participants purchase HADES tokens to acquire character cards, driving the game's economy. Economic Model: Features a 6/6 tax system on transactions, which supports strategic buybacks, maintenance, and further development. Sustained Growth and Balance: The project aims to foster long-term growth and equilibrium in the ecosystem, benefiting both gamers and investors. HADES blends mythological themes with strategic finance, creating a balanced and dynamic ecosystem in the cryptocurrency market.","links":"https://www.hadesmetis.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/hades-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"metis-andromeda":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf4085d70f4a72ee2433eb8963be59d3c0a503ed8"}}}
