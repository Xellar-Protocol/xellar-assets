MultiversX is a highly scalable, secure, and decentralized blockchain network created to enable radically new applications for users, businesses, society, and the new metaverse frontier. The EGLD Token is the native token powering the MultiversX Network. Universal is a cross-chain asset protocol that enables users to trade and utilize wrapped assets (uAssets) across multiple blockchains. uAssets are 1:1 backed representations of native cryptocurrencies, such as XRP, DOGE, and SUI, held in secure custody. This allows users to access and transact with assets that are not natively available on their preferred chains, without relying on bridges or centralized exchanges. Universal provides seamless trading, liquidity provision, and lending opportunities for uAssets, ensuring deep liquidity and security through institutional-grade custody and real-time proof of reserves.","links":"https://www.universal.xyz/tokens/uEGLD","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wrapped-multiversx-universal_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x16275fd42439a6671b188bdc3949a5ec61932c48","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x16275fd42439a6671b188bdc3949a5ec61932c48"}},"is_native":false}
