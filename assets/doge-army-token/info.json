{"name":"Doge Army","id":"doge-army-token","symbol":"dgat","description":"Doge Army Token (DGAT) is a unique community token for doge fans. We are built by doge fans, for doge fans, and our goal is to create a community where every doge fan can come together. We will continuously reward our community through weekly giveaway events and redistributions. Our mission is: Rewarding Holders, Helping Dogs and Killing Zeros! We will fulfill our mission by implementing our unique tokenomics. First of all the redistribution, from each transaction 2% will automatically redistribute to holders. Secondly the giveaways, within each transaction there is a 2% tax that will be sent to a specific wallet. Each week we will hold a giveaway to holders that meet the requirements. There will be a total of 5 people that will win. Lastly the Doge Army Foundation, there is a 1% tax within each transaction that will be send to the giveaway wallet. From this wallet we will donate every month to a charity chosen by our community. Of course, all of this will be done live and with proof. This token is made to build a community and give back to it.","links":"https://www.dogearmytoken.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/doge-army-token/logo.png"}
