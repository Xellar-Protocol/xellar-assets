{"name":"Torekko","id":"torekko","symbol":"trk","description":"Torekko is a French startup that develops a Metaverse that aims is to decentralize Japanimation. Torekko is a Play to Earn game, where users can play with characters from the Torekko universe as well as from official licences. In the long run, Torekko will produce animes and mangas. The Metaverse itself (the video game) is free, but to play users have to hold a NFT (their character/avatar in the game). We want our video game to be accessible to a large public, that is why NFTs price will be set between $20-$150, which is the price of a random video game on the market. The different game modes will be MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games), Battle royale, Meeting of friends, Exploration... Torekko has its own token, the TRK, which is already listed on many platforms and we want to continue our momentum by proposing it to your users by listing the token on CoinGecko. We are convinced that CoinGecko represents a key step in our development and we would be delighted to see this partnership come to fruition.","links":"https://torekko.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/torekko/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa2e3e2817f00822f3c1e71a604eca4196af923d6"}}}
