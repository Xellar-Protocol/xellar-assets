{"name":"ZAI Stablecoin","id":"zai-stablecoin","symbol":"usdz","description":"MAHA (previously known as MahaDAO) is a community-powered decentralized organization. Our mission is to create a stablecoin that is deeply rooted into the Ether-sphere. With integrations towards LRTs, Lending Protocols and DeFi for growth. At the heart of the ecosystem are two main tokens - MAHA and ZAI. ZAI (USDz) is a decentralized stablecoin within the MAHA ecosystem designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US Dollar (USD). ZAI is a highly scalable and over-collateralized stablecoin that can be used to leverage against crypto-native assets. ZAI aims to provide stability and liquidity without relying on traditional liquidation mechanisms or stability pools. Users can mint ZAI against traditional stablecoins, such as USDC and DAI, and leverage ZAI in various DeFi protocols and liquidity pools.","links":"https://maha.xyz/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/zai-stablecoin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x69000405f9dce69bd4cbf4f2865b79144a69bfe0"},"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xad2808bf820b9cc6b373bf52c63e501a183833dd"},"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x154f52b347d8e48b8dbd8d8325fe5bb45aadccda"},"blast":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xeb109ba8b4565e1ebf8845da3b78aba0c634655b"},"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x132ed59080de3b5063b4859108ba36734b302bac"},"linea":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xdb9c83cc3e2c61217ac1763232ba508da1064ba1"},"x-layer":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd077abe1663166c0920d41fd37ea2d9a00fabd40"},"scroll":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x44d4b627997b41abd2bf2ea05b731fe535f01c3d"},"optimistic-ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x3b2a34c8a085a6ca425ea64192d9f3a0b5dfb397"}}}
