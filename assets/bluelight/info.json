{"name":"Bluelight","id":"bluelight","symbol":"kale","description":"Bluelight is a free-to-play & earn game, a simulator of a startup in a virtual Silicon Valley, in which you build your own startup, manage your office and help the city to build, grow and prosper. The lore of the game is based on a universe of the Take My Muffin animation series, the first cartoon produced entirely by the crypto community. Bluelight token is a special in-game currency called $KALE, which is a cross-chain ERC-20 / BEP-20 fungible token. Currently, the token is issued on the Ethereum blockchain but can be easily transferred to BNB Chain. The main gameplay and token spend/earnings will take place on the BNB blockchain. This gives a lot of benefits to players, including fast, cheap transactions, accessibility, and stability. With $KALE you are able to buy or rent any of in-game assets like lands, buildings, officesâ€™ stuff, characters and etc. to build-up and to grow your own startup.","links":"https://bluelight.inc/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bluelight/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x508626d9a29d13eba26f843a2bd7bf7b00a45be5"}}}
