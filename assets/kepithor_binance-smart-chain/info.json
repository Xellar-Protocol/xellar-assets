KEPI powers an interconnected suite of blockchain games—such as Kingdom Karnage and Royal Rampage—enabling in-game purchases, and prize rewards. It’s designed for long-term sustainability with no fixed emissions, and it redistributes value through platform revenue and gameplay, rather than inflationary minting.","links":"https://Kepithor.com","market_cap":119167,"market_cap_rank":6721,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kepithor/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x099ea74ed0a30f6dcc5c7d5630ece2ab5d147812","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x099ea74ed0a30f6dcc5c7d5630ece2ab5d147812"}},"is_native":false}
