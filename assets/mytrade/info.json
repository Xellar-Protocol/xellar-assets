{"name":"Mytrade","id":"mytrade","symbol":"myt","description":"\"MyTrade is the next generation Moonbeam and Polygon DEX that looks and feels like a centralized exchange with a wide variety of quality tradable assets. Takers will get the best price, and Makers enjoy 0% trading fees! DEX with a Centralized Exchange User Experience: Trade directly from your crypto wallet. MyTrade doesn't hold your funds when you trade: you have 100% ownership of your own assets. Unlike other decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap or Sushiswap, MyTrade is not just a swap. It has a professional user interface and features just like top centralized exchanges like Binance. MyTrade users can enjoy price charts, limit orders and trade history. Integrated Liquidity: MyTrade features both an order book and AMM. MyTrade has coined a new term called Integrated Liquidity, which is the combined total liquidity from both AMM liquidity pool and order book. MyTrade's unique algorithm has precisely integrated these two liquidity sources, and is thus able to provide traders with the best execution price. Highest Capital Efficiency: MyTrade V2 is the first DEX to introduce Limit Order Mining. This feature incentivizes users to place orders on the order book and will significantly increase professional Market Maker's capital efficiency. MyTrade V2 Beta launched on Polygon in October 2021, and will be launching on Moonbeam in March 2022. MyTrade V2 with MYT launched in March 2022.\"","links":"https://mytrade.org/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mytrade/logo.png"}
