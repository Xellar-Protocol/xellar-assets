{"name":"Wrapped CrowdStrike xStock","id":"wrapped-crowdstrike-xstock_arbitrum-one","symbol":"wcrwdx","description":"For too long, investing has come with barriers. Borders. Brokers. Limitations. It’s been complicated, costly, and — for millions — out of reach. xStocks were created to change that. xStocks are tokenized stocks. They’re backed 1:1 by the underlying assets, composable with DeFi protocols, compliant with EU regulations, accessible to non-US users, and provide a legal claim to the value of the stock. xStocks enable easy access to 57 US Stocks and ETFs to regular users through top centralized and decentralized exchanges, and can be integrated with other DeFi protocols like any other token. This is a wrapped xStock, meaning that it does not rebase, allowing it to be used within DeFi applications.","links":"https://xstocks.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wrapped-crowdstrike-xstock_arbitrum-one/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd71a6adbc40c2674591cdb11b8c7ae03a880b06e","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/arbitrum/tokens/0xd71a6adbc40c2674591cdb11b8c7ae03a880b06e"}},"is_native":false}
