{"name":"RhinoFi","id":"rhinofi-2","symbol":"rhino","description":"RhinoFi is built for rhythm, not randomness. Each Charging Cycle rewards holders, applies a decaying sell tax to deter early exits, and buys/burns RHINO from the market—turning volatility into a value driver instead of a threat. RhinoFi is the first Combat Token on PulseChain—a new asset class engineered to thrive in volatile markets where traditional tokens fail. Designed for sustainability and reflexive growth, RhinoFi deploys a strategic combination of token burns, external yield generation, and smart reflections to reward holders with additional options for reflections tokens including Solidx, Gelato, Hex, Inc, eHex, Pulsex and Rhino. Our 28-day Charging Cycle introduces a protocol rhythm that encourages long-term holding and provides decentralized, programmatic buy pressure on $RHINO itself.","links":"https://rhinofi.win/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/rhinofi-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"pulsechain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6c6d7de6c5f366a1995ed5f1e273c5b3760c6043","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/pulsechain/tokens/0x6c6d7de6c5f366a1995ed5f1e273c5b3760c6043"}}}
