{"name":"Compute Network","id":"compute-network","symbol":"dcn","description":"$DCN powers the world's first scalable, decentralized, user-owned pay-per-use compute market place! With $DCN you will finally stop paying for renting and start paying for your actual computing usage! Compute Network is redefining scalable computing by combining cloud power with unused resources from around the world. We’re the first to mix cloud servers, our own dedicated servers, and decentralized, user-owned machines to offer a new kind of computing power that’s not only powerful but also eco-friendly. This makes us stand out in a field with big names like $TAO, $ICP, and $BLENDR, especially since we’re focused on general-purpose computing on a global scale. Our approach tackles a big problem: traditional computing is often expensive and rigid. Businesses usually pay too much for server space they don’t fully use and struggle to keep up with changing tech demands. Compute Network changes this. We use the untapped potential of devices worldwide, turning them into a massive network. This network is flexible, cost-effective, and environmentally smarter than traditional setups, making computing easier and more accessible for everyone.","links":"https://computenetwork.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/compute-network/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0f8958c757b65881cec98028cae0c4ee45726eae"}}}
