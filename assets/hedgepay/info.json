{"name":"HedgePay","id":"hedgepay","symbol":"hpay","description":"HedgePay is a DeFi protocol that uses its transactional tax to generate user rewards by leveraging liquidity mining of various projects. With the upcoming release of our DEX, ecommerce platform, freelancer platform and our new automated launch pad compatible with any chain, we believe we have a chance to establish a greater independence from transactional taxes. This will allow future contributors a chance to speculate on market price and increase consistency in volume of our token. This will also make us compatible with many CEX and improve our overall adoption.","links":"https://hedgepay.org","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/hedgepay/logo.png"}
