As such, it is responsible for the network, computation and storage layers of the protocol. TSN is a stand-alone byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) network designed to facilitate the development of innovative data-driven web3 applications. The availability of data is guaranteed by our network of node operators, as well as individual customers and asset managers. The TRUF token governs and secures the Truflation protocol and rewards its users for their participation.","links":"https://truf.network/","market_cap":10173912,"market_cap_rank":1776,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/truflation/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x243c9be13faba09f945ccc565547293337da0ad7","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x243c9be13faba09f945ccc565547293337da0ad7"},"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb59c8912c83157a955f9d715e556257f432c35d7","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/arbitrum/tokens/0xb59c8912c83157a955f9d715e556257f432c35d7"},"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb59c8912c83157a955f9d715e556257f432c35d7","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xb59c8912c83157a955f9d715e556257f432c35d7"}}}
