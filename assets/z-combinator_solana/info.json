{"name":"Z Combinator","id":"z-combinator_solana","symbol":"zc","description":"Z Combinator is a token launchpad platform that aims to fix the problems with existing cryptocurrency token launches by changing how tokens are distributed and rewarded. Unlike traditional launchpads that encourage developers to create tokens with fixed supplies and then abandon projects after initial trading volume spikes, Z Combinator automatically mints 1 million new tokens every 24 hours directly to project builders, preventing them from manipulating supply while ensuring they have ongoing funding tied to their project's long-term market performance rather than short-term trading activity. The platform charges zero fees for both token launches and trading, starts all tokens with 1 billion initial supply on a bonding curve before migrating to standard automated market makers, and gives builders tools to manage their newly minted tokens for rewarding contributors and growing their communities sustainably. This approach aligns the interests of both project builders and token holders by making developer rewards dependent on sustained market cap growth over time rather than quick profit-taking strategies.","links":"https://zcombinator.io","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/z-combinator_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"GVvPZpC6ymCoiHzYJ7CWZ8LhVn9tL2AUpRjSAsLh6jZC","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/GVvPZpC6ymCoiHzYJ7CWZ8LhVn9tL2AUpRjSAsLh6jZC"}},"is_native":false}
