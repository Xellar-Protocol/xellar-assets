{"name":"NOKKI","id":"nokki_solana","symbol":"nokki","description":"NOKKI doesn’t rule through crowns or thrones. His way of holding the universe together comes from curiosity, humor, and a spark of wonder. Every orbit, every falling star, every strange ripple across the galaxy carries his touch. He reminds us that the cosmos is not just cold and distant — it can also feel alive, clumsy, and strangely warm.","links":"https://nokki.xyz","market_cap":6404.46,"market_cap_rank":11990,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nokki_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"HWVYokjL4ugzUWqJZfLPCYikkR4EANxWjYKvGYXGCyHq","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/HWVYokjL4ugzUWqJZfLPCYikkR4EANxWjYKvGYXGCyHq"}},"is_native":false}
