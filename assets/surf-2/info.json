{"name":"Surf","id":"surf-2","symbol":"surf","description":"SurfLiquid is an on-chain DeFAI (DeFi + AI) agent that manages stablecoin yield for users in a fully non-custodial way. Users connect a wallet, deposit USDC to a personal smart vault, and the agent allocates across vetted lending markets and liquidity pools, rebalancing and compounding automatically. Every action is on-chain and auditable. The system targets practical problems in yield management: missed rebalance windows, gas drag, fragmented pools, and manual monitoring. Surf runs on Base first and integrates a multi-chain execution layer so strategies can expand across EVM networks without users bridging manually. Guardrails include protocol allowlists, position caps, and continuous health checks. The $SURF token powers access to strategy tiers, staking rewards via the Conviction Vault, and governance over parameters like pool allowlists and fee settings. In short, SurfLiquid provides a transparent, self-custodial way to put idle stablecoins to work with AI handling execution and reporting.","links":"https://www.surfliquid.com/","market_cap":1214592,"market_cap_rank":3899,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/surf-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xcdca2eaae4a8a6b83d7a3589946c2301040dafbf","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xcdca2eaae4a8a6b83d7a3589946c2301040dafbf"}}}
