{"name":"UNIA Farms","id":"unia-farms","symbol":"unia","description":"UNIA Farms is a yield farming protocol on Arbitrum, allowing users to join standard or locked farms with the most optimal LPs on Arbitrum. The protocol features NFT Staking, Launchpads and an upcoming sports betting platform utilising the farms. The aim of the project is to expand the DeFi ecosystem on Arbitrum through more LP utilisation purposes, while giving incubator support to new projects trying to launch on the chain through a grant system. The UNIA token also features a 3% sale tax that is automatically burned out of circulation, allowing the restriction of overly inflated supply expansion. The project tokenomics are simple and contained in a very low supply methodology with 5.000,000 UNIA as the max supply, no team, marketing or development token allocations, and a conservative emission rate.","links":"https://farm.uniwswap.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/unia-farms/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe547fab4d5ceafd29e2653cb19e6ae8ed9c8589b"}}}
