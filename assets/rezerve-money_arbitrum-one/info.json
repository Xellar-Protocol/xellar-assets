{"name":"Rezerve Money","id":"rezerve-money_arbitrum-one","symbol":"rzr","description":"RZR is a on-chain MicroStrategy focused on accumulating 5,000 BTC with the power of Community & DeFi. Rezerve is a fair-launched reserve currency that captures every cent of protocol revenue and sends it straight back to the people who stake it—no VCs, no insiders, no backstage market-makers. Key Features - Continuous Price Discovery: Every asset on RZR is always for sale at its self-assessed price, ensuring trading opportunities whenever valuation shifts. - Harberger Tax Revenue: A predictable, ongoing tax on declared asset values that builds protocol-controlled value without selling tokens. - Seamless Compounding Bonds: Our RZR bond integrates vesting and auto-restaking over three 4-day cycles, capturing every epoch’s yield without manual steps. - Flexible Governance: Proposals cover tax rates, bond discounts, surplus thresholds and emergency pause controls, all enacted via on-chain votes. - Robust Safeguards: A multi-tier defense ladder—from reward throttling to inverse bonds, surplus-buffer draws, stake slashing and insurance auctions—keeps the protocol solvent under stress.","links":"https://rezerve.money/","market_cap":1790362,"market_cap_rank":3091,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/rezerve-money/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb4444468e444f89e1c2cac2f1d3ee7e336cbd1f5","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/arbitrum/tokens/0xb4444468e444f89e1c2cac2f1d3ee7e336cbd1f5"}},"is_native":false}
