{"name":"Goldex","id":"goldex-token","symbol":"gldx","description":"Goldex Token is formed by the various asset funds algorithm used in order to prevent manipulative movements for the base price formation. The mechanism of these funds, which are created at certain rates, working with instant transaction prices in the world stock markets, is also the main factor. It acts as a breakwater against big fluctuations in price. The base price of each Goldex Token starts with the division of the commodity averages in which mutual funds are currently evaluated, at the rate that constitutes the starting price of 1.1 Usdt. In simple terms, with a reciprocal transaction volume of approximately 9M, it is possible for a Goldex token to reach 96.8 usdt with an increase of approximately 88 times in a very short time.","links":"https://gldxtoken.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/goldex-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"0xc631120155621ee625835ec810b9885cdd764cd6"}}}
