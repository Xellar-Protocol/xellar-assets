{"name":"Binance Yellow Robot","id":"binance-yellow-robot_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"bina","description":"$BINA is a community-driven memecoin born from an online event involving a fake Binance mascot and a social media interaction by Binance’s former CEO, CZ. The project originated when a grifter used edited images and CZ’s follow to create false legitimacy, causing temporary market hype. After the original scam collapsed, the crypto community reclaimed the narrative, transforming the chaos into a decentralized social experiment. $BINA now represents transparency, satire, and community resilience within crypto culture, preserving the story as a reminder of how collective action can turn manipulation into meaning.","links":"https://www.binaonbnb.xyz/","market_cap":149957,"market_cap_rank":6355,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/binance-yellow-robot/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0c5429e9dd1362bfb55c31c01b7f0f38f5f64444","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x0c5429e9dd1362bfb55c31c01b7f0f38f5f64444"}},"is_native":false}
