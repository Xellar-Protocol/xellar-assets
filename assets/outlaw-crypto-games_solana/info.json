{"name":"OUTLAW Crypto Games","id":"outlaw-crypto-games_solana","symbol":"outlaw","description":"What is Outlaw GameFi? Mini-Game Platform: Outlaw is positioned as the first mini-game platform on Jupiter Studio, focusing on fun, skill-based, family-friendly games. GameFi Model: It combines gaming with decentralized finance — classic GameFi. That means players don’t just play for entertainment; gameplay feeds into a token economy. Profit Sharing: The unique hook is that profits from the mini-games flow directly back to $OUTLAW holders. So as games get played and generate revenue, token holders benefit. Narrative Fit: GameFi is already seen as a strong narrative in the broader crypto cycle, and Outlaw taps into that sector while adding its own twist with mini-games and profit distribution.
