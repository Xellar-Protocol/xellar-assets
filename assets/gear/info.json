{"name":"Gear","id":"gear","symbol":"gear","description":"\"Generous Robots DAO is a collection of 5555 randomly generated robots on Solana. 70% of mint sales and royalties will go directly to the community-led DAO fund. Generous Robots NFT holder are eligible to receive 4 $GEAR per day per NFT staked. Longer NFT Staking = Higher Payouts. First utility token to reward long-term holders $GEAR is a first-ever deflationary utility token burned with IDO profits. This token is the backbone of the Generous Robots DAO ecosystem. It's a unique game theory experiment. Starting supply is zero. $GEAR is emitted only via staking Emissions and Burning Mechanisms :GreenFire: In order to create sustainable tokenomics we've built multiple token burning mechanisms, including but not limited to: 1. IDO Profits Buyback 2. Breeding 3. VC Fund Access (Burn $GEAR to get access to private rounds) 4. Royalties from the second collection buyback 5. Other Mechanisms (DegenCoinFlip, Merch) Additionally - to control the emissions a decay coefficient has been introduced: Amount of $GEAR issued next month = the previous month's emissions * 96.02%. This way in about 60 months the emission of $GEAR will be close to zero - keeping it scarce and valuable! \"","links":"https://generousrobots.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gear/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"7s6NLX42eURZfpyuKkVLrr9ED9hJE8718cyXFsYKqq5g"}}}
