{"name":"VoltGo Token","id":"voltgo-token_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"vtgo","description":"VoltGo is a decentralized smart-charging ecosystem built on blockchain technology and AI-driven scheduling, initiated by Nexus CIM Core Ltd. The project focuses on next-generation intelligent power solutions, aiming to transform portable power banks, fixed charging stations, and vehicle chargers into hardware that not only delivers reliable charging services but also generates stable activity data and integrates hardware revenues with digital assets. VoltGo enables real-time reporting of key metrics — including charging duration, energy consumption, and fault status — which are synchronized to the blockchain ledger to ensure transparency, security, and immutability. Smart contracts further enhance the ecosystem by automatically executing reward distribution and governance incentives. Revenues are allocated proportionally and in real time to digital asset holders and device deployers, ensuring a fair and efficient value-sharing model across the network.","links":"https://voltgo.cc","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/voltgo-token_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf892fc3c0c45471fd06ace8533b29eb84d3f2953","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xf892fc3c0c45471fd06ace8533b29eb84d3f2953"}},"is_native":false}
