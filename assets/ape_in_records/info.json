{"name":"Ape In Records","id":"ape_in_records","symbol":"air","description":"\"$AIR was developed to help support established & upcoming artists, producers, songwriters along with unsigned hype to help rebalance unfair music label contracts and provide a platform for new talent to get recognised and supported. Traditional record label deals with artists are infamously unfair with the lion’s share of the proceeds benefiting the label vs the artist. We created $Air to support established artists, producers, and songwriters to rebalance this equation. We’ll provide them with equipment, studio time, along with tour & music video support to ensure they can keep creating. We’ll also help discover and support unsigned hype to help them get the $AIR time they deserve.\"","links":"https://apeinrecords.org/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ape_in_records/logo.png"}
