{"name":"SolPatrol Bail","id":"solpatrol-bail","symbol":"bail","description":"Sol Patrol is a quant DAO. The DAO was launched as a NFT Collection called 'Sol Patrol'. As the creator, I wanted to crowdsource the thinking aspect of being a quant dev. Rather than a few individuals creating models and theories, you have the entire DAO working together and then the developers and creator can focus on just building and filtering. We also have an entire lore, gamification and staking for the NFT collection. The lore is based on us being the cops of Solana and the first game we released was the \"Jail\" and here a user can post-$BAIL (spend tokens) to receive random NFTs that are purchased by the DAO treasury.","links":"https://solpatrol.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/solpatrol-bail/logo.png"}
