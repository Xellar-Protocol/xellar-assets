It focuses on meme, cat, and crypto cultures. It uses AI support. The project is powered by the $KULT token, and is governed by $KULT holders. Ж is building Mewtopia, a fictional universe inspired by cats, memes and crypto. Kult plays a central role as the chaotic good leader of the Kitty Kult. Mewtopia uses community applications, including Kultify and Kultify AI. Kultify is an X monitoring tool. It tracks and rewards community engagement, such as posting or reposting about the project. Kultify AI is a generative AI Telegram app (that could also work on web and Discord), that generates image content featuring the Kult character in the Mewtopia world.","links":"https://kittykult.org","market_cap":169115,"market_cap_rank":6174,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kitty-kult/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x9999999999999d8b360c6985db1a74a0f3b75e1b","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x9999999999999d8b360c6985db1a74a0f3b75e1b"}},"is_native":false}
