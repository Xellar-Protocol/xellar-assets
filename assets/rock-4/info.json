{"name":"ROCK","id":"rock-4","symbol":"rock","description":"$ROCK is more than just a meme; it’s a bold statement in the TRON blockchain community, embodying the spirit of fun and irreverence that has swept across the world of cryptocurrencies and NFTs. While many projects strive to offer utility and practical applications, $ROCK proudly embraces its role as a completely useless coin. It’s a playful nod to the absurdity that sometimes defines the crypto space, where value isn’t always tied to utility. The rocks have already cemented their place in the NFT world, celebrated for their tongue-in-cheek commentary on digital art and ownership. Now, $ROCK continues this legacy in the crypto market, representing the pure, unadulterated joy of participation without any pretense of usefulness. This coin isn’t about solving problems or revolutionizing industries; it’s about having fun, being part of a community that laughs in the face of convention, and celebrating the ridiculous side of blockchain technology. In a world where every project claims to be groundbreaking, $ROCK stands out by not trying to be anything other than what it is: a totally useless, yet irresistibly fun, meme coin. Join the $ROCK movement and embrace the absurd!","links":"https://tronrock.meme/","market_cap":176723,"market_cap_rank":5615,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/rock-4/logo.png","detail_platform":{"tron":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"TJvwMR3RjHc8jA9QwwjWGANrR3Y4scLSZm"}}}
