{"name":"Ecorpay","id":"ecorpay_solana","symbol":"ecor","description":"Ecorpay is a next-generation cryptotoken built to make digital value transfer more intuitive, useful, and future-ready. Unlike many tokens that exist in name only, Ecorpay is designed for real interaction - moving across blockchains, powering decentralized applications, and supporting real-world utility. Its cross-chain compatibility ensures users aren’t tied to a single platform, making it easier to engage with a broader Web3 ecosystem. What sets Ecorpay apart is its purpose-driven design: the tokenomics model encourages long-term participation and rewards meaningful contribution. Users who actively support the network—whether through governance, staking, or building—play a direct role in shaping its development. Community governance is embedded at the protocol level, giving holders a real voice in key decisions and future developments. At its core, Ecorpay is built on values of transparency, accessibility, and progress. It’s not just about being part of the crypto economy—it’s about helping define where that economy is headed. In a space full of noise, Ecorpay offers clarity, connection, and a token that actually does something valuable, comparing to others.","links":"https://token.ecorpay.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ecorpay_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"6wQDzAZT17HYABu7rNXBDUSgNzDeGUUUzY2cS8wpEGAc","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/6wQDzAZT17HYABu7rNXBDUSgNzDeGUUUzY2cS8wpEGAc"}},"is_native":false}
