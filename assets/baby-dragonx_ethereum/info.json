{"name":"Baby DragonX","id":"baby-dragonx_ethereum","symbol":"bdx","description":"Tokenomics play a vital role in shaping the dynamics and sustainability of a cryptocurrency ecosystem. The Baby DragonX protocol (token name $BDX), operating within the Ethereum TITAN X ecosystem, leverages innovative mechanisms centered around a fair launch, along with token burns and minting using $TITANX to enhance scarcity, drive demand, and offer unique benefits to participants. This DragonPaper delineates the foundational principles, mechanisms, and strategies employed by Baby DragonX to foster a robust and sustainable token economy within the broader TITAN X framework. Short term goal is to create the first memecoin built on DragonX with a doxxed founder team, fair launch, and being both highly secure and successful on time launch. Mid term goals are to grow the community and have hundreds then thousands of wallets holding $BDX. In addition we will activate the Grant and Investment Pools to grow the protocol. Longer term goals include the creation of The Baby DragonX Adventure branded NFT collection, integrating/collaborating with other existing and new protocols in the TITAN X ecosystem while creating real value for wallets holding $BDX.","links":"https://www.babydragonx.win/","market_cap":153730,"market_cap_rank":6315,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/baby-dragonx_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x9f278dc799bbc61ecb8e5fb8035cbfa29803623b","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x9f278dc799bbc61ecb8e5fb8035cbfa29803623b"}},"is_native":false}
