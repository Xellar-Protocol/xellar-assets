{"name":"Internet Money (BSC)","id":"internet-money-bsc_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"im","description":"Internet Money (IM) was created to serve as a form of peer to peer \"digital cash\". The contract is simple: you can buy, sell, send and burn IM. Internet Money has no admin keys, no taxes, no reflections and is deflationary. Cryptocurrency was created to be a decentralized way to interact with money. We aim to take continual steps towards the decentralization of every facet of the Internet Money ecosystem; because we believe this is the way money should be: No centralized entities. No controlling forces. Power in the hands of the people.","links":"https://internetmoney.io","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/internet-money-bsc_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xac5d23ce5e4a5eb11a5407a5fbee201a75e8c8ad","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xac5d23ce5e4a5eb11a5407a5fbee201a75e8c8ad"}},"is_native":false}
