{"name":"SafeBlast","id":"safeblast","symbol":"blast","description":"\"SafeBLAST (BLAST) is both a UTILITY and a DEFLATIONARY token available on multiple blockchains. As a utility token, you can use BLAST for direct payment on goods and services where accepted worldwide. As a deflationary token, SafeBLAST is an Autonomous yield and Liquidity generation protocol. Every time someone transfers, buys or sells BLAST tokens on PancakeSwap, the total supply goes down. Every transaction also creates a passive effortless reward distribution for all token HODLers on the BNB Blockchain, which is where PancakeSwap transactions takes place. There is NO buy or sell tax on Centralized exchanges or Uniswap, which is why there is NO reward distribution either. Distribution is only to the wallets on Binance Chain (BNB Chain). Liquidity is also generated and locked automatically to support the ecosystem on PancakeSwap. As the circulating supply becomes limited, supply and demand will play a big role in the value growth, which is a win-win for BLAST holders.\"","links":"https://safeblastcrypto.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/safeblast/logo.png"}
