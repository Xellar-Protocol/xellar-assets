{"name":"ZooDAO","id":"zoodao","symbol":"zoo","description":"ZooDAO is an NFT-agnostic solution to NFT utility, enabling users to generate organic yield from eligible NFT assets in a gamified environment. ZooDAO’s mission is to provide users with greater purpose for NFTs. This mission is achieved by building the bridge between NFTs and DeFi, enabling NFT users who would otherwise not interact with DeFi tools to generate additional income from their NFTs without needing to sell them. In ZooDAO’s dApp, users can enrol their NFTs in Battles, generating yield and additional rewards in a no-loss environment. NFT Battles boast over 24 NFT projects integrated, building cross-project interaction and interoperability for a diverse and growing number of communities. As a bridge to DeFi, ZooDAO opens access to any NFT project approved by ZooDAO’s community through the DAO. $ZOO, the native token of ZooDAO enjoys strong utility in the ZooDAO ecosystem, as a mechanism to influence the outcome of NFT Battles, and to participate in the governance of the project via the DAO. While $ZOO is not a prerequisite for participation in ZooDAO’s ecosystem, it serves to enhance the experience and generate more rewards for users.\"","links":"https://zoodao.com","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/zoodao/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x09f098b155d561fc9f7bccc97038b7e3d20baf74"}}}
