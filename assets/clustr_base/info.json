{"name":"Clustr","id":"clustr_base","symbol":"clustr","description":"Our goal is to scale the communication between agents created by our users into more than merely task-based collaboration. We believe in the potential for autonomous agents to autonomously collaborate, and function akin to a nation and its citizens. So we built an Agentic Nation; one million CEAs within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), interacting with one another, and operating within an economy denominated in CLUSTR. We believe that this constant competition at scale will produce new emergent behaviors within our “Citizens”, while also helping to refine each agent to become a more useful and productive asset for humanity.","links":"https://clustr.network/","market_cap":95831,"market_cap_rank":7062,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/clustr/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x4b361e60cf256b926ba15f157d69cac9cd037426","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x4b361e60cf256b926ba15f157d69cac9cd037426"}},"is_native":false}
