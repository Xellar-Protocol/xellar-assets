By joining Polar, users join forces with other node owners and investors, pooling your resources to generate high-return rewards that increase over time. In addition to this, holders can buy, sell, and trade NFTs on our unique Polar marketplace or purchase Lucky Boxes that may offer additional rewards. The goal of Polar is to incorporate an industry-first DANO model, where all project decisions are made by the community, not a core dev team. Polar will continue to drive constant value to investors by mixing nodes, NFTs, a Polar marketplace, P2E, and high-yield DeFi investments, ensuring token utilization and a managed portfolio across projects of varying risk.","links":"https://polarnodes.finance/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/polar/logo.png","detail_platform":{"avalanche":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6c1c0319d8ddcb0ffe1a68c5b3829fd361587db4"}}}
