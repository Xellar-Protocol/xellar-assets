{"name":"Arcade Canine","id":"arcade-canine","symbol":"okinu","description":"Arcade Canine aims to create both a strong memecoin community and a gaming experience in a retro ambience provided in our arcade 3D website. Our website will become more interactive over the weeks where users will be able to buy our token, play arcade games with our machines, enter into our Mystery 3D Game and win prizes while solving 3D Escape Rooms. The website has been created using ThreeJS library which makes it possible to connect with web3 and hence create dApps that are integrated in our website. The first Arcade games that the project will develop will be live during the first month of the project launch. These games will have a weekly leaderboard that will track the gaming scores of the users. By connecting via Metamask users will then have a score associated with their wallet, the scores will be tracked on a leaderboard and the highest ranking users will be rewarded with tokens. Games will change monthly as well as the prizes which might increase or decrease depending on the market conditions and the advice of the community and creators.","links":"https://okinuarcade.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/arcade-canine/logo.png"}
