{"name":"Dragon War","id":"dragon-war","symbol":"draw","description":"Dragon War is a turn-based strategy game in which characters are represented by unique NFTs on the blockchain system. The NFT will give players much better ownership rights as it is truly owned by them at their wallet address. These NFT characters are also very distinguished, with different appearance, attributes, and characteristics. They can’t be tampered with and are completely on-chain. The NFT dragons will be built and minted, and should consist of many different unique body parts. If Axies can either be of pure breed or a hybrid of many different types with many different parts and abilities, Your dragons would like to be built in the same way. All dragon’s body parts have their own strengths and weaknesses. And this system means they can make every battle a different experience. Since the strategy is key, you’ll want to pay attention to synergies between characters, dragon line-up, power cards and items also. Synergies are a critical part of your strategy. Your own elemental dragon will consist of 4 characteristic attributes: Earth — Fire — Thunder — Water and the incompatible mechanics in the game are Fire > Earth > Thunder > Water > Fire. They are similar to the rock-paper-scissor game.","links":"https://dragonwar.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dragon-war/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":0,"contract_address":"48AEwauAHsJibyt3WqjQ6EoHnFBcnyHASfo7vB2eCXPS"}}}
