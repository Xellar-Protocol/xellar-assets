{"name":"Paradise Defi","id":"paradise-defi","symbol":"pdf","description":"Within the Paradise DeFi platform, we offer several different staking pools for our $PDF token, each with varying lock-up periods. The main difference between these pools is the length of time that your $PDF tokens will be locked up for. The $PDF token is the native currency for our staking, lending, and bonds decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. It is used as the primary means of transacting within the platform, and its value is determined by market demand for the platform's services. In addition to staking, we will also offer other products such as bonds and stablecoins that can generate income. Our bonds, for example, allow you to lend your $PDF tokens to the platform in exchange for a fixed return over a certain period of time. Our stablecoins can also be used as a store of value and generate interest through lending platforms. To maximize your earning potential on Paradise DeFi, we recommend that you review all of the available options and choose the ones that best fit your investment goals and risk tolerance. Be sure to keep an eye on our website and social media channels for updates on new products and features that may be added in the future.","links":"https://paradisedefi.app/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/paradise-defi/logo.png"}
