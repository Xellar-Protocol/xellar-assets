{"name":"Vanity","id":"vanity-2","symbol":"vnty","description":"VanityBazaar is a pioneering platform in the Solana ecosystem that transforms blockchain addresses from random alphanumeric strings into branded, personalized identities. Built on Solana's high-performance blockchain, VanityBazaar empowers users to own memorable wallet addresses, create meaningful brand identities, and participate in a vibrant social ecosystem centered around these custom digital identities. By combining a marketplace for pre-generated vanity addresses, a custom address generation service, and an integrated social platform with novel token economics, VanityBazaar addresses a fundamental gap in blockchain user experience: the lack of personalization and identity in the wallet address space. Our platform utilizes a dual-token economy with a deflationary mechanism, referral rewards, and innovative monetization strategies to ensure sustainable growth. This white paper outlines the technical architecture, business model, and vision of VanityBazaar as we scale to become the definitive destination for blockchain identity in the Solana ecosystem and beyond.","market_cap":26816,"market_cap_rank":9501,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/vanity-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"9Zp9zE5hUioEdDfphRQfCwHWDAbqYM2YECvF8iSapump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/9Zp9zE5hUioEdDfphRQfCwHWDAbqYM2YECvF8iSapump"}}}
