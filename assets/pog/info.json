{"name":"Pog","id":"pog","symbol":"pog","description":"From gaming roots to memecoin. The image that started it all featured streamer Ryan \"Gootecks\" Gutierrez with a shocked or surprised expression during a viral moment, eventually becoming one of the most iconic Twitch emotes. Pog is all about that raw emotion and capturing a moment in time. Scored a Victory Royale live on stream? POG. Born from gaming culture, our project now brings the pog spirit to life through a penguin inspired by the classic Pingu animations—arguably one of the first true poggers. The heart of our project is simple: anyone can pog, and a pog moment can happen anytime, anywhere. In the world of crypto, there are endless pog moments, from life-changing events to unforgettable experiences.","links":"https://www.pogonsolana.com","market_cap":38697,"market_cap_rank":7897,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pog/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"6gVJwfHxWov8HxdAZ4v4tt2RpZZst6du74y4bUCdpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/6gVJwfHxWov8HxdAZ4v4tt2RpZZst6du74y4bUCdpump"}}}
