{"name":"Bullet","id":"bullet-2","symbol":"blt","description":"Our team has developed a multi-chain trading platform with unrivaled features that will level the playing field for common investors in the DeFi market. In the frequently cutthroat economy of Decentralized Finance, the ordinary investor faces various difficulties. These include a lack of early information about new projects, insufficient data on the safety of investing in tokens at an early stage, the inability to monitor investments 24 hours a day, seven days a week to protect against rug pulls, and a lack of investment tools that successfully compete with professional snipers and crypto whales. We aim to break down these obstacles by providing a suite of integrated trading services to our users, allowing them to make faster, safer, and smarter trades, increasing their chances of profit. We are an experienced team of professionals dedicated to changing the way DeFi is done, undoing the damage brought across diverse blockchain ecosystems by dishonest developers, and restoring investor confidence in decentralized finance. The envisioned trading platform is being built to provide cross-chain services, with the goal of leveling the playing field for all decentralized finance players. It has features that protect investors and equip them to trade more intelligently, with greater market awareness. Because of the fast loss of trust in the DeFi space, we decided to create a platform that would allow all investors to use the same investment tools. TradersClub.App will provide access to the following tools: 1. The BULLET SNIPER – for a fast and safe entry or exit 2. The Wallet Guardian – keep your assets safe from rug pulls of any kind 3. Trading Platform – trade with lowest fees and have access to buy/sell orders(just like trading on a CEX) 4. Telegram bot for scraping launches 5. Copy trades – similar to CEXes or other trading platforms 6. Untraceable trades – for those that want to make sure bots can’t copy 7. Alerts 8. AnonFinance – loose trace of a wallet’s funds 9. Launchpad – fair or stealth","links":"https://tradersclub.app","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bullet-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x13c944ef30a2b9b1e4d5cfcec65411278b7b7524"}}}
