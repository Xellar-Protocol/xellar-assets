{"name":"The Pablo","id":"the-pablo-token","symbol":"pablo","description":"The Pablo Token makes use of Deflationary and Redistribution mechanisms to mitigate the downward price volatility that is generally associated with cryptocurrencies. Using mechanisms such as burning and buy backs, tokens are consistently removed from the total supply, thereby increasing the value of the remaining tokens. The scarcer Pablo Token becomes, the higher its desirability in the market; there will never be more Pablo Tokens in circulation than there are today. There is a 11% total tax on every transaction; 2% for marketing wallet, 2% for reflexion rewards, 2% added back into the liquidity pool as BNB, 2% charity wallet, 2% burned, and 1% for the “equalizer” wallet that will be used to buy tokens and burn them to combat selling pressure. The Pablo Token believes in “paying it forward” and giving back at the grassroots level. We achieve this by holding regular giveaways and supporting those that need it most. Come and be a part of something bigger than yourself with The Pablo Token!","links":"https://thepablotoken.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/the-pablo-token/logo.png"}
