{"name":"AI.COM","id":"ai-com_ethereum","symbol":"ai.com","description":"AI.com is a meme token inspired by Elon Musk's aquisition of the domain name AI.com which used to be owned by OpenAI. Elon Musk’s new AI startup xAI now redirects to the AI.com domain, which just recently was the home of OpenAI's ChatGPT. AI.com now sends users to a page announcing xAI. The site outlines the new startup’s formation. No confirmation has been given by either Musk or X (formerly Twitter) that a deal for the domain took place. OpenAI had only purchased the domain from Google some five months prior. No official amount of how much OpenAI paid for the domain was disclosed. However, speculation online pointed to a sum of $11 million. XAI also uses the domain x.ai. Dynadot is listed as the registrar for the domain, with x.ai registered since December 2017. WHOIS data on the domain only reveals the owners as being based in San Mateo, some 20 minutes away from the X headquarters in San Francisco.
