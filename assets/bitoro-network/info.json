{"name":"Bitoro Network","id":"bitoro-network","symbol":"btoro","description":"Bitoro Network is a perpetuals DEX that aggregates its orderbook liquidity from top liquidity layers and ecosystems such as Orderly Network and Injective. We offer a cross-chain, gasless trading experience with CEX-like speed and UI/UX, with low-latency APIs for institutions. The next step in our evolution, which is well underway, is Bitoro’s own chain and composable liquidity layer built in partnership with ZKsync – this will complement our existing liquidity hub with the introduction of options and prediction markets. We foresee this becoming a highly utilized chain with other aggregators who want to seamlessly plug into Bitoro’s native liquidity in both perps and these new markets across crypto and RWAs. Bitoro also offers automated trading strategies via its integration with Alertatron and will also be rolling out AI enhanced strats, integrated bots and copy trading in the coming months. Bitoro’s platform and solutions address the issues around fragmented liquidity by creating a unified entry point to the entire onchain derivatives market, as well as offering access to more trading pairs than any single DEX, including RWAs.","links":"https://bitoro.network","market_cap":349397,"market_cap_rank":4001,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bitoro-network/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb6212b633c941e9be168c4b9c2d9e785f1cd42fb"}}}
