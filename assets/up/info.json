{"name":"UP","id":"up","symbol":"up","description":"TonUP is a launchpad operating on The Open Network (TON), a high-performance Proof-of-Stake (PoS) public blockchain initially proposed by the Telegram team. Designed to bridge the asset gap in TON, TonUP provides a nurturing environment for new projects to thrive. The platform's decision to build on TON stems from its potential and unique offerings, such as its technical structure, which includes the low-level FunC programming language and advanced sharding technology. This foundation allows TonUP to benefit from TON's impressive Transactions Per Second (TPS) capabilities, supporting large-scale applications and fostering a decentralized ecosystem.","links":"https://tonup.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/up/logo.png","detail_platform":{"the-open-network":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"EQCvaf0JMrv6BOvPpAgee08uQM_uRpUd__fhA7Nm8twzvbE_"}}}
