{"name":"Aurora Ventures","id":"aurora-ventures_solana","symbol":"aura","description":"$Aura is a decentralized, community-owned platform creating iconic eco stays and hospitality experiences worldwide. Our first build is a one-of-a-kind glass and wood retreat in Guayabo, Costa Rica, with panoramic views of Miravalles Volcano. By holding $Aura tokens, users can own a piece of real-world properties, receive a share of profits, and vote on major project decisions. We will then expand to larger decentralized resorts and eventually a full aquisition fund and decentralized trust.","links":"https://www.aurabnb.io","market_cap":2619.89,"market_cap_rank":12977,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/aurora-ventures/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"3YmNY3Giya7AKNNQbqo35HPuqTrrcgT9KADQBM2hDWNe","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/3YmNY3Giya7AKNNQbqo35HPuqTrrcgT9KADQBM2hDWNe"}},"is_native":false}
