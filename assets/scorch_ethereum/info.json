{"name":"SCORCH","id":"scorch_ethereum","symbol":"scorch","description":"SCORCH is a platform that helps reduce the supply of cryptocurrency tokens in a clear and trackable way. Its main purpose is to let users, communities, and project owners burn tokens through public events where everything is recorded on the blockchain. These events include leaderboards, rewards, and different ways to take part, making the burn process engaging and open to everyone, not just the project teams. SCORCH also offers other important features. Users can stake their SCORCH tokens to earn rewards or take part in decisions about how the platform grows. Staking can be done directly or by providing liquidity, which supports trading activity and helps remove more tokens from circulation. This system supports long-term value and encourages people to stay involved. SCORCH will also be used inside two upcoming games, Altcoin Arena and Hunt. In these games, players can earn SCORCH by winning matches, completing challenges, and joining special events. This gives SCORCH real use beyond just buying and holding the token. All actions on the platform, including burning and staking, are handled by smart contracts on Ethereum. The platform also uses Shibarium to reduce fees and make everything more efficient. SCORCH is designed to be the go-to solution for any token project that wants to manage its supply, grow its community, and build long-term value.","links":"https://www.scorchtoken.com","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/scorch_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6b2e4f25fa8d8c9a0c77477de50c166147bd891d","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x6b2e4f25fa8d8c9a0c77477de50c166147bd891d"}},"is_native":false}
