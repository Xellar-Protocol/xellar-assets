{"name":"ChirpPad","id":"chirppad","symbol":"chpd","description":"ChirpPad is a SocialFi launchpad with a deflationary token model, that combines funding, and a unique protocol for social monitoring. Participants earn allocation through wallet scans or by completing social tasks across TikTok, Instagram, and X, driving both financial support, and viral community growth prior and post TGE. A UNIQUE APPROACH TO INVESTOR ALLOCATION - INVESTMENT-BASED ALLOCATION (50%) Wallet Scan Tiers Participants are carefully evaluated through Wallet Scan Tiers (Unchained, Bronze, Silver, and Gold), with each level offering progressively larger allocation shares determined by their contributions. The tiered allocation system will require users to lock up (stake) native $CHPD tokens for a specific duration. However, the Unchained tier is an exception, as it does not require token staking but still provides multiple ways to increase the allocation size. SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT ALLOCATION (50%) Automated Social Task Completion Users complete tasks on TikTok, Instagram, and X, with actions tracked through Chirpley’s automated system. Engagement Scoring System Each engagement activity (shares, likes, comments, posts) earns points, creating a Dynamic Engagement Score. Dynamic Allocation Tiers Users’ Engagement Scores determine allocation percentage, where higher effort and result on social participation yields larger allocation rewards. Performance Multiplier Users who consistently complete tasks at a high level (e.g., frequent posts, high engagement) earn allocation boosts.","links":"https://chirppad.ai","market_cap":90194,"market_cap_rank":7631,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/chirppad/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf2e244d4020c182e8e2c936d4055e3f0e578064f","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xf2e244d4020c182e8e2c936d4055e3f0e578064f"}}}
