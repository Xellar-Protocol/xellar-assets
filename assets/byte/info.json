{"name":"Byte","id":"byte","symbol":"byte","description":"Byte ($BYTE) is a novel ERC meme token that creatively intertwines the worlds of cryptocurrency and popular culture. Inspired by Elon Musk's announcement of naming his dog \"Byte\" in reference to his Grok AI project, this token playfully adopts the concept of \"Grok's dog\" as its mascot and theme. Distinctively, $BYTE stands out in the crypto space due to its zero-tax policy, a feature that is increasingly appealing to many investors. Additionally, it upholds the principles of transparency and investor trust by having its liquidity permanently burned and the contract ownership renounced. This ensures that $BYTE remains a community-driven project, with its fate firmly in the hands of its holders. The combination of a playful theme, investor-friendly policies, and a nod to a tech icon makes $BYTE an intriguing addition to the meme token ecosystem.","links":"https://www.byte-erc.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/byte/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xde342a3e269056fc3305f9e315f4c40d917ba521"}}}
