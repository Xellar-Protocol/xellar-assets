{"name":"Upsorber","id":"upsorber","symbol":"up","description":"upsorber aims to be a better store of value through improved game-theory. It allows holders to upsorb (stake) value. In contrast to normal staking, the amount of staking rewards that are paid out is correlated to a function of time that grows super-linearly with the stake length. This means that the protocol incentives holding the token longterm and delaying gratification.","links":"https://upsorber.com","market_cap":10294.04,"market_cap_rank":5748,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/upsorber/logo.png","detail_platform":{"tezos":{"decimal_place":0,"contract_address":"KT1TgmD7kXQzofpuc9VbTRMdZCS2e6JDuTtc"}}}
