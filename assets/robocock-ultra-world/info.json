{"name":"Robocock Ultra World","id":"robocock-ultra-world","symbol":"gken","description":"Robocock Ultra World Uprising is a Revolutionary Play-To-Earn NFT Cockfighting Game that features mecha versions of Cockerels and Hens called Robococks and Robohens. Each player may choose their desired Robocock in order to play, train, breed, bet, as well as compete with the other players. Robocock UWU aims to offer a fair and balanced gameplay and ecosystem for its players and community. This goal coincides with the projectâ€™s mission to be able to provide a world-class, income-generating and sustainable Play-To-Earn NFT game to date. NFTs inside the game are very limited and there are a lot of burning mechanisms embedded. The game provides a number of ways to earn while it also includes the usual cockfighter activities such as breeding, training, pitting, and betting, resulting in a surreal gaming experience within the NFT universe. What makes Robocock UWU at par with other games is that players will enjoy playing the game itself because of its world-class 3D graphics, skill-based tekken-like gameplay, streamable content and multiple gaming modes. And now, with the addition of NFT-gaming technology as well as Integrated Scholarship System and AI Generated Betting System, Robocock UWU will revolutionize the traditional cockfighting game as we have never seen before.","links":"https://www.robocockuwu.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/robocock-ultra-world/logo.png"}
