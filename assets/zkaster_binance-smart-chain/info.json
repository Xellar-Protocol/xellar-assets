{"name":"zkAster","id":"zkaster_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"zkaster","description":"zkAster is a privacy-first crypto exchange and settlement layer that brings zero-knowledge technology to everyday users. It begins as a simple, fixed-rate swap platform and progressively evolves into a fully private payment system powered by advanced zero-knowledge proofs. The mission is to make on-chain privacy accessible, practical, and seamless — not something only technical users can benefit from. Today, zkAster offers a clean, modern interface where users can swap assets at fixed rates, track orders, and manage saved items in a personal vault. The system is architected with strict privacy safeguards: no private keys are ever stored, the backend functions as a thin proxy so it cannot reconstruct user identities, and only minimal, short-lived metadata is retained. Every design choice follows a privacy-by-default principle. As the protocol evolves, zkAster integrates zero-knowledge mechanisms such as commitments, nullifiers, stealth addresses, and zk-conditioned escrow. These features enable private transfers, unlinkable payments, and selective disclosure — allowing users to prove what is necessary without revealing their full history. The roadmap brings zkAster from a simple swap tool to an end-to-end privacy settlement layer that supports private transactions, programmable escrow, and compliance-friendly view-key systems. zkAster is designed for two audiences: everyday users who want frictionless, low-fee swaps today, and privacy-focused users who want full anonymity for future transfers. It also supports builders who need auditable yet private infrastructure for payments and escrow. Ultimately, zkAster aims to deliver a mainstream-ready privacy experience where transactions are fast, secure, and confidential — giving users full control over what they reveal and to whom.","links":"https://www.zkaster.com/","market_cap":17253.97,"market_cap_rank":10053,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/zkaster/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x83094ecef16971cd09092aa7cdd7f90ded2e4444","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x83094ecef16971cd09092aa7cdd7f90ded2e4444"}},"is_native":false}
