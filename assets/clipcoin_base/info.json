{"name":"ClipCoin","id":"clipcoin_base","symbol":"clipcoin","description":"The InfoFi platform that tokenizes YouTube KOLs' videos into tradable assets. What we are building: tokenize whitelisted YouTube clips so conviction can be traded and benefits flow to the people who create and grow attention. Lifecycle: Whitelist creator/channel → badge. Create token from a clip → set symbol, pick creator allocation (up to 50%), optional pre‑buy. List & discover on app.clipcoin.fun → Home/Rankings drive traffic. Trade & track via Token page (chart, trades, social). Earn & claim — 1% fee per trade splits: referrer earns 20% of referrals' trading fee; creator 5% of fees on their clips → claimable on‑chain. Benefit snapshots: Trader — earlier entries via social signals; low Base fees; portable liquidity. Creator — recurring fee share + allocation without launching a platform token. Referrer — simple link → compounding on‑chain accrual.","links":"https://clipcoin.fun/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/clipcoin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe42264d3470e2fdd6ec3e288ad57cf254865a941","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xe42264d3470e2fdd6ec3e288ad57cf254865a941"}},"is_native":false}
