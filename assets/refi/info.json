{"name":"Reimagined Finance","id":"refi","symbol":"refi","description":"Reimagined Finance (ReFi) allocates capital across the best performing DeFi yield farms, staking, and rebase projects across multiple chains and returns profits back to ReFi token holders. The ReFi token provides access to dividend payouts, governance, and is designed with incentized tokenomics via transaction taxes that allocates capital towards the treasury and reflections for token holders. 10% tax is applied to every on-chain buy and sell transaction with 4% allocated to the treasury, 3% reflection in ETH, and 3% towards the ReFi/ETH Uniswap LP. ReFi’s goal is to make it easier for everyone to be able to start earning passive income through DeFi, without the complexities. ReFi’s capital allocation across blockchains and DeFi protocols relies on a portfolio that diversifies risk across 3 different low, medium, to high risk buckets. Profits from these capital allocations are periodically collected and returned back to ReFi token holders. ReFi was a fair token launch from the beginning with no pre-funding rounds or discounts offered to any investors.","links":"https://www.reimagined.fi/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/refi/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa808b22ffd2c472ad1278088f16d4010e6a54d5f"},"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xde734047952e178450237948cdf2ca7f24c37ad5"}}}
