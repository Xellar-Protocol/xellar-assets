{"name":"DAV Network","id":"dav","symbol":"dav","description":"DAV is an open source software platform that allows anyone to buy or sell autonomous transportation services in a decentralized market. DAV integrates into any autonomous vehicle (car, drone, ship), enabling those vehicles to discover, communicate, and transact with one another using a digital currency called the DAV token. This shapes a decentralized manned transportation network today and is the underlying infrastructure for an autonomous transportation network tomorrow. DAV will be a protocol that connects vehicles and users, which indeed enables a decentralized transportation market, aimed both at people and vehicle companies, and the Team is already in advanced discussions with companies in the fields of drones, robotics, and automotive.","links":"https://dav.network/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dav/logo.png"}
