{"name":"SolBox","id":"solbox","symbol":"solbox","description":"SolBox is a next-gen decentralized cloud storage platform built on Solana. With client-side AES-256 encryption, it shards files into multiple encrypted pieces that are distributed across a global node network for maximum redundancy and privacy. Immutable on-chain references and automated smart contracts guarantee censorship-resistance, tamper-proof storage, and verifiable access control. True data ownership means you—and only you—control the encryption keys and permissions, ensuring your files stay private, secure, and fully under your authority.","links":"https://solbox.cloud","market_cap":2474296,"market_cap_rank":2661,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/solbox/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"8a5NY9MAdY3NjKsgPUYfqoZcmGKdZkotrjWgZM1dpump"}}}
