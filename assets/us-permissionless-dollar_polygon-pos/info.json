{"name":"US Permissionless Dollar","id":"us-permissionless-dollar_polygon-pos","symbol":"uspd","description":"USPD (US Permissionless Dollar) is a decentralized stablecoin protocol. Its purpose is to provide a stable, censorship-resistant digital dollar that is fully backed by on-chain collateral. Users mint USPD by depositing staked Ethereum (stETH) and in return receive a stablecoin that also earns a native, passive yield from the underlying staking rewards. The protocol's stability is maintained by a decentralized network of actors, ensuring it remains permissionless and aligned with the core principles of DeFi.","links":"https://uspd.io","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/us-permissionless-dollar/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x476ef9ac6d8673e220d0e8bc0a810c2dc6a2aa84","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/polygon_pos/tokens/0x476ef9ac6d8673e220d0e8bc0a810c2dc6a2aa84"}},"is_native":false}
