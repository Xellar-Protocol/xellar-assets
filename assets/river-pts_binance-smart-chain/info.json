{"name":"River Pts","id":"river-pts_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"river pts","description":"River Pts are the ecosystem points of the River Protocol — a chain-abstraction stablecoin system that connects liquidity across ecosystems. River Pts represent participation and contribution rights within the River economy and can be dynamically converted into $RIVER tokens. The system introduces the world’s first Dynamic Airdrop Conversion, where time directly affects conversion ratio and market value. This turns airdrops into a live, behavior-driven market, aligning user activity, liquidity, and token distribution in real time.","links":"https://app.river.inc/","market_cap":1586404,"market_cap_rank":3210,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/river-pts/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xfc6be825925b7a83d131e33b46efef9084f0e014","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xfc6be825925b7a83d131e33b46efef9084f0e014"}},"is_native":false}
