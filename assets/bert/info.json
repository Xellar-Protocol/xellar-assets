{"name":"Bert","id":"bert","symbol":"bert","description":"$BERT is your favourite lore coin on Ink. Named by the founder Andrew Koller at the genesis stage, BERT is a symbol of the Ink team, and now the Ink community. $BERT was launched fairly on Inkypump and is the first and original $BERT on Ink. We are committed to remaining an integral part of Ink culture. As an OG of Ink lore, BERT never went away and now he's here to stay! Our future goals are to strengthen our community, develop connections with the Ink team, run contests and rewards programs. And eventually become the #1 community on Ink.","links":"https://www.bertonink.com","market_cap":70905,"market_cap_rank":7987,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bert/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ink":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x62c99fac20b33b5423fdf9226179e973a8353e36","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/ink/tokens/0x62c99fac20b33b5423fdf9226179e973a8353e36"}}}
