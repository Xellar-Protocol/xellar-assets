{"name":"Radial Finance","id":"radial-finance","symbol":"rdl","description":"Radial is a Convex-inspired yield maximization protocol for Solidly which enables LPs to receive boosted rewards while eliminating the need to lock veSOLID themselves. In addition to optimizing for gas (albeit being a small amount on Fantom), managing proportion of SOLID locked to optimally boost yields and promote favourable gauges â€” the protocol acts as a focal point of coordination between LPs, DAOs/protocols and various veSOLID lockers.","links":"https://www.radialfinance.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/radial-finance/logo.png","detail_platform":{"fantom":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x79360af49edd44f3000303ae212671ac94bb8ba7"}}}
