{"name":"Dotblox","id":"dotblox","symbol":"dtbx","description":"DOTBLOX Blockchain emerges as a revolutionary technological entity, epitomizing innovation in the realm of blockchain technology. Developed over a Layer 1 EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) chain, this blockchain manifests robustness, granting a seamless, secure, and versatile platform to its user base. It intertwines a plethora of advanced features designed to establish a holistic ecosystem that converges decentralization, scalability, and interoperability. The native coin of DOTBLOX, DTBX, serves as the lifeline, fueling transactions, and enabling interactions within the network. It represents intrinsic value and holds substantial significance in maintaining the equilibrium of the DOTBLOX ecosystem. The Layer 1 EVM chain upon which DOTBLOX is built reinforces the network's ability to facilitate Smart Contracts, allowing a spectrum of decentralized applications (dApps) to thrive within its ecosystem. These applications range across various domains, including finance, healthcare, and supply chain, underscoring the versatility of DOTBLOX. The integration of EVM compatibility ensures that DOTBLOX is not secluded but instead enjoys extensive interoperability with various other blockchains, fostering a collaborative environment that enriches the overall blockchain space. The robust architecture of DOTBLOXâ€™s blockchain is particularly emphasized by its scalability solutions, enabling high-throughput transactions while maintaining minimal fees and reducing latency, thus cultivating an environment conducive to widespread adoption and user-friendly experiences.","links":"https://dotblox.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dotblox/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
