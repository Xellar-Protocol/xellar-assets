The Sats Hunters has developed a protocol containing the ability to scan any wallet, locate and inscribe any satoshi you may own in your personal wallet. As a holder of a Sats Hunters inscription, you can be a part of this adventure and share in the forgotten monumental events of Bitcoin's past. The collection offers a range of benefits and utilities, making it an attractive collection for crypto enthusiasts. Sats Hunters token information: $SHNT BRC-20 token is the native token for the Sats Hunters ordinal collection. The $SHNT token is a payment and deflationary token which allows anyone to participate in our weekly auctions for inscribed rare, cultural or historical Satoshis. The $SHNT token will also be a form of payment for our public inscription service tool once it is fully developed. All payments and proceedings in $SHNT will be burned forever making the token deflationary at nature.","links":"https://www.satshunters.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/sats-hunters/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ordinals":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"4f54d82160bf08bab83bbe89276b2fd9bed514ce843c91a796daa07bafb85239i0"},"stacks":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"SP3K8BC0PPEVCV7NZ6QSRWPQ2JE9E5B6N3PA0KBR9.brc20-shnt"}}}
