{"name":"Crypto Royale","id":"crypto-royale","symbol":"roy","description":"Crypto Royale is a browser-based, free-to-play, play-to-earn game in which players compete for fame, glory and a little profit. Last man standing wins crypto. No up-front investment. No downloads. No signups. Get into a game in 30 seconds and win! The game is purposefully designed to be simple to play yet difficult to master. Every day 1000+ players congregate on the battlefield as they fight to see who can survive and claim the game’s HRC-20 token – ROY. Players enter a battlefield where they must be ‘the last person standing’. Represented by moons, a player’s ‘character’ can be one of three colours (Yellow, Pink, Blue). Colours are interchangeable by collecting boxes dropped onto the battlefield and must be used to ensure a player’s strength over an opponent in an effort to outsmart, outwit and out manoeuvre other players to become the victor. The game allows for each player to adopt a style of their own, and often becomes an identifiable trait/signature of said player. Whatever a player and opponents’ strategy there is a continual external force adding pressure to the gameplay – a closing circle. Venturing outside into the darkness causes a deterioration in health, but the collectables outside can, and often do, provide the weapons needed to claim victory. Positioning and timing are critical components to a player’s skill set.","links":"https://cryptoroyale.one","market_cap":163403,"market_cap_rank":4591,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/crypto-royale/logo.png","detail_platform":{"harmony-shard-0":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xfe1b516a7297eb03229a8b5afad80703911e81cb"},"avalanche":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x68ee0d0aad9e1984af85ca224117e4d20eaf68be"},"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x68ee0d0aad9e1984af85ca224117e4d20eaf68be"}}}
