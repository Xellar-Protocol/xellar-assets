{"name":"Boosted LUSD","id":"boosted-lusd","symbol":"blusd","description":"Chicken Bonds is a novel bonding mechanism to acquire protocol-owned liquidity (POL) for Liquity in a permissionless way. At the same time, it offers an amplified yield-earning and trading opportunity for LUSD holders. Chicken Bonds gamifies the LUSD Stability Pool yield by combining game-theoretic plays with Dynamic NFTs. These NFTs are a new and innovative concept as they change their visual representation based on the user's bonding actions and can be only acquired by participating in Chicken Bonds.","links":"https://www.chickenbonds.org/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/boosted-lusd/logo.png"}
