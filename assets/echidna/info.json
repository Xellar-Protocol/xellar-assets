{"name":"Echidna","id":"echidna","symbol":"ecd","description":"Echidna Finance is the ultimate yield boosting protocol for Platypus Finance, Avalanche's native stableswap. We aggregate the Platypus token (PTP) from the community to build a vePTP (voting escrow PTP) treasury that anyone can leverage to boost their stablecoin yields. PTP contributors are rewarded with extra liquidity and income via our native ECD token. As a yield booster, Echidna emulates the simplicity and innovation that made Platypus Finance successful. We simplify and amplify yield farming on Platypus with: + Straightforward liquidity mining rewards distribution + PTP Flywheel tokenomics that are non-dilutive + Intuitive UI and quality of life upgrades The ECD token will give holders voting power over Platypus' voting gauge, similar to how CVX functions with CRV. Once Platypus voting gauges are enabled, Echidna will integrate voting power monetization into the dApp so that users can generate more income from our token.","links":"https://www.echidna.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/echidna/logo.png","detail_platform":{"avalanche":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xeb8343d5284caec921f035207ca94db6baaacbcd"}}}
