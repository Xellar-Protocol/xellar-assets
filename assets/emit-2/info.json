{"name":"EMIT","id":"emit-2","symbol":"emit","description":"EMIT is a next-gen yield farming protocol on PulseChain, merging classic emissions with reflection token mechanics. Stake LP tokens to earn daily emissions, or single-sided stake EMIT to earn stable tokens from the 4% fee on EMIT transactions. With dual incentives, EMIT empowers users to capture yield through farming or fee-driven staking for sustainable DeFi rewards. EMIT is the premier yield farming experience on PulseChain and is truly an innovation improving upon the classic yield farming experience.","links":"https://emit.farm","market_cap":141664,"market_cap_rank":6938,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/emit-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"pulsechain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x32fb5663619a657839a80133994e45c5e5cdf427","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/pulsechain/tokens/0x32fb5663619a657839a80133994e45c5e5cdf427"}}}
