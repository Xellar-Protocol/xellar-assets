{"name":"Real Estate Crypto Crowfunding","id":"real-estate-crypto-crowfunding_solana","symbol":"recc","description":"RECC is a Solana-native protocol that tokenises real-world real-estate financing and lets investors lend stablecoins to vetted development projects. Acting as a crowdfunding intermediary, it matches KYB-verified property developers (“sellers”) with crypto or fiat investors (“buyers”) who seek predictable yield . When a project is approved, a smart contract opens a dedicated project pool, accepts the pledged USDC/USDT and mints an LP token that represents each investor’s share; once the funding goal is met, the capital is lent to the developer, and upon repayment investors burn the LP token to reclaim principal plus interest . Initial opportunities advertise estimated annual returns between 6 % and 18 %, reflecting the risk-adjusted cash-flows of each underlying asset . Road-mapped utilities include multi-chain and fiat on-ramp support, a secondary trading venue for LP tokens, a referral and insurance programme, and optional auto-roll of proceeds into new pools, widening access and liquidity for real-world-asset yield on Solana .","links":"https://recc.finance","market_cap":480952,"market_cap_rank":4645,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/real-estate-crypto-crowfunding_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"3SkjMkrpkqngCCMd3sVU2EuKMVRLTfHEykbzTyrVwBLV","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/3SkjMkrpkqngCCMd3sVU2EuKMVRLTfHEykbzTyrVwBLV"}},"is_native":false}
