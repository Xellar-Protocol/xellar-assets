{"name":"Alitas","id":"alitas","symbol":"alt","description":"Alitas is the underlying infrastructure of a new generation of value networks, dedicated to building a new generation of underlying trusted network protocols, and providing efficient, convenient, secure, and stable development and deployment environments to customers worldwide. Break the traditional chain structure and design a new consensus mechanism on Alitas. While achieving complete decentralization and absolute security, it breaks through performance bottlenecks, and TPS can reach 30,000+ per second. Alitas pioneered the Tolerance Algorithm and Star Drop effect. The tolerance algorithm is used to replace consensus to solve data consistency. Through the original Alitas structure, the included nodes can obtain legal transaction references, realizing complete decentralization. Randomness like the star drop, introduces nodes to obtain the legitimacy of the transaction. Realize high security of transaction privacy.","links":"https://alitas.tech/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/alitas/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x5ca09af27b8a4f1d636380909087536bc7e2d94d"}}}
