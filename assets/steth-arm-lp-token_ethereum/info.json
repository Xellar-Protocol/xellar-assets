{"name":"stETH ARM LP Token","id":"steth-arm-lp-token_ethereum","symbol":"arm-weth-steth","description":"The Origin Lido ARM is a vault that purchases Lido's stETH when it goes below its ETH peg and puts it through Lido's redeem queue to earn an arbitrage profit. The ETH is then recycled back to purchase more stETH. If purchasing stETH below peg is not possible, the vault lends the ETH to a Morpho market to earn a baseline yield. Since its inception, the Lido ARM has handled almost $2 billion in volume. Developed by the team at Origin Protocol.","links":"https://docs.originprotocol.com/arm/steth-arm","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/steth-arm-lp-token_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x85b78aca6deae198fbf201c82daf6ca21942acc6","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x85b78aca6deae198fbf201c82daf6ca21942acc6"}},"is_native":false}
