{"name":"Smart Pocket","id":"smart-pocket_solana","symbol":"sp","description":"$SP is the base currency of Smart Pocket. It connects once-scattered IP token economies into one. Every token issued on MemePad ends its contract address with the shared “SP” tag. It signals clear membership in Smart Pocket and a direct link to $SP—reinforcing legitimacy and brand unity. The fragmentation problem—thin liquidity, inconvenient swaps, isolated economies. Anchoring to $SP solves it all at once. Through $SP, each token gains interchangeability and shared liquidity. Value circulates across the ecosystem, and users move seamlessly among multiple IP economies on one platform. Believe in $SP. Believe in IP.","links":"https://www.smapocke.app","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/smart-pocket/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"6gdDALVM7FrTnXTXo17PpHnLtUdnaAtokCBzPUZKA2rx","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/6gdDALVM7FrTnXTXo17PpHnLtUdnaAtokCBzPUZKA2rx"}},"is_native":false}
