{"name":"Notional Finance","id":"notional-finance_ethereum","symbol":"note","description":"Notional is the first decentralized, Ethereum-based protocol for borrowing and lending at fixed rates and fixed terms. With variable rate lending, DeFi can only serve a small segment of the crypto lending market because variable interest rates don’t provide the certainty that lenders and borrowers require. Notional fixes this by creating a true market for lenders and borrowers that democratizes and empowers individual investors, business owners and institutional investors. Right now, users can borrow or lend USDC & DAI for up to one year, and ETH & WBTC for up to six months from Notional's on-chain liquidity pools. With Notional's V2 upgrade, liquidity providers enjoy a low-touch experience, and no longer need to roll their debts to new maturities as it is done automatically through the use of nTokens, ERC20 tokens that represent a user's share of the liquidity pool. After raising a $10 million Series A in May 2021 from some of the top VC firms, including Coinbase Ventures, Notional’s protocol has been relaunched on 11/1 with a host of new features as well as the NOTE governance token.","links":"https://notional.finance/","market_cap":398952,"market_cap_rank":4902,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/notional-finance_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"0xcfeaead4947f0705a14ec42ac3d44129e1ef3ed5","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xcfeaead4947f0705a14ec42ac3d44129e1ef3ed5"}},"is_native":false}
