Cerebrum DAO will be supporting the development of near- and long-term solutions for targeting cognitive decline, memory loss and neurodegenerative diseases. The global market for brain health supplements is over $8.6b - most if not all lack clinical evidence to support efficacy. Percepta® has robust patent protection and highly promising research results. Percepta has the potential to be the category leader in this fast growing $8.6b market with human evidence to support outcomes and the funding of future studies that could lead to FDA botanical drug status which is the ultimate goal. This IP-NFT represents a world’s first tokenization of a robust patent portfolio and a world’s first tokenized crowdsale for a clinical evidence study. Success with this study can lead to future trials that create the potential for FDA botanical drug approval, potentially unlocking broad access to improve brain health globally.","links":"https://www.cerebrumdao.com/projects/percepta-brain","market_cap":219017,"market_cap_rank":5779,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ip-tokens-of-ipnft-129_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x93757336de76f24f7eee15e6150e4ec42fbdaa21","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x93757336de76f24f7eee15e6150e4ec42fbdaa21"}},"is_native":false}
