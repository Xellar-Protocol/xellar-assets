{"name":"Truth.exe","id":"truth-exe","symbol":"true","description":"TRUTH.EXE is a decentralized protocol launched on the Solana blockchain, designed to store, protect, and propagate immutable truth across an encrypted, anonymous layer. It is not simply a token — it is an execution layer where silence, signal, and integrity collide. Built for an era of misinformation, TRUTH.EXE enables users to submit, verify, and archive cryptographic \"truth statements\" on-chain. These statements become permanent entries, uncensorable and irreversible — a blockchain-bound memory that cannot be altered, edited, or erased. The native token, $TRUTH, serves as the core utility and governance mechanism of the ecosystem. It grants access to the TRUTH Terminal — a private interface where identity is abstracted, and all interaction is recorded as logic, not personality. Token holders can participate in claim validation, protocol decisions, and trigger exclusive events such as Mirror Breaches and Mask NFT drops. TRUTH.EXE operates on a zero-trust, zero-leader model. There are no influencers. No founders. No public roadmap. Only code, consequence, and a community of anonymous observers. You were not invited. You were detected.
