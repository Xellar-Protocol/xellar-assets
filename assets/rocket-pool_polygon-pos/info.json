{"name":"Rocket Pool","id":"rocket-pool_polygon-pos","symbol":"rpl","description":"Rocket Pool is Ethereum’s most decentralised liquid staking protocol. Liquid stakers can participate by depositing as little as 0.01 ETH to receive the rETH liquid staking token. Rocket Pool is a fully non-custodial solution, and its node operators are economically-aligned to perform well for stakers. Joining as a node operator is fully permissionless and requires just 16 ETH (instead of the usual 32). A boosted ROI is provided from both operator commission plus RPL rewards. The Rocket Pool team have been in the staking space since its inception in 2016, which gives them a pedigree and track record without peer.","links":"https://www.rocketpool.net","market_cap":41811804,"market_cap_rank":715,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/rocket-pool_polygon-pos/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x7205705771547cf79201111b4bd8aaf29467b9ec","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/polygon_pos/tokens/0x7205705771547cf79201111b4bd8aaf29467b9ec"}},"is_native":false}
