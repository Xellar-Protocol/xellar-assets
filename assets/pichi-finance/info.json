{"name":"Pichi Finance","id":"pichi-finance","symbol":"pch","description":"Pichi Finance is a trustless points trading protocol that leverages on the ERC-6551 standard, to allow price discovery on tokens Pre and Post-TGE. The ERC-6551 allows for NFTs minted in Pichi to be treated like normal self-custodial wallets - allowing them to own assets, and even points. We are also creating a platform for users to trade vested and/or locked tokens without the need to compromise private key. They can then be traded on our marketplace trustlessly, without any collateral needed.","links":"https://pichi.finance","market_cap":145136,"market_cap_rank":5800,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pichi-finance/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xbe5acfd64358805616b5cbd5277b9a85011d7cf1"},"mantle":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xbe5acfd64358805616b5cbd5277b9a85011d7cf1"}}}
