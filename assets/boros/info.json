{"name":"Boros","id":"boros","symbol":"boros","description":"Boros is a $HYPE-backed coin on the HyperEVM ecosystem. Its purpose is to create a deflationary, yield-generating asset that rewards holders and supports the Hyperliquid ecosystem. A 5% transaction tax drives its utility: 1% is burned to reduce the 1 billion token supply, 2% is distributed gaslessly to holders as rewards, and 2% is converted to $HYPE for a treasury. This treasury invests in DeFi protocols like lending and liquidity provision, generating yield for $BOROS buybacks and burns, fostering scarcity and value growth.","links":"https://www.boros.meme","market_cap":413114,"market_cap_rank":5381,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/boros/logo.png","detail_platform":{"hyperevm":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0725a349f733cc13c84232a706d9ca99d2a1ef23","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/hyperevm/tokens/0x0725a349f733cc13c84232a706d9ca99d2a1ef23"}}}
