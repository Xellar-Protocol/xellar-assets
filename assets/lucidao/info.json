{"name":"Lucidao","id":"lucidao","symbol":"lcd","description":"Lucidao is a Decentralized Autonomous Organisation (DAO) that aims to gather a community of oracles and users to build an ecosystem that bridges crypto and real worlds. Before the initial launch Lucidao passed the quality check from two of the most renowned name in crypto-world: MME for its legal structure and PeckShield for the security of its smart contracts. Lucidao first transaction, where a total of 880.000.000 LCD tokens were minted, was processed on the 29th of December 2021. The project filled two rounds of sales in less than 20 minutes each, raising more than 1.7 million dollars. Lucidao is now recognized by the Fantom Foundation as one of the few official governance projects on the Fantom Opera Chain. The possible future developments are vast, including the creation of marketplaces, crypto gateways for products and services, e-learning platforms and consulting services for DLT/Blockchain ventures as an example. The final goal is to go beyond the common belief that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are only speculative assets, by driving mass adoption and trust through utility.","links":"https://lucidao.com","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/lucidao/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc2a45fe7d40bcac8369371b08419ddafd3131b4a"}}}
