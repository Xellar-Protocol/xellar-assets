{"name":"Lucidao","id":"lucidao","symbol":"lcd","description":"LUCIDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) with a mission to bring together a community of oracles and users to construct infrastructure that bridges the crypto and physical worlds. Rather than viewing cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology as simply speculative investments, LUCIDAO strives to promote widespread acceptance and trust through their practical applications. Established in 2021 by a group of Swiss-based entrepreneurs, developers, and marketers who share a passion for all things crypto, LUCIDAO underwent thorough security audits by Peckshield before its official launch. The organization has also partnered with MME legal to ensure ongoing development. Their inaugural dApp, Altr, is a decentralized marketplace for luxury collectibles, including watches, classic cars and wines.","links":"https://lucidao.com","market_cap":1323541,"market_cap_rank":2411,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/lucidao/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc2a45fe7d40bcac8369371b08419ddafd3131b4a"}}}
