{"name":"Cherish","id":"cherish","symbol":"chc","description":"Cherish is a place where artists are free to express themselves creatively, and capture the value their art brings to the world. This means Cherish does not moderate or sanitize our artists' creations, nor do we charge fees for the use of our social features. Whether through their feed, commissions, or shop, artists can now engage with their community in a fair and sustainable way. We ground this new creative economy on the Cherry Chain, a cutting edge layer-one blockchain network. As we iterate our technology, we aim to fully decentralize our stack and become the first truly distributed, censorship-resistant hub for cultural exploration.","links":"https://www.cherish.cx/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cherish/logo.png"}
