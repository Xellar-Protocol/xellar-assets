{"name":"StaFi Staked ATOM","id":"stafi-staked-atom","symbol":"ratom","description":"What is the project about? StaFi rATOM App is a decentralized DeFi product that unlocks the liquidity of the Cosmos token ATOM staking. What makes your project unique? rATOM app can help ATOM stakers to solve the following two problems: - There will be no need to wait for a long 21 day unbonding period to transfer or trade staked ATOM assets. rATOM App users can transfer and trade the staking voucher rATOM token at any time on Uniswap to enjoy liquidity and hedge price risks. - There is no need to learn the complicated Tendermint consensus mechanism of Cosmos and staking reward calculation rules any more. With rATOM App, users only need a few simple steps to deposit ATOM into the rATOM contract, which will automatically select the best validator by executing the Staking Reward Maximization strategy algorithm. History of your project. StaFi has launched rETH, rMATIC, rSOL, rATOM, rBNB, and other tokens to solve the liquidity problem. Whatâ€™s next for your project? What can your token be used for? rATOM can be swapped for ATOM in a DEX.","links":"https://www.stafi.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/stafi-staked-atom/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
