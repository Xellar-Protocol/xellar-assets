Spatial computing and machine perception bring AI's power to the physical world. The posemesh is a decentralized spatial computing and machine perception network for the next 100 billion people, devices and AI. Traction & Milestones - 700+ posemesh domains around the world; anyone can create their own domain by grabbing a portal kit and setting it up within minutes. We have another app called McKenna for decorating domains with NFTs, images, videos, 3D assets, and text notes. - 6+ month pilot with Coop (a major grocery retailer in Sweden) integrating spatial AI and staff productivity, saving them more than 15 minutes per employee per day and increasing their self-sufficiency. - 2+ month multi-store pilot with another major Swedish grocery retailer that has committed to doing a complete rollout in the coming 12 months, plus a number of others in Hong Kong. - Top 10 global retailers are interested in Spatial AI to do empty shelf detection and planogram compliance; theyâ€™ve also expressed strong interest in ESL positioning and realograms (having a detailed understanding of where items are in their stores). - Pre-pilot planning with more of Europe and North America's largest grocery retailers; a combined total of 40,000+ stores and hundreds of thousands of employees. - Real-time indoor navigation and friend finding at a number of large events and venues. - 40k DePIN app users on TG - 300+ DePIN servers around the world (purposely capped to avoid over-provisioning) - 450+ app developers using the posemesh SDK for building shared and persistent AR experiences","links":"https://www.posemesh.org/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/auki-labs/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf9569cfb8fd265e91aa478d86ae8c78b8af55df4"}}}
