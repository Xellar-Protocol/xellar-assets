{"name":"Sacred Tails","id":"sacred-tails","symbol":"st","description":"Sacred Tails (ST) is a PVP play-to-earn blockchain-based 3D battle game that leverages opportunities available in the gaming and the NFT sectors through a strategically planned business model. The game revolves around Shinsei which you can mint, breed and battle with. The setting of our world is a traditional Japanese village reinvented in a fantasy tone. The open world city will feature as the first of our MetaHubs where players can arrange to meet in game on the same world and battle, trade or just hang out in game. The platform introduces two main NFTs â€” Shinsei and Land Plots. ST tokenomics reward holders in our native token Sacred Tails $ST with 2%/4% rewards on buys and sells. 3% (BNB) tax goes towards marketing and development. 1% (BNB) is added to the prize pool pot for future hosted tournaments. The in-game currency Sacred Tails Spheres ($STS) will be used throughout the game and can only be purchased by swapping $ST for it. By transferring in and out of the game it will generate volume for all the holders. Players taking advantage of the play to earn element will constantly push volumes to an ever increasing level. This also gives the more passive investors a reassurance in that their investment will continue to yield high returns due to the consistent volumes generated through the game.","links":"https://www.sacredtails.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/sacred-tails/logo.png"}
