{"name":"Gaming XP USD","id":"gaming-xp-usd_avalanche","symbol":"xpusd","description":"xpUSD stablecoin, developed by The Growth Protocol, is the universal currency tailored specifically for the gaming ecosystem. It represents a transformative approach to how value flows within modern gaming. Addresses key issues in traditional gaming economies: fragmentation (rewards locked in individual games), illiquidity (no real-world value for in-game assets), and delayed financing (60+ day waits for publisher UA payouts). Solves these through three core pillars: Universal Loyalty via Fidelis Platform: Players earn Fidelis tokens across games and convert instantly to xpUSD (already 150,000+ DAU in World Cricket Championship franchise). Cross-Platform Liquidity: Asset Marketplace for trading items, skins, and NFTs in xpUSD across Steam and mobile. Instant Financing: Immediate xpUSD funding for publishers to scale campaigns without delays. Built on The Growth Protocol's gaming-optimized Layer 1 blockchain (Avalanche subnet) with low latency, minimal fees, and SDK-first developer experience. Emphasizes regulation, compliance, transparency, and seamless fiat integration for institutional standards. Proven traction with real transactions and player-earned value. Fosters a network effect: More games → more player earnings → more xpUSD holdings → more publisher financing → more game integrations. Serves as stable, programmable USD backed by actual gaming activity—the essential financial infrastructure for a unified gaming economy.","links":"https://growthprotocol.xyz","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gaming-xp-usd_avalanche/logo.png","detail_platform":{"avalanche":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0xcc18b41a0f63c67f17f23388c848aec67b583422","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/avax/tokens/0xcc18b41a0f63c67f17f23388c848aec67b583422"}},"is_native":false}
