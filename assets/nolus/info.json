{"name":"Nolus","id":"nolus","symbol":"nls","description":"Nolus is a semi-permissioned blockchain bridging lenders and borrowers in a DeFi money market. With its DeFi Lease, borrowers can secure up to 150% financing on their initial investments, and access to the underlying leveraged assets through whitelisted strategies. Inspired by traditional leasing, where one pays a fraction upfront and gains ownership after repayment, Nolus' approach cuts down the DeFi sector's high over-collateralization standards. This boosts capital efficiency and offers borrowers better loan terms.","links":"https://nolus.io/","market_cap":9635342,"market_cap_rank":1449,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nolus/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
