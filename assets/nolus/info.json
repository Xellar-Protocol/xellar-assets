{"name":"Nolus","id":"nolus","symbol":"nls","description":"Nolus is a semi-permissioned blockchain bridging lenders and borrowers in a DeFi money market. With its DeFi Lease, borrowers can secure up to 150% financing on their initial investments, and access to the underlying leveraged assets through whitelisted strategies. Inspired by traditional leasing, where one pays a fraction upfront and gains ownership after repayment, Nolus' approach cuts down the DeFi sector's high over-collateralization standards. This boosts capital efficiency and offers borrowers better loan terms.","links":"https://nolus.io/","market_cap":5228570,"market_cap_rank":2304,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nolus/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""},"osmosis":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"ibc/D9AFCECDD361D38302AA66EB3BAC23B95234832C51D12489DC451FA2B7C72782"},"neutron":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"ibc/6C9E6701AC217C0FC7D74B0F7A6265B9B4E3C3CDA6E80AADE5F950A8F52F9972"},"ethereum":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0xb34e17562e4f1f63a2d4cf684ed8bc124e519771"}}}
