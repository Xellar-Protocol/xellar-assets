{"name":"Reactive Network","id":"reactive-network","symbol":"react","description":"Reactive Network is the first parallelized interoperability execution layer, utilising a new form of smart contract we call reactive smart contracts. Reactive smart contracts are able to react to on-chain events autonomously and execute their own user defined logic to initiate new transactions.
