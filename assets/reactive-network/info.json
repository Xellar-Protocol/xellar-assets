{"name":"Reactive Network","id":"reactive-network","symbol":"react","description":"Reactive Network is the first parallelized interoperability execution layer, utilising a new form of smart contract we call reactive smart contracts. Reactive smart contracts are able to react to on-chain events autonomously and execute their own user defined logic to initiate new transactions. This allows a virtually limitless number of use cases to achieve fully decentralized on-chain automation.","links":"https://reactive.network/","market_cap":20690597,"market_cap_rank":1302,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/reactive-network/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""},"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x817162975186d4d53dbf5a7377dd45376e2d2fc5","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x817162975186d4d53dbf5a7377dd45376e2d2fc5"}}}
