The instant liquidity for NFTs can provide users a platform to trade NFTs faster than they can today. Droplets can be traded on AMMs and Serum order books on Solana. Users can trade the droplets owned by them to redeem NFTs in the Solvent buckets or swap droplets for USDC directly from the platform. They can also stake their liquidity of the droplets into liquidity pools and earn liquidity rewards.
