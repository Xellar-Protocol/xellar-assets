{"name":"Warrior Coin","id":"warrior-coin_solana","symbol":"war","description":"What Is WarriorCoin ($WAR)? WarriorCoin ($WAR) is the official utility token of the PoliticalPump.com ecosystem — a platform that mixes political commentary with the fast-moving world of meme coins. Every 72 hours, PoliticalPump.com launches a brand new meme coin paired with $WAR. These meme coins are fun, themed, and tradable — and users can buy them using any Solana-based token. When users trade these meme coins, it also increases demand and trading volume for $WAR. This creates a cycle: More meme coins = more $WAR trading = more attention = more value for $WAR. As the $WAR token is used more in meme coin pairings, its liquidity pool grows and its circulating supply drops — helping to increase its value. The more active the ecosystem becomes, the more $WAR is needed and the more valuable it gets. In short: WarriorCoin ($WAR) is what powers everything on PoliticalPump.com. It’s like the fuel that keeps the meme coin engine running — and the more people use the platform, the more powerful $WAR becomes.","links":"https://www.warriorcoin.io/","market_cap":274900,"market_cap_rank":5456,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/warrior-coin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"3fP61JWqLxxrvBv5NSxJdAz4GtCB7UpfU3UFxZTgj1yG","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/3fP61JWqLxxrvBv5NSxJdAz4GtCB7UpfU3UFxZTgj1yG"}},"is_native":false}
