{"name":"CloneX AI","id":"clonex-ai","symbol":"clx","description":"Malicious actors now have voice cloning technology at their disposal to assist in impersonation. AI-generated voice clones are being used to impersonate executives and deceive employees into transferring funds or sharing sensitive information. For instance, fraudsters recently cloned a company director's voice in a $35 million bank heist. That’s why here at Clonex, we’ve developed an AI-powered voice security platform designed to combat voice-based cyber threats. With instant voice cloning, 99.9% accurate clone detection, and advanced penetration testing, we help organisations strengthen their defenses against social engineering attacks, and prevent malicious actors from being able to deceive internal employees into believing a cloned voice, is a real one.","links":"https://www.clone-x.com/","market_cap":5817.35,"market_cap_rank":11348,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/clonex-ai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xd8a2f109bec88d9c9df6f4958c3301bd9d1929fd","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xd8a2f109bec88d9c9df6f4958c3301bd9d1929fd"}}}
