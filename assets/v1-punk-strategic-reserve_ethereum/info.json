{"name":"V1 Punk Strategic Reserve","id":"v1-punk-strategic-reserve_ethereum","symbol":"punksr","description":"V1 Punk Reserve is a fork of punkstrategy.fun, specifically designed for V1 CryptoPunks. It is an ERC-20 token that leverages Uniswap v4 hooks to perpetually accumulate and resell V1 CryptoPunks while routing protocol fees back into buybacks and ETH yield distribution. The first automated protocol that accumulates V1 CryptoPunks while rewarding stakers, forever. A 10% fee is applied to every trade and plain wallet-to-wallet transfer. Trading fees route 80% of the fee to NFT purchases and 20% to ETH staking rewards, while transfer fees are burned to permanently reduce circulating supply.","links":"https://punkreserve.com","market_cap":283504,"market_cap_rank":5401,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/v1-punk-strategic-reserve/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6b419b281491473da2948b23fcb42f80e4ef2529","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x6b419b281491473da2948b23fcb42f80e4ef2529"}},"is_native":false}
