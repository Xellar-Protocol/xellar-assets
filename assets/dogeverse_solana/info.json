The $DOGEVERSE token was launched through an ICO in Q2 2024, successfully reaching its $17 million hard cap. The DogeVerse community could purchase and claim $DOGEVERSE tokens across six different chains: ETH, BNB, POLY, BASE, SOL, and AVAX. The native base token was first deployed on Ethereum, and then Wormhole’s Portal Bridge technology was used to create tokens on the other chains. DogeVerse is tradable on various decentralized exchanges (DEX) with liquidity pools established on all supported chains.","links":"https://thedogeverse.com/en","market_cap":638342,"market_cap_rank":4273,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dogeverse_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"7xZCdhj7rGhnKndRpU3NHgZhbFMkPLP2ErDr1AS8Chsx","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/7xZCdhj7rGhnKndRpU3NHgZhbFMkPLP2ErDr1AS8Chsx"}},"is_native":false}
