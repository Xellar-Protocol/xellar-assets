{"name":"Index Cooperative","id":"index-cooperative","symbol":"index","description":"Index Coop is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that builds structured DeFi products and strategy tokens. Index Coop offers a suite of sector index products, leverage and inverse products, and yield-generating products. The product suite runs on Set Protocol, an audited, self-custodial DeFi tool that allows for the creation and management of Ethereum-based (or ERC-20) tokens. Changes to the DAO are voted on by the owners of a governance token called INDEX and then implemented by a team of developers. INDEX holders wield voting power on a 1:1 basis, meaning one token equals one vote.","links":"https://indexcoop.com/index-token","market_cap":28110324,"market_cap_rank":1236,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/index-cooperative/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0954906da0bf32d5479e25f46056d22f08464cab"},"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xfbd8a3b908e764dbcd51e27992464b4432a1132b"}}}
