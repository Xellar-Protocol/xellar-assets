{"name":"Confetti","id":"confetti","symbol":"cfti","description":"RaidParty is an on-chain idle game that exists on Ethereum. The game has two main goals: Gamify yield and adds variance to yield amounts. In RaidParty, players join The Raid: a massive dungeon in which only a single boss is present at all times. A player's \"\"party\"\" is the team they enter into the dungeon with, composed of one Hero NFT and a limited amount of Fighter NFTs. All players contribute in dealing damage with their teams to this single boss over time and are distributed $CFTI. $CFTI is used in enhancing existing NFTs and summoning (minting) new ones. $CFTI is the utility token yielded to players from the raid and can be used in various ways, such as increasing the damage of their NFT's to yield more in the Raid.","links":"https://raid.party","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/confetti/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xcfef8857e9c80e3440a823971420f7fa5f62f020"}}}
