{"name":"BetBruh.bet","id":"betbruh-bet_solana","symbol":"bruh","description":"BetBruh.bet is a viral peer-to-peer social prediction and wagering platform built directly on top of Twitter. Users can turn their tweets into bets, challenge friends, and let blockchain oracles automatically verify outcomes. No apps, no KYC, and no friction — just pure degeneracy powered by ego, engagement, and crypto rewards. Bet on markets, sports, politics, culture, or anything provable. It’s not DeFi or CeFi — it’s BruhFi, the new frontier of social betting.","links":"https://betbruh.bet/","market_cap":2828.36,"market_cap_rank":12945,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/betbruh-bet/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"A1r1SooLp5GHZoAWmY3BErwByYoCrV2StAiCEa3epump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/A1r1SooLp5GHZoAWmY3BErwByYoCrV2StAiCEa3epump"}},"is_native":false}
