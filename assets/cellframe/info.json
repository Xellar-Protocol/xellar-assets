{"name":"Cellframe","id":"cellframe","symbol":"cell","description":"Cellframe is a quantum-resistant layer-1 network focused on facilitating secure and scalable cross-chain transfers. Cellframe aims to create an infrastructure for decentralized low-level services through its multichain nature. It is quantum-safe â€” it uses post-quantum encryption by default. Cellframe is built from scratch with plain C, which results in more efficient utilization of CPU and memory.","links":"https://cellframe.net","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cellframe/logo.png"}
