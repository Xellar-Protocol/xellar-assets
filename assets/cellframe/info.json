{"name":"Cellframe","id":"cellframe","symbol":"cell","description":"Cellframe Network is a scalable, open-source, next-generation platform for building and bridging blockchains and services secured by post-quantum encryption. Cellframe offers an environment for enterprises and developers to build a vast array of products ranging from simple low-level t-dApps to whole other blockchains on top of Cellframe Network. Cellframe can provide extremely high transaction throughput based on an original sharding implementation. In addition, post-quantum cryptography makes the system resistant to hacking by quantum computers. Cellframe Network is built with a unique implementation of dual-layer sharding, conditional transactions and multiparty computations. This allows seamless interoperability, as well as fast and economical transactions, all secured by integrated quantum safety measures. Since the platform is built from scratch using plain C, t-dApps built on our SDK can be executed on anything from enterprise-level mainframes to a smart fridge, which enables developers to build a wide range of applications.","links":"https://cellframe.net","market_cap":7429644,"market_cap_rank":2030,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cellframe/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x26c8afbbfe1ebaca03c2bb082e69d0476bffe099","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x26c8afbbfe1ebaca03c2bb082e69d0476bffe099"},"cellframe":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xB1F56F4BD0C8F3F99BE753F8F223C9754C116ED593A488E2D605593F8F4956E5"},"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd98438889ae7364c7e2a3540547fad042fb24642","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xd98438889ae7364c7e2a3540547fad042fb24642"}}}
