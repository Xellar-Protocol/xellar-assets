{"name":"GemPad","id":"gempad_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"gems","description":"GemPad is a frontline protocol for users and project-owners designed to help to launch their projects and tokens in the easiest way possible. As an investor, you'll be able to browse the many presales. They have crafted an all-in-one platform, providing users with numerous features that can be used with no coding requirements. They offer a launchpad with Whitelists, Liquidity Locks, KYC, Audits along with other options as well as incubator benefits for select, especially promising projects. To easy distinguish between projects, they have come up with a system of tiers. The higher the tier, the safer and better a project is. Their tiers go from common to gold to platinum and lastly diamond. Having a system of tiers allows GemPad to be a launchpad for all projects, from the smallest ones to big and already established ones. That is why they do not only offer presales, but special sales as well. They also offer the ability to raise funds in any crypto token. Another feature on GemPad is the My Alarms function. You can set up the alarm to remind you 5, 15 or 30 minutes before the presale starts or before the launch takes place, making sure you do not miss another project again!","links":"https://gempad.app","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gempad/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x78aae7e000bf6fc98a6b717d5ec8ef2bcd04f428","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x78aae7e000bf6fc98a6b717d5ec8ef2bcd04f428"}},"is_native":false}
