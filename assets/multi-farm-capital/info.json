{"name":"Multi-Farm Capital","id":"multi-farm-capital","symbol":"mfc","description":"Multi-Farm Capital is an experimental yield farming protocol where transaction fees are collected and used to farm on multiple chains. The rewards are returned to holders. As profits accumulate in the Multi-Farm Capital Treasury, they are bridged to chains with lower gas costs and invested in yield farms and auto-compounding vaults.","links":"https://www.multifarmcapital.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/multi-farm-capital/logo.png"}
