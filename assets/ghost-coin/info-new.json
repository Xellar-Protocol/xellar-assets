{"name":"Ghost Coin","id":"ghost-coin","symbol":"ghost","description":"Ghost Coin (GHOST) is a spooky and deflationary meme token that haunts the XRP Ledger, designed to possess the hearts and minds of the anonymous crypto community. With a sinister yet limited supply of 170 million tokens, Ghost is poised to become the ultimate digital phantom, lurking in the shadowy depths of the blockchain and ready to materialize in the wallets of its die-hard fans. But Ghost is more than just a meme â€“ it's a token with a mission. In the near future, Ghost plans to integrate with automated market maker (AMM) protocols, allowing for decentralized and haunted liquidity pools that enable seamless token swaps and eerie trading experiences. Imagine a world where you can summon Ghost tokens from the depths of the AMM underworld, all while contributing to the ever-decreasing supply through the dark magic of liquidity provider rewards.","links":"https://ghostcoin.network","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ghost-coin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"xrp":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"rw57VKMLgWYcgdcu89Bnz1YHne1gE35F1L"}}}
