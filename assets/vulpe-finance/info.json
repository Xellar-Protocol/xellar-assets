{"name":"Vulpe Finance","id":"vulpe-finance","symbol":"vulpefi","description":"VulpeFi is an emerging DeFi ecosystem that merges artificial intelligence (AI) with decentralized finance concepts—often referred to as “DefAI.” Its primary goal is to create a comprehensive, user-friendly environment where traders, enthusiasts, and explorers can access advanced DeFi services without facing the usual technical and security hurdles. A central component of VulpeFi is its Dex Aggregator—a system that scans multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXes) to find the best possible conditions (such as pricing, depth, and slippage) for token swaps. Instead of forcing users to hop between Uniswap, PancakeSwap, SushiSwap, and other DEXes manually, VulpeFi consolidates these options into a single interface, saving valuable time and lowering potential costs. Modes: Classic vs. Nexus Classic Mode: Users pay gas fees in the native token of whichever chain they’re operating on (e.g., ETH for Ethereum). This mode is straightforward, geared toward those who prefer immediate transactions and a simpler flow. Nexus Mode: VulpeFi’s more advanced method, Nexus Mode routes orders across multiple DEXes simultaneously, occasionally finding prices above standard market rates. It also embeds native front-running protection, offering enhanced security against automated bots that might exploit pending transactions.","links":"https://vulpefi.com","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/vulpe-finance/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xde914ed9f96853ab95df19481bd14f0fd9dc2249","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xde914ed9f96853ab95df19481bd14f0fd9dc2249"}}}
