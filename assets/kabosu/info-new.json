{"name":"Kabosu","id":"kabosu","symbol":"kabosu","description":"Kabosu (Japanese: かぼす) is a female Shiba Inu most famously known as the face of Doge. Kabosu was born in November 2nd, 2005 in a Japanese pedigree puppy mill that was promptly shut down, leaving Kabosu stranded in one of Japan’s many animal shelters. The owner of Kabosu, Atsuko Sato, rescued her in 2008, saving her from certain death at the hands of humanity. Her name was given by a shelter volunteer – Kabosu is a type of fruit and said rescue worker mentioned that her face was very round, just like the fruit. The goal of Kabosu is to prevent dogs of all breeds from being abandoned. For this reason we will be making weekly donations to community chosen dog charities!","links":"https://kabosutoken.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kabosu/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x4a824ee819955a7d769e03fe36f9e0c3bd3aa60b"}}}
