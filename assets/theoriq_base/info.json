{"name":"Theoriq","id":"theoriq_base","symbol":"thq","description":"Theoriq is a decentralized Web3 project that focuses on creating an ecosystem of autonomous AI agents that can collaborate in multi-agent swarms to perform complex tasks. Unlike traditional AI, these agents work together, validate each other’s outputs, and operate on-chain, making them especially useful for applications in DeFi, on-chain analytics, and automation. The project combines AI intelligence with blockchain technology, enabling developers, users, and data providers to contribute, earn rewards, and participate in decentralized governance. Its goal is to democratize AI by creating a community-driven, secure, and scalable network where autonomous agents can execute tasks and generate value efficiently.","links":"https://www.theoriq.ai/","market_cap":5622268,"market_cap_rank":1976,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/theoriq_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0b2558bdbc7ffec0f327fb3579c23dabd1699706","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x0b2558bdbc7ffec0f327fb3579c23dabd1699706"}},"is_native":false}
