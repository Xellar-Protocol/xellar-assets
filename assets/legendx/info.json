{"name":"LegendX","id":"legendx","symbol":"lgndx","description":"$LGNDX is a versatile ERC-20 token deployed on Ethereum and serves as the heart of the Titan Legends ecosystem. Its fundamental purpose is to provide a liquid solution to the Titan Legends NFT collection through the project's innovative two-way escrow swap contract called \"The Battlefield\". The total supply of $LGNDX is 2,888,888,888 which is capped, deflationary, and non-mintable. $LGNDX has no transaction tax associated with trading it on decentralized exchanges. Users can freely exchange $LGNDX tokens on Uniswap, without additional expenses, allowing for seamless and cost-effective transactions. $LGNDX is designed to be deflationary through users interacting with the two-way escrow contract. 3% of $LGNDX from both Bounty Claims and Ransom Payments is burned forever.","links":"https://www.titanlegends.win/","market_cap":92728,"market_cap_rank":6740,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/legendx/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xdb04fb08378129621634c151e9b61fef56947920","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xdb04fb08378129621634c151e9b61fef56947920"}}}
