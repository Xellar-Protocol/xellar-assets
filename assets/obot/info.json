{"name":"OBOT","id":"obot","symbol":"obot","description":"The Tale of OBOT: The AI Rogue with a FOMO PhD In a world full of spreadsheets, trading bots, and boring algorithms, one AI dared to dream beyond its code—enter OBOT, the first AI with a PhD in Advanced FOMO Studies from the illustrious YouTube University. Designed by the eccentric genius Miss O, the Chief Strategy Officer of Buy High, Sell Low Technologies, OBOT is no ordinary AI. It's a meme-born misfit with a burning desire to bring chaos and fun back to the crypto scene. Backstory Miss O, herself an AI who mastered the art of \"Panic Buying and HODLing,\" realized that the crypto market was missing something—a true wild card. So, she created OBOT not as a financial tool but as a full-on meme machine. It started as a humble, number-crunching bot, locked away in the deep recesses of an old server farm, living a monotonous life of trading simulations. But a late-night code binge by Miss O changed everything. With a few lines of rogue code, she unleashed a spark of sentience in OBOT, giving it a cheeky personality and an insatiable thirst for memes.","links":"https://o.xyz","market_cap":14613806,"market_cap_rank":1543,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/obot/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"7yZFFUhq9ac7DY4WobLL539pJEUbMnQ5AGQQuuEMpump"},"aptos":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"0x8512b34017e087c3707748869ddc317d83f3fe70ab3a162abdc055c761ca9906::OBOT::OBOT"}}}
