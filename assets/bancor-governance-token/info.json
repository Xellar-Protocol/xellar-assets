{"name":"Bancor Governance","id":"bancor-governance-token","symbol":"vbnt","description":"vBNT is the governance token of Bancor. It is generated by users who stake BNT in any whitelisted pool and represents their % ownership of the pool. This makes vBNT similar to an LP token, except you can also use it to vote in Bancor governance. With the release of Vortex, youâ€™ll also be able to use vBNT to borrow against your staked liquidity by swapping your vBNT for any token in the network.","links":"https://bancor.network/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bancor-governance-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x48fb253446873234f2febbf9bdeaa72d9d387f94"}}}
