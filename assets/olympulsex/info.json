{"name":"OlympulseX","id":"olympulsex","symbol":"sex","description":"What is the project about? The decentralized reserve currency designed to serve the ever growing Web3 financial ecosystem on PulseChain. What makes your project unique? OlympulseX is an algorithmic currency protocol with the goal of becoming a stable crypto-native currency. Though sometimes called an algorithmic stablecoin, OlympulseX is more akin to a central bank since it uses reserve assets like DAI to manage its price. The goal is to achieve price stability while maintaining a floating market-driven price. The biggest difference between SEX and stablecoins like USDC is that SEX is backed but not pegged to a certain price. Technically, the price floor for SEX is 1 DAI, but practically a premium and the treasury value is added to the price. SEX differs from other algorithmic stablecoins because it issues SEX to buy DAI and other assets and maintain a treasury. This mechanism allows the SEX token to float. History of your project.
