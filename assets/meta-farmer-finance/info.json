{"name":"Meta Farmer Finance","id":"meta-farmer-finance","symbol":"mff","description":"MFF is the first Gaming as a service token and the sister protocol to Food Farmer Finance. A collective of established DeFi 3.0 innovators, advisors, developers, yield farmers, and investors have come together to provide the community with exposure to the best GameFi and metaverse assets and farms available. Our mandate is to invest purely in the thriving Gaming / P2E / Metaverse sectors and diversify our treasury across a range of high-growth protocols that offer superior absolute returns to other asset classes. While GameFi can be highly lucrative it requires know-how and constant monitoring to succeed. We propose allowing users to participate in a smart contract GameFi hedge fund to produce yields on your behalf. Whаt mаkеѕ MFF different iѕ thе vast еxреriеnсе оf our fоundеrѕ аnd аdviѕоrѕ that boasting a рrоvеn trасk rесоrd in yield farming, investing, lаunсhing and funding crypto ѕtаrtuрѕ.

We see MFF as an asset allocation tool that exposes token holders to GameFi and Metaverse farms and yields that are otherwise complicated, time-consuming, and high-risk in nature. Within our framework, we manage funds that have been raised via our pre-sale and treasury to provide our holders with profits tied to the performance of our strategy and passive income generation. We believe this project has a significant advantage as the first mover of Gaming as a service and is a great tool to share the exponential growth within the sector to all holders of MFF.","links":"https://metafarmer.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/meta-farmer-finance/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xcbfa5f7e44d7cd08666766c2935e2fdaa953178f"}}}
