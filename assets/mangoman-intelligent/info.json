Mango Man is built on binance smart chain with extremely fast 5 second block times and cheaper gas fee than ethereum. Mango Man is decentralized and owned by a fun and a vibrant community. Our social responsibility includes The Elimination of forgery and crime from the internet world to make it a beautiful, breathable space. Mango Man employs 3 simple functions: Reflection + LP acquisition + Burn. In each trade, the transaction is charged a 10% fee, which is split 2 ways. 5% fee = redistributed to all existing holders. 5% fee is split 50/50 half of which is sold by the contract into BNB, while the other half of the MANGO MAN tokens are paired automatically with the previously mentioned BNB and added as a liquidity pair on Pancake Swap. 30%+ of the total supply has been burned so far so 30%+ of the 5% redistributions are burned with every transaction.","links":"https://mmint.io/","market_cap":5115427,"market_cap_rank":1566,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mangoman-intelligent/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x9767c8e438aa18f550208e6d1fdf5f43541cc2c8"}}}
