{"name":"Telos","id":"telos_ethereum","symbol":"tlos","description":"Fast. Private. Real-World Ready. Overview Telos is a next-generation Layer-1 blockchain built for real-world adoption - uniting high speed, scalability, and a privacy-first design in one powerful network. Its advanced WASM-based architecture powers the Telos EVM, an Ethereum-compatible environment delivering sub-second finality, zero front-running, and a frictionless developer experience. The Privacy Layer extends the EVM with integrated zero-knowledge technology - enabling shielded transactions, confidential dApps, and cross-token privacy directly within the ecosystem. For the first time, privacy will be a built-in feature of the EVM itself, not an add-on.","links":"https://telos.net","market_cap":9511479,"market_cap_rank":1596,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/telos_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x193f4a4a6ea24102f49b931deeeb931f6e32405d","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x193f4a4a6ea24102f49b931deeeb931f6e32405d"}},"is_native":false}
