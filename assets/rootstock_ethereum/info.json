It is the native token of Rootstock, Bitcoin’s DeFi Layer. Each rBTC is pegged 1:1 to BTC through the PowPeg, a decentralized, non-custodial two-way bridge secured by Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work through merge mining. Unlike wrapped Bitcoin tokens relying on centralized custodians, rBTC enables DeFi interactions in a trust-minimized way. For both individuals and institutions, rBTC is the most secure way to access DeFi on Bitcoin, providing a transparent, auditable proof-of-reserves while leveraging Bitcoin’s security.
