A dynamic prize vault, governed by a smart contract, awaits the moment it reaches a specific value to be unlocked and claimed by its steadfast holders. As the project concludes, the prize vault must amass 100,000 USDT, coinciding with the remaining circulation of only 100,000,000 $DOD100. At this juncture, holders can seamlessly exchange their $DOD100 for $USDT at the fixed rate of 1 $DOD100 = 0.001 $USDT. Notably, DODmini's listing price commences at $0.00001 during launch, promising an impressive 100x return for those who acquire it at the initial listing rate.","links":"https://dodmini.xyz","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/day-of-defeat-mini-100x/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xbebdcc8a61bf7372461cd1e746a0c2ead1bc06d2"}}}
