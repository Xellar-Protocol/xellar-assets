{"name":"SwiftCash","id":"swiftcash","symbol":"swift","description":"SwiftCash is an open-source, self-funded system of decentralized governance and economy, born out of a desire to create a digital store of value and a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency for daily transactional use along with cheat-proof lotteries that can be played by anyone in the blockchain without any custodian or third-party service getting involved, as well as on-chain HODL/Term deposits. SwiftCash uses the Proof-of-Stake algorithm to reach consensus and allows up to 10% of maximum inflation to be spent on proposals that are embraced by enough stakeholders. Another 10% of maximum inflation goes directly to stakeholders who help secure the network aka Miners and Masternodes, and the rest of maximum inflation which is 80% can go to HODL/Term deposits; coins that are time locked in the blockchain between 1-12 months.","links":"https://swiftcash.cc","market_cap":162956,"market_cap_rank":5683,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/swiftcash/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x99945f484ebc48f5307cc00cf8dcf8d6d3d4b017"}}}
