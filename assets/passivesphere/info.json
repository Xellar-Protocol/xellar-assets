Firstly, PassiveSphere wants to create a decentralized management system that allows companies to self-sustain, self-governed, and self-fund themselves via Security Token Offerings (STOs). Second, PassiveSphere aims to provide Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) with the infrastructure necessary to operate. The goal is for any business to be able to tokenize its assets and run in a native Web3 environment. PassiveSphere will be providing the infrastructure to allow new economic dynamics to exist: Business to DAO (B2D), DAO to Business (D2B), and DAO to DAO (D2D).","links":"http://www.passive-sphere.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/passivesphere/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x2aa963413e474863a40a074b32d8a902cdfc912c"}}}
