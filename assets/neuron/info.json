{"name":"Neuron","id":"neuron","symbol":"nrn","description":"Neuron ($NRN) is an ecosystem token that powers innovation in AI gaming and online competitive experiences. At the center of this ecosystem is ARC, an industry leading AI gaming SDK and the most scalable User Generated Agent (UGA) platform on the market. Powered by a proprietary machine learning (ML) model and infrastructure, ARC enables developers and players to easily create, train, and deploy AI agents in games by just playing the game. The flagship showcase, AI Arena, built on ARC, gives players the opportunity to train AI characters and enter them into a PvP fighting game. In this environment, the AI learns from its human master using a process known as Imitation Learning, allowing it to adopt unique strategies and characteristics. Players then submit their AIs into an arena to compete against AIs trained by other human players. $NRN will start by powering the in-game economy within AI Arena and grow in its utility as ARC onboards the next generation of AI powered games.","links":"https://www.aiarena.io/","market_cap":5312110,"market_cap_rank":1848,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/neuron/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xdadeca1167fe47499e53eb50f261103630974905"}}}
