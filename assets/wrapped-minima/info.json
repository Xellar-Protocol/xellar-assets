{"name":"Wrapped Minima","id":"wrapped-minima","symbol":"wminima","description":"Minima was founded in London in 2018. It has created an ultra-lean blockchain protocol that runs in full on a mobile or IoT device, allowing every user to run a constructing and validating node. By adopting this approach, Minima has enabled a completely decentralized network to be built, one that is scalable and inclusive, while remaining secure and resilient. Minima’s Public Presale will be for Wrapped Minima ($WMINIMA). 100% of Native Minima (1,000,000,000 $MINIMA coins) will be minted at the Token Generation Event, and 12.5% of these coins will be wrapped on the Ethereum blockchain as ERC-20 tokens (125,000,000 $WMINIMA coins), in order for Wrapped Minima to be tradable on exchanges shortly after the event.","links":"https://www.minima.global/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wrapped-minima/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x669c01caf0edcad7c2b8dc771474ad937a7ca4af","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x669c01caf0edcad7c2b8dc771474ad937a7ca4af"}}}
