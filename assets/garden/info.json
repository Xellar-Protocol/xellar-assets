{"name":"Garden","id":"garden","symbol":"grdn","description":"The seed of our project was planted in a small Discord server, where a group of Azuki enthusiasts envisioned a token that not only promotes growth and prosperity within its community, but also directly benefits its members. The result of this vision is $GRDN, a community coin that serves as a stimulus for Azuki and Beanz holders. We believe in the power of giving back, which is why we have committed to reinvesting 95% of all profits back into Azuki and Beanz, benefiting our $GRDN holders. Small taxes levied post-token launch will be used to sweep Beanz and, volume permitting, Azukis, which will then be distributed back to our token holders. We are excited about our upcoming adventure and eagerly look forward to sharing more updates with you. We invite you to join us on this thrilling journey, where we're not just growing a currency, but a strong, vibrant, and supportive community. As we like to say, 'What Sprouts in the Garden, Blossoms with the Community.' Together, we will thrive in the digital frontier. Welcome to our Garden.","links":"https://www.gardencoin.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/garden/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xdc9a328a55a9241fe14abc03498d57124063665b"}}}
