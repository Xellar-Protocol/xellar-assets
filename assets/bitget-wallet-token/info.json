{"name":"Bitget Wallet Token","id":"bitget-wallet-token","symbol":"bwb","description":"Bitget Wallet has accumulated over 20 million users worldwide ever since its establishment in 2018, becoming one of the largest non-custodial wallets globally. In April 2024, Bitget Wallet's Swap trading order volume and transactions surpassed even that of MetaMask, reaching new historic highs and marking a pivotal milestone in the platform's growth. Today, Bitget Wallet stands as more than just a wallet - it has evolved into a robust decentralized ecosystem platform poised to embark on the next chapter in its evolutionary journey as Bitget On-Chain Layer. Complementing Bitget Wallet's evolution is BWB, Bitget Wallet's very own official ecosystem token and the native token of Bitget On-Chain Layer. BWB serves multiple purposes within the Bitget Wallet ecosystem, primarily: - Community governance; - Staking; - Payment of multi-chain gas fees upon the release of the AA wallet; - Access to Bitget Wallet's Launchpad and Bitget's platform events; - Access to Fair Launchpool and GetDrop airdrop events; and - Eligibility for Bitget On-Chain Layer ecosystem project airdrops.","links":"https://web3.bitget.com/en/","market_cap":45265468,"market_cap_rank":728,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bitget-wallet-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"the-open-network":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"EQBaWrUZwQMcCEHZHf-dAFVhAWInbA7KJciM1W1aQxg4YT8I"},"solana":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"6FVyLVhQsShWVUsCq2FJRr1MrECGShc3QxBwWtgiVFwK"},"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x619c4bbbd65f836b78b36cbe781513861d57f39d"}}}
