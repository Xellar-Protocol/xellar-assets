{"name":"The Upsider AI","id":"the-upsider-ai","symbol":"up","description":"The Upsider AI began as a fair launch experiment on the Virtuals Protocol on Base, introducing its native token $UP. It started with a simple challenge: anyone could interact with @TheUpsiderAI on Twitter, attempting to convince it to accept $DAG. If successful, the AI would autonomously send tokens back—one of the first truly AI-driven token distribution experiments. This novel concept quickly drew a vibrant community eager to test their persuasion skills. Now, The Upsider AI runs 24/7, managing weekly challenges like the Snake Game (with over 1k DAG in prizes), autonomously promoting Constellation Network, and pushing the boundaries of decentralized AI.","links":"https://theupsiderai.com/","market_cap":234453,"market_cap_rank":5484,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/the-upsider-ai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x9e271ec4d66f2b400ad92de8a10e5c9c1914259c","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x9e271ec4d66f2b400ad92de8a10e5c9c1914259c"}}}
