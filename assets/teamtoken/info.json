{"name":"TeamToken","id":"teamtoken","symbol":"tt","description":"TeamToken is a Web3 application launched in 2023 by a Canada-based team that merges the worlds of sports and digital ownership. Operating on the Ethereum blockchain, the platform employs smart contracts to enable sports fans to become digital stakeholders in their favorite teams. Unlike traditional sports memorabilia or fan merchandise, these digital ownership stakes offer fans a way to earn tangible rewards based on the real-world performance of their chosen teams. One of the key features of TeamToken is its user-friendly interface, which streamlines the process of acquiring and managing these digital stakes, called TeamNFTs. Fans can easily navigate through the platform to buy, sell, or trade their ownership stakes, making the experience accessible even for those new to blockchain technology. The platform also provides real-time performance metrics and reward tracking for each sports team, adding an extra layer of engagement for the users. By combining elements of sports, blockchain, and community engagement, TeamToken has created a unique ecosystem where fans can not only support but also benefit from the success of their favorite teams. The platform serves as a novel way for sports enthusiasts to deepen their connection with the teams they love, all while introducing them to the benefits and functionalities of blockchain technology.","links":"https://teamtoken.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/teamtoken/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xdf906f6fd89ce60c16baed3c96ceb08bca65ad82"}}}
