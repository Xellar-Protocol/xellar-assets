{"name":"ICB Network","id":"icb-network","symbol":"icbx","description":"The project addresses the challenge of blockchain scalability by creating Layer 2 (L2) networks that utilize the existing consensus of Layer 1 (L1) to process transactions more efficiently. This setup reduces the complexity typically associated with independent L2 consensus mechanisms, as L1 handles the primary validation. The network also enables cross-layer data and asset transfers, fostering an interconnected, scalable ecosystem. This design minimizes redundancy, cuts operational costs, and improves speed, making it ideal for high-traffic or resource-intensive blockchain applications. Additionally, it lays the groundwork for future integrations, such as Zero-Knowledge Proofs, to further enhance verification and security across networks.","links":"https://www.icb.network/","market_cap":6536445,"market_cap_rank":2201,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/icb-network/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
