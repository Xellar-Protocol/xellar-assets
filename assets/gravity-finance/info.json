Current products include a Polygon Launchpad and Yield Farms. Production is underway on an AMM/Swaps Exchange, Vaults and Automated Investment Strategies, Derivatives Trading and other defi products.

GFI holders will automatically be eligible to receive admin-fees from all of our defi products by simply holding GFI in their wallets, no need to stake tokens to earn fees. Admin fees will be paid-out as 50% ETH and 50% BTC through smart contracts. The ETH portion is available for GFI holders to claim at any time, whereas the BTC portion accrues in a smart contract forming the tokens intrinsic value, making GFI \"\"backed by Bitcoin\"\" through admin fees that GFI holders can redeem at any time through a GFI burn-function.","links":"https://gravityfinance.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gravity-finance/logo.png"}
