KSD is a crypto-asset-backed stablecoin, maintaining its price stability via managing various types of collaterals in vaults, and also charging stability fee. Collateral Vaults are constantly monitored with price oracles. Based on the monitoring result, long-term demand and supply of KSD is adjusted thereby conserving its pegging with USD.
