{"name":"Treehouse","id":"treehouse_ethereum","symbol":"tree","description":"In traditional finance, fixed income markets far exceed equities and commodities in size — but in crypto, fixed income remains virtually non-existent due to the lack of infrastructure. The core missing piece is a decentralized benchmark rate to enable consistent product development and settlement. Treehouse introduces two foundational primitives to solve this: DOR (Decentralized Offered Rates): DOR is a decentralized benchmark rate-setting mechanism, inspired by LIBOR, designed to bring term structures to on-chain rates like staking yields. By using a network of panelists to submit forward rate expectations and staking them against accuracy, DOR enables products like interest rate swaps, fixed-rate loans, and forward rate agreements — unlocking a full-stack fixed income market in DeFi. tAssets (LST 2.0): tAssets are liquid staking token wrappers that arbitrage rate discrepancies across lending markets. For example, tETH aligns borrow rates with ETH staking yields while offering users a pick-up on top of the LST yield. This stabilizes DeFi rates and serves as a building block for yield-bearing strategies and structured products. Together, DOR and tAssets lay the groundwork for a scalable, decentralized fixed income ecosystem — solving the volatility and fragmentation of today's block-by-block floating rate protocols.","links":"https://www.treehouse.finance/","market_cap":16511337,"market_cap_rank":1223,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/treehouse/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x77146784315ba81904d654466968e3a7c196d1f3","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x77146784315ba81904d654466968e3a7c196d1f3"}},"is_native":false}
