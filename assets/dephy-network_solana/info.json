{"name":"DePHY Network","id":"dephy-network_solana","symbol":"phy","description":"The emergence of Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) represents a paradigm shift in how we approach infrastructure development and management. Traditional infrastructure systems are typically centralized, capital-intensive, and controlled by a small number of entities. DePIN introduces a new model where infrastructure deployment, maintenance, and operation are decentralized across numerous participants, incentivized through tokenization and blockchain technology. DePHY has gained significant traction across various sectors, including telecommunications, energy distribution, data storage, and sensor networks. Our core innovation is the ability to coordinate and incentivize distributed infrastructure deployment without central coordination, leveraging blockchain technology's inherent properties of transparency, immutability, and programmable incentives.","links":"https://dephy.io/","market_cap":205022,"market_cap_rank":5878,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dephy-network_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"DEpHYkW6nEm3Sxhb2rwftatrSAV3AP3ac6MgAWBbnsS8","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/DEpHYkW6nEm3Sxhb2rwftatrSAV3AP3ac6MgAWBbnsS8"}},"is_native":false}
