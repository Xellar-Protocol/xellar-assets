{"name":"ORDER","id":"order-2_avalanche","symbol":"order","description":"Pyramid Liquidity is a decentralized liquidity routing and yield optimization infrastructure designed to enhance capital efficiency across DeFi ecosystems. It operates through a modular smart contract system that enables automated liquidity deployment, cross-platform lending, leveraged trading strategies, and continuous fee generation. By integrating lending and borrowing of already-listed tokens, Pyramid Liquidity allows capital to remain productive while minimizing idle assets. Its native utility token, ORDER, plays a central role in the ecosystem by powering governance mechanisms, incentivizing liquidity providers, distributing protocol rewards, and facilitating automated fee swapping. The protocol is fully decentralized, with a focus on transparency, on-chain activity, and sustainable, long-term liquidity incentives.","links":"https://pyramidliquidity.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/order-2_avalanche/logo.png","detail_platform":{"avalanche":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x1bed077195307229fccbc719c5f2ce6416a58180","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/avax/tokens/0x1bed077195307229fccbc719c5f2ce6416a58180"}},"is_native":false}
