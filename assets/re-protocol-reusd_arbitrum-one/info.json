{"name":"Re Protocol reUSD","id":"re-protocol-reusd_arbitrum-one","symbol":"reusd","description":"Re Protocol (RE) is a blockchain-based platform that democratizes access to reinsurance risk by tokenizing exposure to insurance contracts. The protocol’s two deposit tokens—reUSD and reUSDe—let users choose between a principal-protected, fixed-yield product (reUSD, RF + 250 bps) or a risk-bearing, variable-yield option (reUSDe, up to ~23 % APR). Built on Ethereum, Avalanch, Arbitrum and Base, Re Protocol leverages decentralized underwriting pools to generate transparent, market-driven insurance returns. Governance and treasury functions are overseen by the Cayman-based Re Foundation to ensure regulatory compliance and capital efficiency. With integrations into DeFi ecosystems like Curve, Pendle, and Ethena, Re Protocol bridges traditional reinsurance markets and DeFi—opening institutional-grade risk diversification to crypto investors.","links":"https://re.xyz","market_cap":70085314,"market_cap_rank":531,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/re-protocol-reusd/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x76ce01f0ef25aa66cc5f1e546a005e4a63b25609","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/arbitrum/tokens/0x76ce01f0ef25aa66cc5f1e546a005e4a63b25609"}},"is_native":false}
