{"name":"SCORCHER","id":"scorcher","symbol":"scor","description":"Burn tokens can play a pivotal role in helping projects increase in scarcity, therefore potentially increase in value/price. After experiencing how successful our tokenomics were with $PYRO, we decided to compliment our successful launch with an ecosystem of unique proprietary tokenomics based projects. These tokens within the ecosystem could stand alone as powerhouses, but they will also compliment $PYRO along the way. We plan to do this by using a 3% tax that goes towards buying and burning our partner token $PYRO, as well as 3% tax that goes towards auto liquidity which will stabilize price, and 3% towards a true burn of SCORCHER.","links":"https://www.scorcherburn.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/scorcher/logo.png"}
