{"name":"Megatech","id":"megatech","symbol":"mgt","description":"To answer the critical demand for electricity in South Africa, MGT Solar (PTY) Ltd, an Alternate Energy Supply Company, is building eight 10mwa Solar Energy Plants within the next 60 months in South Africa. We are fueling this timely construction with the MGT Token developed in 2020 on the Apollo Blockchain platform. Until now storage of energy was not truly cost-effective due to the high cost of storage cells and the relatively short lifespan thereof. An additional obstacle until now was the time consuming process to get prospective energy projects finalized, registered, compliant and funded. By utilizing our strategic partnerships and an ICO funding model we will shorten this period from 60 months to 18 months until our first Solar plants are commissioned. By unleashing the synergies between our extremely qualified, experienced and competent team members in the crypto and power supply industry we believe can create the most valuable ICO project ever.","links":"https://mgtsolar.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/megatech/logo.png"}
