{"name":"Vanilla","id":"vanilla-2","symbol":"bum","description":"The NFT market is a market with outstanding growth potential among the crypto markets. Compared to the beginning of last year, the market capitalization and trading volume of the market have grown by several orders of magnitude, and numerous companies with IP as well as existing crypto investors are issuing NFTs in the crypto scene or starting to prepare for it. However, compared to the heat of this hot market, the fundamental limitations of NFT as an asset have not yet been properly overcome. It is the low liquidity that the non-fungible property inevitably implies. An asset with low liquidity has to bear a very high slippage in order to liquidate quickly, which is an incentive to undervalue the asset relative to its average transaction price. Low liquidity is an even more critical problem in highly volatile asset classes where there is a great incentive to stop-losses. Compared to a 50-60% decrease in cryptocurrency market trading volume over the past year, NFT market trading volume has decreased by more than 90%. NFTs are mostly ERC-721 based tokens, so they are virtually the only tokens in the world, so unlike existing ERC-20 tokens, they cannot be distinguished and have a structure with low liquidity. Vanilla is a platform service that provides profit realization opportunities through deposit, lock-up and boosting using the platform token Vanilla, and NFT collateral loan service through NFT reinforcement by providing new liquidity and adding entertainment interest to the NFT market.","links":"https://main.bumup.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/vanilla-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
