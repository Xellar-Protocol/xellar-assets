{"name":"CREATOR","id":"creator","symbol":"creator","description":"Creator is building a set of AI Agents to help businesses grow organically across channels. Our platform enables users to generate high-quality content for blogs, social media posts, and short-form videos, all tailored to their brand voice and marketing goals. From idea to execution, our AI Agents assist with topic discovery, writing, design, and even publishing through native integrations with platforms like WordPress, Shopify, and more. We’re making it simple for small businesses, creators, and founders to run content-led marketing without needing to hire a full team. Think of Creator as your personal digital content team, powered by AI. The $CREATOR token powers the ecosystem. Users can use tokens to pay for subscriptions, buy extra content credits, and unlock premium features. They’re also rewarded with tokens when they refer other businesses to join the platform. In the near future, we’ll introduce a staking pool. Users who stake their $CREATOR tokens will receive platform benefits such as additional credits, subscription rewards, and exclusive access to new features and agents. Creator aims to become the go-to content engine for SMBs, bridging the gap between marketing expertise and execution—making organic growth more accessible, scalable, and rewarding.","links":"https://creator.li","market_cap":91530,"market_cap_rank":6758,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/creator/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"CRGqUDQ4JQKx5pTqWHRpwiA95fmpuQe2ir92eBi6hgmW","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/CRGqUDQ4JQKx5pTqWHRpwiA95fmpuQe2ir92eBi6hgmW"}}}
