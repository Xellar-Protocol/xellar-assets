{"name":"Spawn Tools","id":"spawn-tools","symbol":"spawn","description":"Spawn is building the visual entertainment layer for the next evolution of AI Agents: Fully interactive 3D companions that can move, speak, remember, and interact. Powered by our GenAI platform, the current live version of Spawn lets anyone generate 3D characters and items from a text prompt or 2D image. Users can also use our 3D generation platform for game asset generation and 3D printing. Social functions (user profiles, achievements, and engagement) are currently fully functional and create a deeper sense of involvement in the Spawn ecosystem. In the near future, users will be able to generate their custom character in 3D, then seamlessly “attach” Spawn’s bespoke agentic framework to bring it to life as an interactive companion. In addition, we’ll be launching an in-house text-to-game AI model and dataset to allow further usability and to democratize game development. This technology utilizes a variety of game engines, including Phaser, Excalibur, and ThreeJS.","links":"https://www.spawntools.ai","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/spawn-tools/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
