The crazy one About Hoodrat Hoodrat, the bat/rat-like creature in Matt Furieâ€™s The Night Riders, is one of four mysterious characters in this wordless, dreamlike tale. While the book itself provides no names, Hoodratâ€™s identity is revealed in the endnotes, which include a dedication to Furieâ€™s pet rats, Wat and Fox, and other cryptically named figures. Given the connection to Furieâ€™s love for rats and the unlikelihood of the frog being called Hoodrat, itâ€™s clear the bat-like creature embodies this fitting name, adding a personal touch to the surreal narrative.
