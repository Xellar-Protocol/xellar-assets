{"name":"InnovaMinex","id":"innovaminex","symbol":"minx","description":"InnovaMinex is an innovative business model that uses blockchain technology to guarantee the traceability of precious metals. By applying a set of procedures, it is possible to certify the whole process, from its origin in the mines, to the refinery and the commercialization to the end consumer. This commercialization is done through our e-commerce, partner stores and our own ATMs. InnovaMinex will give buyers the opportunity to verify the origin of the metal that they acquire. Buyers will be able to obtain assurances that the extraction of metal is legal, that the environment has been protected, and that transactions can not be used for money laundering. All are registered and the whole community has access to them. Our ultimate goal is to get the best possible price for our clients and for our community, with emphasis being placed on the transparency and safety of all transactions conducted.","links":"https://innovaminex.com/en/inx ","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/innovaminex/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0xae353daeed8dcc7a9a12027f7e070c0a50b7b6a4"}}}
