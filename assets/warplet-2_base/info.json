{"name":"Warplet","id":"warplet-2_base","symbol":"warp","description":"$WARP is the unofficial mascot for Farcaster. WARP is a symbol of being crazy enough to never stop trekking through the idea maze. The WARP mascot has the energy of a silly, goofy hacker who is willing to trying something new. Warplets embody this quote. What the warplets are hacking with today will define how the next generation will approach communities, marketing, ecosystems, network states, and so on. Warplets are proud to be called stupid. Warplets are thriving most when outsiders don't understand what they're doing. Warplets are the crazies willing to put time into weird ideas. The only things Warplets need are coffee, internet connection, and a safe space to dream with other Warplets.","links":"https://clanker.world/clanker/0xd9159Ad2d5fe625CD1F54f4D328fB19CB5262B07","market_cap":438608,"market_cap_rank":4772,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/warplet-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd9159ad2d5fe625cd1f54f4d328fb19cb5262b07","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xd9159ad2d5fe625cd1f54f4d328fb19cb5262b07"}},"is_native":false}
