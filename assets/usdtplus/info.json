{"name":"Overnight.fi USDT+","id":"usdtplus","symbol":"usdt+","description":"Overnight Finance is an asset management protocol offering passive yield products based on delta-neutral strategies, primarily for conservative stablecoin investors. The pegging mechanism is based on the ‘NAV of 1’ policy (“Net Asset Value”), i.e. market value of assets equals the amount of USDT+ in circulation. This is achieved by: – Conservative risk management aims to avoid daily losses by building a diversified portfolio of highly conservative DeFi Investments – Daily distribution of profits in the form of a rebase to USDT+ holders; all yield collected by the USDT+ reserves are distributed to USDT+ holders directly by increasing their wallet balance once a day Use a liquidity index reflecting the current ratio of the number of issued USDT+ tokens to the volume of assets on strategies (Strategy), expressed in USDT.","links":"https://overnight.fi/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/usdtplus/logo.png","detail_platform":{"linea":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0x1e1f509963a6d33e169d9497b11c7dbfe73b7f13"},"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0xb1084db8d3c05cebd5fa9335df95ee4b8a0edc30"},"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x5335e87930b410b8c5bb4d43c3360aca15ec0c8c"}}}
