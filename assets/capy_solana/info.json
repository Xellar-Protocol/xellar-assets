{"name":"CAPY","id":"capy_solana","symbol":"capy","description":"$CAPY is a meme token inspired by the capybara — a super chill, social animal that’s popular online. This project isn’t about complicated tech or financial tricks; it’s all about community, fun, and internet culture. $CAPY uses humor and viral energy with a strong Spanish-speaking community backing it. The goal is to become a well-known meme icon and later release NFT collectibles to build a real sense of community.","links":"https://www.itsacapy.com/","market_cap":8772.16,"market_cap_rank":11426,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/capy_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"D3S1AW1Tj1BbQVCo34D9frJDoD81dU8YRCPhbtUUpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/D3S1AW1Tj1BbQVCo34D9frJDoD81dU8YRCPhbtUUpump"}},"is_native":false}
