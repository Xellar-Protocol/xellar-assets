{"name":"TWIN ASSET TOKEN AAPL","id":"twin-asset-token-aapl","symbol":"aapl","description":"TWIN Finance is a decentralized finance protocol for synthetic derivatives of real-world assets on blockchain. Its distinct long & short “twin-token” method enables the creation of synthetic assets that reflect the price of a real-world asset or crypto equivalent. This method offers high capital efficiency without requiring over-collateralization or exposure to the risk of liquidation. For liquidity providers, this twin-token approach substantially minimizes price risks, bringing them near to stable-coin levels.","links":"https://app.twinfinance.io","market_cap":17816.96,"market_cap_rank":10119,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/twin-asset-token-aapl/logo.png","detail_platform":{"berachain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x63ca3e797cbbcb16b1875d42b4869af7d328d820","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/berachain/tokens/0x63ca3e797cbbcb16b1875d42b4869af7d328d820"}}}
