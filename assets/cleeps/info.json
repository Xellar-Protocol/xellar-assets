{"name":"Cleeps","id":"cleeps","symbol":"clps","description":"Cleeps' smart contract ecosystem includes the fungible token, NFT, marketplace on the BSC network. Fungible token Cleeps will be released first to raise initial investments and trade in the Cleeps Marketplace in exchange for NFT. Every new Cleeps user will directly impact the token price growth that causes demand increase and trading volume using the ecosystem's smart contracts. The NFT is a user video collection that is decentralized and stored in IPFS. The collection integrity is ensured by in-platform token creation only. Before the token minting, the video should go through a poll on the platform to raise enough votes. Subsequently, the market is filled only with awesome content. And on the other hand, the user pays for the gas if the video is in demand only.","links":"http://cleeps.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cleeps/logo.png"}
