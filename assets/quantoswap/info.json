{"name":"QuantoSwap","id":"quantoswap","symbol":"qns","description":"QuantoSwap is a cutting-edge decentralized exchange (DEX) built on Ethereum with the ability to exchange Liquid Staking Tokens. Like other LS protocols, our project is launching its own native LST with the option to convert to ETH and other LSTs with enhanced annual percentage rate (APR) staking and farming capabilities. QNS token utilities include: Yield from swap fees, which are distributed among project token holders. 70% reward for liquidity providers, 30% for token holders. Further profit is expected from the commission earned by validating our proprietary LST. This is our own stETH, which allows users to stake ETH without owning 32 ETH to start their own node. Our protocol plans to deduct a small commission from the minting profits to distribute among token holders and token liquidity. Protocol yield from launching our proprietary Yield Tokenization protocol: protocol fees are distributed among token holders. Insurance for YT/PT tokens: the ability to cover YT tokens with insurance if the profit turns out to be less than what was initially anticipated at the time of purchase. LP reward boost for token holders. More tokens mean more reward boosts. DAO Voting. Protocol validation.","links":"https://quantoswap.org/","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/quantoswap/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x37a2f8701856a78de92dbe35df2200c355eae090"}}}
