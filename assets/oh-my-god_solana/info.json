{"name":"OH MY GOD","id":"oh-my-god_solana","symbol":"omg","description":"Oh My God is – a guy who accidentally wins everything possible. Buys a token as a joke – gets a Lamborghini. Opens a mystery box on a stream – finds a million dollars inside. Permanently in shock from his own luck, screaming “OH MY GOD” and having no idea what's going on. OhMyGod is more than just a meme coin; it's a symbol of imagination, joy, and the boundless potential of blockchain technology. The horned raccoon, or \"OhMyGod\", represents a fusion of two beloved creatures: the graceful raccoon and the mythical raccoon. This whimsical combination embodies the project's core values: Creativity: OhMyGod encourages creative expression through NFTs, fostering a community where artists and collectors can thrive. Optimism: The unicorn's association with dreams and positivity aligns with OhMyGod's vision for a brighter, decentralized future. Uniqueness: Just as each OhMyGod is one-of-a-kind, OhMyGod aims to stand out in the crowded DeFi landscape with innovative features and a dedicated community.","links":"https://omgtoken.com/","market_cap":145517,"market_cap_rank":6407,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/oh-my-god_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"Fa7mkzDfzkgU2iQrwzpAvrpQoLFnMM85qnZCdaK4agQR","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/Fa7mkzDfzkgU2iQrwzpAvrpQoLFnMM85qnZCdaK4agQR"}},"is_native":false}
