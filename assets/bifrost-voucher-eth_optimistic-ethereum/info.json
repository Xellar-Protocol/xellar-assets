{"name":"Bifrost Voucher ETH","id":"bifrost-voucher-eth_optimistic-ethereum","symbol":"veth","description":"Bifrost is a staking yield layer that establishes a standardized multi-chain liquid staking rewards infrastructure, delivering composable crypto-native yields for stablecoins, RWAs, and DeFi across various blockchains. Its modular design allows developers to tap into multi-chain staking rewards with one integration, greatly lowering development costs and enhancing user simplicity. The easiest way to understand Bifrost is to see it as a derivative issuer that provides liquidity for all pledged assets, issuing corresponding shadow assets during the bonding period of the original assets. At the same time, the shadow asset is a fungible Token that can be circulated in different DEXs, pools, protocols and across chains.","links":"https://app.bifrost.io/vstaking/vETH","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bifrost-voucher-eth/logo.png","detail_platform":{"optimistic-ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc3997ff81f2831929499c4ee4ee4e0f08f42d4d8","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/optimism/tokens/0xc3997ff81f2831929499c4ee4ee4e0f08f42d4d8"}},"is_native":false}
