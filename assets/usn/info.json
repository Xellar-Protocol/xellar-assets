{"name":"USN","id":"usn","symbol":"usn","description":"$USN is a NEAR-native stablecoin soft-pegged to the US Dollar, backed by a Reserve Fund that contains $NEAR, as well as $USDT initially. $USN’s core stability mechanisms consist of on-chain arbitrage and the Reserve Fund based on the Currency Board principle. Combining the growth potential of $UST and the strong peg defense of $FRAX, $USN is positioned to be one of the most effective ways to bootstrap liquidity in the NEAR ecosystem; all while adding a new layer to $NEAR’s utility as a token. $USN’s smart contracts and Reserve Fund are managed by the Decentral Bank DAO.","links":"https://near.org/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/usn/logo.png"}
