{"name":"Corgi Finance","id":"corgi-finance","symbol":"cog","description":"Corgi finance is a Yield Aggregator (Vault) that provides optimised yields for users. The protocol is developed by Corgi team and will be governed by $COG holders. Corgi Finance automatically maximizes the user rewards from various liquidity pools (LPs), automated market-making (AMM) projects, and other yield farming opportunities in the DeFi ecosystem. This provides a massive advantage over manual operation. From all of the vaults deployed, Corgi Finance has its native governance token $COG at its core. Platform revenue is generated from a small percentage of all the vault profits and distributed back to those who stake $COG. As a decentralized project with a deeply ingrained crypto-mindset, there is also a robust governance system in place to put the decision-making power in the hands of those invested in the project by governance mechanisms build around $COG.","links":"https://www.corgi.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/corgi-finance/logo.png","detail_platform":{"dogechain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa8fc6ef0b48557596d4a75ff85a288a982606707"}}}
