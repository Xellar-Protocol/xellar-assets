{"name":"Dough","id":"dough","symbol":"dough","description":"Dough is the first reward token to implement a deflationary, positive reward system combined with strong utility. The Dough Token Management System (DoughPad) is built to provide all the tools necessary for developers and investors to track, trade, and create crypto projects while generating revenue for the Dough ecosystem. The external revenues are used to exert buying pressure on the Dough chart and provide holders with passive income. While these benefits are currently only available to users of BSC, Dough will be launching the platform across chains with other EVM chains as early targets, and further plans to integrate with Cardano, Solana, and Terra.","links":"https://doughpad.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dough/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xede5020492be8e265db6141cb0a1d2df9dbae9bb"}}}
