It pairs Hyperliquid’s HYPE token and gold-backed stablecoins such as Tether’s XAUT0 as core liquidity, positioning itself as a ‘GOLD × HYPE Memecoin’. The project migrated to WGC V3 in April 2025 with a LayerZero OFT and Superchain ERC-20 upgrade — enabling native token transfers across 32+ blockchains.","links":"https://www.wildgoatcoin.com/","market_cap":183661,"market_cap_rank":6049,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wild-goat-coin-2_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0x3d63825b0d8669307366e6c8202f656b9e91d368","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x3d63825b0d8669307366e6c8202f656b9e91d368"}},"is_native":false}
