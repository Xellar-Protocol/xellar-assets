{"name":"Wrapped NXM","id":"wrapped-nxm","symbol":"wnxm","description":"NXM token itself is created solely for internal use within the Nexus Mutual protocol and all of its holders must go through KYC. As such, a wrapped version is created to allow more users to own the token without having to do KYC. In the meantime it also improves its liquidity outside the protocolâ€™s bonding curve by being listed on exchanges such as Uniswap and Binance. To make use of the wNXM token, it first needs to be unwrapped into NXM by a registered member of Nexus Mutual. After it is unwrapped, wNXM becomes NXM and can be used as a normal token on the Nexus Mutual platform.","links":"https://nexusmutual.io/","market_cap":42313192,"market_cap_rank":647,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wrapped-nxm/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0d438f3b5175bebc262bf23753c1e53d03432bde"}}}
