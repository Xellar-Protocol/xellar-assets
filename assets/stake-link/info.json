{"name":"stake.link","id":"stake-link","symbol":"sdl","description":"The SDL token performs three key functions: SDL is a fee token — staking SDL will return a percentage of all fees generated by the platform. This fee scales directly with the amount of LINK and rewards in the protocol. SDL is a governance token — voting will help shape the platform, determine future fees, and participant involvement. SDL provides priority staking access — stakers of SDL will be the first to deposit LINK at stake.link.","links":"https://stake.link","market_cap":33740829,"market_cap_rank":1026,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/stake-link/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa95c5ebb86e0de73b4fb8c47a45b792cfea28c23","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xa95c5ebb86e0de73b4fb8c47a45b792cfea28c23"}}}
