{"name":"stake.link","id":"stake-link","symbol":"sdl","description":"The SDL token performs three key functions: SDL is a fee token — staking SDL will return a percentage of all fees generated by the platform. This fee scales directly with the amount of LINK and rewards in the protocol. SDL is a governance token — voting will help shape the platform, determine future fees, and participant involvement. SDL provides priority staking access — stakers of SDL will be the first to deposit LINK at stake.link.","links":"https://stake.link","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/stake-link/logo.png"}
