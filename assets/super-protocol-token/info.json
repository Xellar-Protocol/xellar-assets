Super Protocol creates a decentralized, open, vastly scalable marketplace to serve growing demand for easy-to-access, intelligently-aggregated data from multiple secure sources. This marketplace brings together data providers, TEE (trusted execution environment) infrastructure providers, solution providers (e.g. analytics tools) and data users in a fully decentralized, serverless and permissionless system, governed by a DAO model.
