{"name":"Moonwell","id":"moonwell-artemis","symbol":"well","description":"Moonwell Artemis uses battle tested code from the Moonwell Apollo protocol to provide an open, non-custodial lending and borrowing DeFi protocol. While Apollo is a community driven protocol with innovative features, Artemis users will enjoy polished features with faster transaction times, while still preserving the same level of security. Moonwellâ€™s goal is to be the most user-friendly, fast, and secure DeFi protocol in the ecosystem. With this in mind, an emphasis was placed on having a high standard of security. Multi-signature systems are implemented for all smart contracts used by the protocol, with the expert cyber-security team at Halborn Security auditing all contracts before deployment. Additionally, there is a generous bounty program through a partnership with the trusted team at ImmuneFi, which allows security researchers to submit their findings for review and earn a bounty for discovering security vulnerabilities.","links":"https://moonwell.fi","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/moonwell-artemis/logo.png","detail_platform":{"moonbeam":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x511ab53f793683763e5a8829738301368a2411e3"},"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xff8adec2221f9f4d8dfbafa6b9a297d17603493d"}}}
