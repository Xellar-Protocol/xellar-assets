{"name":"Metafluence","id":"metafluence","symbol":"meto","description":"\"Metafluence enables influencers to monetize their social media power and creativity in the Metaverse. As social media (SM) is transitioning to the metaverse, our vision is to build an influencer-centric ecosystem in the metaverse where SM influencers, their audiences, and brands are easily engaged in transparent and incentivized relations. We are on a mission to convert SM Influencers into metaverse entrepreneurs (Metapreneurs) through our influence-to-earn Metafluence platform. Our solutions for influencers automatically address the brand and audience challenges, enabling all the parties to thrive in Web 3.0. Metafluence is the name of a city in the metaverse which is ruled by SM influencers. Influencer homes (Metahuts) are the main architectural elements of the city and will serve as personalized spaces (similar to land plots) in the metaverse. The Metahuts will be consisted of rooms which are personalized spaces, and they will allow influencers to better monetize their SM influence, engage closely with their audience and brands in the Metafluence ecosystem. Influencers will be able to group in Influencer clans (Metaclans) to unify their SM influence and reach. Influencers, their audiences, and brands will be able to engage in a variety of events that could be in-clan, public, private or premium. The main focus of the events is to allow influencers to monetize their SM reach and influence, whether itâ€™s the audience participation or brand sponsorships.\"","links":"http://metafluence.com","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/metafluence/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa78775bba7a542f291e5ef7f13c6204e704a90ba"}}}
