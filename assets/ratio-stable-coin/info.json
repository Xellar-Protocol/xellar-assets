You can mint USDr using yield bearing stable assets without sacrificing the underlying yield, which in effect pays you to borrow (similar to Alchemix). The amount of USDr that you can mint is determined by the risk of the deposited asset.","links":"https://app.ratio.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ratio-stable-coin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"USDrbBQwQbQ2oWHUPfA8QBHcyVxKUq1xHyXsSLKdUq2"}}}
