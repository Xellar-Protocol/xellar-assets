{"name":"Renzo Restaked JTO","id":"renzo-restaked-jto","symbol":"ezjto","description":"Renzo is a restaking protocol that abstracts and manages AVS strategies for Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs), making Ethereum and Solana restaking ezpz and accessible to everyone. The products $ezETH, $pzETH, and $ezSOL serve as interfaces to the EigenLayer, Symbiotic, and Jito Network ecosystems, respectively. Renzo's mission is to make restaking easy and accessible to everyone. Renzo Protocol abstracts all complexity away from the end-user. Renzo users no longer have to worry about: Node operation: setting up and operating hardware to meet the standards set by AVSs Strategy management: choosing which AVSs to secure for optimal risk-reward returns Smart contract interfacing: interacting with on-chain smart contracts to restake properly Renzo strongly advocates for permissionless innovation on Ethereum and Solana, and programmatically acquiring trust for the ecosystem. Renzo is built to promote the widespread adoption of these technologies and the platforms that facilitate them, like EigenLayer and Symbiotic.","links":"https://www.renzoprotocol.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/renzo-restaked-jto/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"ezjtoE6PYVnWkbJJYEsGHgR3rXgBydi9eeB1YHP8cVg","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/ezjtoE6PYVnWkbJJYEsGHgR3rXgBydi9eeB1YHP8cVg"}}}
