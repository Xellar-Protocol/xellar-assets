{"name":"MMA Gaming","id":"mma-gaming","symbol":"mma","description":"\"MMA Gaming (“MMA”) is a large-scale gaming operation, or guild. Our core revenue stream comes from providing a global base of players with the knowledge, skills, and in-game assets necessary to effectively play and earn across different metaverse worlds or games. Our players receive a highly equitable share of earnings, as attested to by our positive player testimonials. With a solid and sustainable revenue base, we have also augmented our metaverse exposure - seed allocations to peers and games help diversify MMA’s exposure in the sector. Furthermore, our expert treasury team actively manages our capital so that it is never idle, while at the same time ensuring the treasury fund is not overexposed to macro risks. Finally, we have developed several workflow tools which can be scaled and commercialized for smaller guilds with fewer resources.\"","links":"https://mmagaming.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mma-gaming/logo.png"}
