{"name":"Fairy","id":"fairy","symbol":"fairy","description":"FairySwap is a next-generation, community-driven privacy DEX that is committed to being permissionless and decentralized. By leveraging the zero-knowledge proof technology built into Findora, privacy DEXs and Dapps like FairySwap give users the ability to choose what information they want to be visible on a public blockchain, and what they would rather shield. The information they want to be invisible can still be publicly verified with zero-knowledge proofs without revealing any details.","links":"https://www.fairyswap.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/fairy/logo.png","detail_platform":{"findora":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xccc94d78b01d94330f25f7b8e827ef24249132de"}}}
