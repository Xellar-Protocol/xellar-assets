{"name":"Polkadot","id":"polkadot","symbol":"dot","description":"Polkadot is a platform that allows diverse blockchains to transfer messages, including value, in a trust-free fashion; sharing their unique features while pooling their security. In brief, Polkadot is a scalable heterogeneous multi-chain technology. Polkadot is heterogeneous because it is entirely flexible and makes no assumption about the nature or structure of the chains in the network. Even non-blockchain systems or data structures can become parachains if they fulfill a set of criteria. Polkadot may be considered equivalent to a set of independent chains (e.g. a set containing Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Namecoin and Bitcoin) except with important additions: pooled security and trust-free interchain transactability. Many of the native parachains of Polkadot will be written using a Polkadot Runtime Environment SDK (e.g. Parity Technologies' Substrate).","links":"https://polkadot.com/","market_cap":6048215601,"market_cap_rank":34,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/polkadot/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":10,"contract_address":"0x196c20da81fbc324ecdf55501e95ce9f0bd84d14","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x196c20da81fbc324ecdf55501e95ce9f0bd84d14"},"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8d010bf9c26881788b4e6bf5fd1bdc358c8f90b8","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x8d010bf9c26881788b4e6bf5fd1bdc358c8f90b8"},"optimistic-ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8d010bf9c26881788b4e6bf5fd1bdc358c8f90b8","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/optimism/tokens/0x8d010bf9c26881788b4e6bf5fd1bdc358c8f90b8"},"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8d010bf9c26881788b4e6bf5fd1bdc358c8f90b8","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/arbitrum/tokens/0x8d010bf9c26881788b4e6bf5fd1bdc358c8f90b8"},"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8d010bf9c26881788b4e6bf5fd1bdc358c8f90b8","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x8d010bf9c26881788b4e6bf5fd1bdc358c8f90b8"}}}
