{"name":"Raresama","id":"raresama","symbol":"poop","description":"Raresama is an NFT Marketplace governed by the Moonsama Multiverse community and focused primarily on empowering artists. Artwork published on Raresama is incorporated into the Moonsama Multiverse in various forms such as equippables, thereby gaining utility. Raresama is fully governed and curated by the Moonsama Multiverse community, and all NFTs added to the platform have to be voted in by the community. Full governance by the community encourages decisions to be made for the benefit of development, and provides for an environment where artists can freely unleash their creativity. The voting process is facilitated through the marketplace's own governance token: $POOP. POOP token is transferrable and underpins the whole marketplace. A small fee in POOP must also be paid to create a Raresama user profile and mint NFTs.","links":"https://raresama.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/raresama/logo.png"}
