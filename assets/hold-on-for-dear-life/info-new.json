{"name":"Hold On for Dear Life","id":"hold-on-for-dear-life","symbol":"hodl","description":"Launched on October 30, 2023, $HODL is an ERC-20 memecoin inspired by the popular crypto term \"HODL\". This term was coined by a Bitcoin enthusiast named GameKyuubi, meaning \"Hold On for Dear Life\". There is a maximum supply of 1 billion (1,000,000,000) $HODL tokens, and no new tokens can be minted. There is no tax on $HODL buy transactions. However, there is a 6% tax on every sell transaction: a unique mechanism called the \"anti-jeet shield.\" Aiming to eliminate jeets from the crypto sphere, this 6% tax serves two purposes: 3% is redistributed to all $HODL holders, providing them with passive income. The other 3% is allocated to marketing, promoting what is arguably the most recognised crypto term-turned-memecoin. The liquidity of $HODL is locked for one year. Additionally, the contract has been audited, with zero flaws found, ensuring maximum security for investors. The vision for $HODL is simple: to create an era where the jeet mentality is obsolete and to transform everyone into true, diamond-handed HODLERS.","links":"https://hodl-token.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/hold-on-for-dear-life/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xe2f98dd7506807ef82d1988aa77c320bc52f8df4"}}}
