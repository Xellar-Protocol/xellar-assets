{"name":"Sport and Leisure","id":"sport-and-leisure","symbol":"snl","description":"The main problem of today’s crypto industry is the absence of a solid connection with the real economy. Crypto markets are very easy to enter, but exiting market is associated with costs, risks and difficulties. These days many teams are trying to develop stable cryptocurrencies to facilitate global adoption and avoid risks that are mentioned above. Tether called as USDT is the best-known solution to this problem. Rapid growth and over $2bn market capitalization show massive demand for such stable coins. However, Tether and other similar asset-backed coins have many flaws that SnL TOKEN does not have as we have fixed the change rate backed by Ethereum with 18181 for each ETH as the minimum value of our token. It’s time to create a truly reliable and stable cryptocurrency that will become a solid bridge between the traditional and digital sport and leisure industries. That’s the reason we created SnL TOKEN.","links":"https://www.snltoken.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/sport-and-leisure/logo.png"}
