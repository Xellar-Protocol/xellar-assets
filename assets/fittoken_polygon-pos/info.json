{"name":"FITtoken","id":"fittoken_polygon-pos","symbol":"fit","description":"FITtoken is a utility token that links verifiable physical activity to programmable digital value. The FITtoken Move dApp connects to Apple Health, Google Health Connect and other wearable APIs, records metrics such as steps, distance, floors climbed and calories burned, and submits them to an on-chain oracle. When the data pass anti-cheat and geolocation checks, a smart contract mints FIT tokens proportional to the effort logged. Holders can stake their tokens to unlock higher emission rates, redeem them for partner rewards (e.g., gym memberships, gear and healthy-meal vouchers) or trade them on supporting DEX/CEX markets. The total supply is fixed and vesting schedules govern ecosystem, team and community allocations, creating a transparent inflation curve. By turning everyday movement into an auditable digital asset, FITtoken aims to improve public health, foster long-term user engagement and open a new incentive layer for fitness brands, corporate wellness programs and Web3 communities.","links":"https://www.fittoken.io/","market_cap":852754,"market_cap_rank":3935,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/fittoken_polygon-pos/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x11b37c9388420d79d48e8d531227f43c9bf1bbf1","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/polygon_pos/tokens/0x11b37c9388420d79d48e8d531227f43c9bf1bbf1"}},"is_native":false}
