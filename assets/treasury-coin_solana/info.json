{"name":"Treasury Coin","id":"treasury-coin_solana","symbol":"treasury","description":"The Treasury Coin is built so the floor price always climbs, no matter what direction the price action moves. Here’s how it works: Every transaction comes with a 1% creator reward. Instead of cashing out, we will put 100% of it In a Treasury Vault, to be permanently locked. As volume increases, more and more supply gets pulled out of circulation and into a vault forever. The Math: $10,000,000 in trading volume → 1% = $100,000 in creator rewards $100,000 worth of Treasury Coin will be bought on the open market and locked permanently and publicly in a vault. As the treasury grows, the floor price increases. Every buy makes the base stronger. Every sell funds the vault. Volatility doesn’t hurt, it builds the floor. It’s a built in Flywheel effect: More volume → Bigger Treasury → Higher floor → More confidence → More volume This isn’t just a token, it’s a perpetual motion machine of value. This is a Treasury Coin.","links":"https://thetreasurycoinsol.com","market_cap":6536.46,"market_cap_rank":11970,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/treasury-coin_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"9zZWnw2DbJyxFZNa2Qhkh2a5zKDXmXnucdcTCyMkbunt","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/9zZWnw2DbJyxFZNa2Qhkh2a5zKDXmXnucdcTCyMkbunt"}},"is_native":false}
