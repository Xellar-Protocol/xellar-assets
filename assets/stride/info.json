{"name":"Stride","id":"stride","symbol":"strd","description":"Stride is a multichain liquid staking zone (appchain) on the Cosmos Blockchain. Stride allows users to stake any IBC-compatible tokens, and receive stTokens in return, which are redeemable for the original token at a 1:1 ratio. By staking their tokens using Stride, users will be able to earn staking rewards, while also retaining liquidity in the form of stTokens, which will allow them to take advantage of Cosmos DeFi and pursue more yields there. The Stride Token is the native governance token of the Stride Zone, allowing holders to vote on important decisions such as the distribution of staked tokens to each validator, the onboarding of new validators, and other protocol upgrades and improvements. The Stride Token can also be staked to secure the Stride Appchain.
