{"name":"Kyanite","id":"kyanite","symbol":"kyan","description":"Kyanite (KYAN) as a sister coin of Sapphire (SAPP) has emerged from a fork with SAPP. It is a payment coin similar to SAPP, but with the restriction that it can only be used for products and services for adults. The focus is on cash games and legal erotic services. Since such a coin has different requirements regarding age verification, marketing and discretion, we have decided to offer a separate coin for this use case.","links":"https://kyancoin.net/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kyanite/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
