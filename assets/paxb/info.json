{"name":"PAXB","id":"paxb","symbol":"paxb","description":"PAXB projects provide direct dApp ecosystems that work on smart contracts. The dApp ecosystem aims to eventually transform the advertising market by recruiting participants and sharing the virtual advertising market with them. PAXB coins are the native coins in the PAXB network and are used to support the establishment of a WEB 3.0 decentralized community within the PAXB ecosystem. PAXB coins are used for transaction fees and smart contract costs in the PAXB network. Users can exchange PAXB coins for PAXB dApp tokens at a rate determined by the dApp, and can also be rewarded directly from advertisers when performing virtual advertising missions.","links":"https://www.paxb.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/paxb/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
