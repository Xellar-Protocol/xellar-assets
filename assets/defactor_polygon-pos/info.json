{"name":"Defactor","id":"defactor_polygon-pos","symbol":"real","description":"Defactor is a modular toolkit powering the tokenization, financing, and on-chain management of real-world assets (RWAs). Designed for asset originators, institutions, and RWA-native projects, it enables users to create asset-backed tokens, borrow and lend against them, and access infrastructure such as staking, governance, and partner integrations. Built with production-ready smart contracts and API access, Defactor simplifies the complex RWA lifecycle, reducing time to market from months to weeks. Deployed across Ethereum, Polygon, Base, and more, it supports ERC20/ERC3643 standards, integrates with Chainlink and LayerZero, and is already used in live pools spanning real estate, commodities, and stablecoin-based savings. As the ecosystem transitions from the FACTR token to REAL, value accrues through protocol fees, utility, and rewards for active participation.","links":"https://defactor.com/","market_cap":3394250,"market_cap_rank":2415,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/defactor_polygon-pos/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe0bceef36f3a6efdd5eebfacd591423f8549b9d5","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/polygon_pos/tokens/0xe0bceef36f3a6efdd5eebfacd591423f8549b9d5"}},"is_native":false}
