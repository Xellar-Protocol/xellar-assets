{"name":"Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index","id":"bloomberg-galaxy-crypto-index_base","symbol":"bgci","description":"The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index DTF tracks the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index (“BGCI”). The BGCI is a benchmark designed to measure the performance of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization traded in USD. The Index is owned and administered by Bloomberg and co-branded with Galaxy Digital Capital Management. Index constituents are selected based on qualified exchange and daily liquidity qualifications set forth by BGCI rules. Each constituent represents a holding no more than 35% of the Index and no less than 1% of the Index’s overall value. Cryptocurrencies are considered for addition/removal to/from the Index on a monthly basis. Decentralized Token Folios (DTFs) are onchain portfolios that bundle multiple crypto assets into a single token. BGCI is an Index DTF deployed and curated by Re7 Labs on the Reserve Protocol (reserve.org), which supports two main DTF categories: Yield DTFs and Index DTFs.","links":"https://app.reserve.org/base/index-dtf/0x23418de10d422ad71c9d5713a2b8991a9c586443/overview","market_cap":59463,"market_cap_rank":7928,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bloomberg-galaxy-crypto-index/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x23418de10d422ad71c9d5713a2b8991a9c586443","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x23418de10d422ad71c9d5713a2b8991a9c586443"}},"is_native":false}
