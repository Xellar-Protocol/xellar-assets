{"name":"Leveraged frxETH","id":"leveraged-frxeth","symbol":"xfrxeth","description":"The xfrxETH token, also called leveraged frxETH, is a decentralized, composable leveraged long frxETH futures contract with a low risk of liquidations and 0 funding fee (and in extreme cases, xETH minters can earn fees). It’s a token to amplify your gains on a long-term bet on ETH price growth. As the price of the reserve token varies, so too does the amount of base token a user may redeem for each of the stable and volatile tokens. The stable token is held fixed at a USD value of $1, so as the price of stETH in the reserve rises, the volatile token price rises at a multiple rate of stETH. Based on the performance of xETH, this multiple generally varies between 1.5x — 4x though though it can rise as high as 4.3X before the protocol responds to limit it.","links":"https://fx.aladdin.club/earn/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/leveraged-frxeth/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x2bb0c32101456f5960d4e994bac183fe0dc6c82c"}}}
