{"name":"HyperAGI","id":"hyperdust","symbol":"hypt","description":"HyperAGI is a Web3 AI platform that anyone can participate in. It leverages off-chain GPU computing power through a concept called Smart Aspect, combining it with on-chain code to create trustworthy, aspect-oriented computing models. Building on the foundation of “trusted world computing,” it advances to “trusted world intelligence.”Trusted world intelligence includes reliable reasoning and a trustworthy world model. The Smart Aspect mechanism ensures that both reasoning and spatial computations are verifiable. The trusted world model incorporates AI alignment rules to reduce AI’s so-called “world hallucinations.” HyperAGI’s flagship AI agent, HyperAgent, is the world’s first AI capable of operating both via web pages and within immersive 3D virtual environments. HyperAgent not only understands text but can autonomously explore and act within realistic 3D simulated worlds. As an agent with a world model, it efficiently handles general tasks online or in virtual spaces—such as AI virtual societies, product equipment missions, commercial space design and layout, crypto market research, job applications, flight searches, data collection, and online document creation. The HyperAGI mainnet is built on Arbitrum Orbit L3 and uses the Arbitrum ERC-20 token $HYPT as its dedicated gas token. With a total supply of 210 million tokens, $HYPT primarily incentivizes builders of Smart Aspect— including GPU power providers and AI agent developers. $HYPT also supports 1:1 mapping for transactions, staking, and DeFi activities on Solana.","links":"https://www.hyperagi.ai/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/hyperdust/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
