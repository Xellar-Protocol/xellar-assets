{"name":"Hyperdust","id":"hyperdust","symbol":"hypt","description":"Hyperdust is Web3 3D/AI Microservice Platform for AGI. AI impacts every intelligent living being on this planet and its development also requires globally human collaboration. But weâ€™ve seen instances where AI has been promised as open but turns out to closed, where AI was intended to be used to improve human welfare but is used as monopoly. Do not trust any alliance on paper, trust no one, trust the code. Build AI with blockchain technologies. Make AI open again. Hyperdust has developed a decentralized 3D computing and AI microservices platform on the blockchain, allowing users to develop and use LLM-driven Agents. Hyperdust's key innovation is a decentrzlized protocol for on-chain verifiable 3D/AI computing. That turns off-chain intensive GPU computing as verifiable on-chain work. Permissionlessly, the GPU providers can claim token rewards by submitting verifiable correct computing results or be punished with wrong submitting, on the other hand the holders, developers and end users could instantly use those 3D/AI microservice running on GPUs just to pay gas fee in very small amounts of $HYPT token on the go. Let's build decentralized AI on blockchain.","links":"https://www.hyperdust.io/","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/hyperdust/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
