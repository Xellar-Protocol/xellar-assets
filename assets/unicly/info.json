{"name":"Unicly","id":"unicly","symbol":"unic","description":"Unicly is a permissionless, community-governed protocol to combine, fractionalize, and trade NFTs. Built by NFT collectors and DeFi enthusiasts, the protocol incentivizes NFT liquidity and provides a seamless trading experience for NFT assets. The UNIC token is going through a fair launch where tokens can only be minted through liquidity mining. The supply of UNIC will never reach 1 million, as inflation rate decreases each month. Token holders can govern the protocol by voting.","links":"https://unic.ly/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/unicly/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x94e0bab2f6ab1f19f4750e42d7349f2740513ad5"},"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x21ce5251d47aa72d2d1dc849b1bcce14d2467d1b"}}}
