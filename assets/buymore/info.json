{"name":"BuyMORE","id":"buymore","symbol":"more","description":"What about this description? (tweak if you want): MORE (ðŸŸ¢) is a decentralized virtual digital currency created by YouTube star, TrVon, Trevon James, that can be sent between users through the Ethereum and Pulse (launching soon) peer-to-peer networks, without the need for intermediaries like banks or governments. It is the new age of cryptocurrency, a growing asset class that shares some characteristics of traditional currencies, but has verification based on cryptography. The term â€˜MOREâ€™ can refer to the token (a snippet of code that represents ownership of a digital value). Trevon James has shown up time and time again for the past 7 years creating crypto content and sharpening his skills as well as his communities. The one thing MORE community requires is a dedicated and determined leader. An inspirational juggernaut the community can trust and look to for reassurance and guidance. And who better than to have that role than someone who we know is fully doxed, honest, isnâ€™t going to make empty promises or over sell you on anything. MORE has a capped supply of 21million tokens which were all minted at the same time. This means there will never have an unexpected supply shock. MORE is rare by design. Unlike the currencies issued by banks and governments, MORE is not vulnerable to losing its value if the centralized issuing authority breaks down. The decentralized system can continue to operate as long as there are members in the network. The managing of transactions and the issuing of MORE is carried out collectively by the Ethereum and Pulse networks. TrVon offered MORE airdrops to community members that verified subscriptions to his Patreon and YouTube accounts. He also offered airdrops to member that verified staking HEX in one of Tewkenaireâ€™s smart contacts.","links":"https://www.moretokens.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/buymore/logo.png"}
