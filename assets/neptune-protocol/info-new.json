{"name":"Neptune Protocol","id":"neptune-protocol","symbol":"npt","description":"Neptune Protocol is the decentralized, native stablecoin of Eclipse Network. By delivering a comprehensive, secure, and user-centric decentralized borrowing platform and offering 0% interest rates on loans, Neptune is creating a robust and reliable stablecoin. Neptune allows users to take out 0% interest loans for a one-time fee by depositing collateral for USDN. Users are incentivized to keep their collateral-to-debt ratio above 110%. Users are able to deposit multiple collateral types to create a Neptune vault, which allows them in return to take a loan from Neptune. The loan is issued in the platformâ€™s native stablecoin, USDN. Holders can use USDN to participate in DeFi activities, or they can stake their USDN to earn NPT rewards, which is Neptune's native utility token (which accrues yield in the form of Neptune's accepted collateral types).","links":"https://neptuneprotocol.xyz/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/neptune-protocol/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
