{"name":"Shield OS","id":"shield-os_solana","symbol":"shield","description":"ShieldOS is a privacy-first operating system built on Solana that gives users a secure, unified environment for managing every part of their digital life. Instead of relying on multiple centralized apps, ShieldOS provides an integrated suite of client-side-encrypted tools including a Vault, Authenticator, Drive, Mail, Chat, Browser, Link, and Pay. All authentication is wallet-based, with no accounts or passwords, and all sensitive data is encrypted locally before leaving the device. ShieldOS aims to give users full control over their identity, files, communication, and interactions without exposing information to centralized servers. It functions as a decentralized personal security layer designed to protect everything that happens outside the blockchain.","links":"https://www.shieldos.xyz/","market_cap":9753.15,"market_cap_rank":11237,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/shield-os_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"42ZFYwLMMbC5fNbbH641PgXeaEym5cJrmnAVho5Hpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/42ZFYwLMMbC5fNbbH641PgXeaEym5cJrmnAVho5Hpump"}},"is_native":false}
