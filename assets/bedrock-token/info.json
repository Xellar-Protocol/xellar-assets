{"name":"Bedrock","id":"bedrock-token","symbol":"br","description":"Bedrock DAO is a governance framework for managing decisions within the Bedrock ecosystem. It enables BR token holders to participate in governance by converting BR into veBR, a voting escrow token. Governance decisions include protocol parameters, incentive structures, and liquidity allocation. The governance system is based on veBR, which is obtained by locking BR tokens at a 1:1 ratio. The longer the lock duration, the greater the voting power. veBR holders vote on governance proposals, including gauge allocations that determine incentive distribution across liquidity pools.","links":"https://bedrockdao.com/","market_cap":16718726,"market_cap_rank":1229,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bedrock-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xff7d6a96ae471bbcd7713af9cb1feeb16cf56b41"},"berachain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd352dc6e5f0c45e2f2b38eb5565eb286a1ea4087"}}}
