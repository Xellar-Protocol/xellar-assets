{"name":"SLM.Games","id":"slm-games","symbol":"slm","description":"What is the project about? SLM.Games is a cross-chain crypto casino platform built around Bitcoin, Ethereum, BSC, EOS, WAX, TELOS, Solana and ThunderCore. It's primary objective is to strengthen the Web3 ecosystem and combine GameFi to provide the ecosystem with a more diversified gameplay and value. SLM is the internal play and earn token for the SLM.Games app. It has an unlimited supply and is earned by playing games in the app. When users consume SLM or upgrade their NFTs in the app, the tokens are burned. This means that the overall supply of SLM will decrease over time, potentially increasing its value for users who hold onto their tokens. What makes your project unique? History of your project.
