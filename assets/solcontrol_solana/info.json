{"name":"SolControl","id":"solcontrol_solana","symbol":"sctrl","description":"The Biggest Reward Project on Solana Recurring Solana Rewards Receive Sol every Hour, every Week, and Once at the end of the Month in a Large Payout SolCtrl represents a fundamental shift in how cryptocurrency tokens operate on the Solana blockchain. Rather than functioning as a simple reward or speculative asset, SolCtrl has been engineered to align the interests of all holders—from small holders to whales—toward the common goal of project growth and long-term success. The core innovation lies in a multi-faceted incentive structure that rewards holding, provides consistent returns, and offers a significant payout at the end of the month. This structure transforms the typical relationship users have with tokens, creating a community that chases project growth rather than short-term price movements. TOKENOMICS We are the first project in the history of DeFi to cover 100% of your buy fee. Experience the largest reward project while getting a bag larger than your original purchase when buying through the website.","links":"https://www.solctrl.com/","market_cap":166777,"market_cap_rank":6199,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/solcontrol/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"CTRLb9PmyRL2fQZ4amRKw6ydJXbTLc5LWvw83RqyjxBk","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/CTRLb9PmyRL2fQZ4amRKw6ydJXbTLc5LWvw83RqyjxBk"}},"is_native":false}
