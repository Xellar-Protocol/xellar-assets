{"name":"Torches","id":"torches","symbol":"tor","description":"Torches Finance is a decentralized lending protocol based on KCC that combines lending, leveraged mining and NFT. With the advantages of a low entry barrier, highly transparent smart contracts, an innovative economic model with incentives and DAO autonomy, Torches aims to reduce the impermanent loss further and increase the utilization of user assets. We launched on the KuCoin Community Chain(KCC) mainnet on 27 June 2022. Now we support mainstream crypto assets such as BTC, ETH, etc,. We have launched the Genesis NFT(Torchlight) and opened the Point Mining(the mining incentive). Our native token(TOR) will be listed soon and is expected to list on the Top centralized exchange. On 8 July 2022, we were invested by KuCoin Ventures, the leading investment arm of global crypto exchange KuCoin, and made a strategic cooperation with KuCoin Wallet. Our smart contract has been audited by PeckShield and both parties have made multiple optimizations on smart contract permissions, oracle mechanism, and operation logic.","links":"https://www.torches.finance/en","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/torches/logo.png"}
