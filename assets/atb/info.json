{"name":"ATB","id":"atb","symbol":"atb","description":"Introduction: ðŸ˜˜ATR Network ðŸ« With the introduction of concepts such as international digital currency, digital silk road, and enterprise chain reform, the short-term and fast nature of the digital economy (short cycle, stable prices, and fast transactions) still cannot effectively solve the security and privacy issues in data transactions and data storage. . On the basis of solving the problem of data protection and privacy security, ATR Network uses neural networks, deep learning and other technologies to deeply analyze heterogeneous data, extract useful data vectors, and integrate blockchain trust mechanisms and multi-modal time series through advanced technologies. Analysis and advanced privacy computing open up new fields of decentralized AI applications in the Web3.0 era, and are known as the \"Web3 AI\" supercomputing network.","links":"https://atrnetwork.xyz","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/atb/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb4d5841cb352be4b743283dd58b61ecd86655510"}}}
