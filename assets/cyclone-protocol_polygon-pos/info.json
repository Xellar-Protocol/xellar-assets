{"name":"Cyclone Protocol","id":"cyclone-protocol_polygon-pos","symbol":"cyc","description":"Cyclone is a multi-chain, non-custodial, privacy-preserving protocol. Cyclone applies zkSNARKs to enable transactional privacy by breaking the on-chain link between depositor and recipient addresses. It uses a smart contract that accepts coins/tokens deposits, which can be withdrawn by a different address. Whenever an asset is withdrawn from Cyclone, there is no way to link the withdrawal to the deposit for absolute privacy.","links":"https://cyclone.xyz/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cyclone-protocol/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xcfb54a6d2da14abecd231174fc5735b4436965d8"}},"is_native":false}
