{"name":"Okiku","id":"okiku","symbol":"okiku","description":"The Okiku cryptocurrency project draws its inspiration from the iconic Monkey Puppet meme, featuring Kenta from the Japanese children's television show ÅŒkiku Naru Ko. This meme captures the essence of curiosity and intrigue as the puppet playfully glances toward the camera before turning away, symbolizing the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. Unlike the original scene, the side-eye glance was ingeniously crafted using Photoshop when the meme emerged in 2016, highlighting the meme's ability to reshape perceptions. Okiku aspires to embody this spirit of creative transformation, aiming to bring innovation and engagement to the blockchain space without losing sight of the inherent unpredictability, akin to Kenta's whimsical glances. With a commitment to transparency and genuine development, Okiku's goals are rooted in establishing a vibrant and sustainable crypto ecosystem. The project's roadmap encompasses phases dedicated to building a robust foundation, including a live website, comprehensive whitepaper, and active social media presence. Moving forward, Okiku plans to introduce utility features, foster community engagement through meme and shilling contests, and connect with the community through AMAs. Ultimately, the project aims to achieve recognition on prominent cryptocurrency listing platforms like CoinGecko, emphasizing its dedication to credibility and accessibility in the cryptocurrency world.","links":"https://monkeyokiku.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/okiku/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x7199f1dffe926c8fd36567d8df6f41edb01bf632"}}}
