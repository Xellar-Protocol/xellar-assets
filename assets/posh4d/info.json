{"name":"PoSH4D","id":"posh4d","symbol":"p4d","description":"FOMO3D Arbitrum is a game in which the grand prize winner is the last person to purchase a key before the countdown timer runs down to zero. During a round, a timer is constantly counting down to zero. Every time a key is purchased, the buyer becomes the new \"holder of the private keys\" and additional time is added to the countdown. The price of the keys will get slightly more expensive with each purchase. When the timer reaches zero, the last person to have bought a key wins the round. The distribution of key purchases and the jackpot is determined by the teams selected by players. P4D is the fee-earning token of the FOMO3D Arbitrum protocol.
