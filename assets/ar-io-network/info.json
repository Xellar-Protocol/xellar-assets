{"name":"AR.IO Network","id":"ar-io-network","symbol":"ario","description":"AR.IO is the first decentralized permanent cloud network, built on Arweave's permaweb and powered by the AO decentralized computing protocol. AR.IO is designed to provide censorship-resistant, resilient access to immutable data, storage, and digital identities. It introduces incentivized gateways to facilitate efficient data uploads, retrieval, indexing, and querying. The network incorporates the Arweave Name System (ArNS), allowing users to create self-sovereign, human-readable smart domains linked permanently to digital content, applications, and identities. The ARIO token functions as a utility asset for staking, network rewards, and ArNS domain transactions, supporting the infrastructure’s scalability, sustainability, and resilience.","links":"https://ar.io","market_cap":2813735,"market_cap_rank":2939,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ar-io-network/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
