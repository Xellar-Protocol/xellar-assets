{"name":"MACARON","id":"macaron_solana","symbol":"macaron","description":"A next-gen mining protocol built by merging the core mechanisms of $DONUT and $ORE The goal of Macaron is to create a \"mining flywheel\" where users compete to mine tokens through different macaron flavors, each with unique mining rate, measured in the amount of $MACARON mined per second. Core Ideas Macaron Theme: The project uses macaron imagery to make mining fun and accessible. A 2x2 map represents a \"tray of pastries\" with 4 different macaron flavors, each as an independent \"mine slot\". Competitive Mining: Only one person can mine at each macaron flavor at a time. Users must bid to \"seize\" the position, creating competitive dynamics and transaction fees. Sustainable Tokenomics: Auction fees are distributed to incentivize holders, reduce supply, support staking, and platform fees.","links":"https://www.macaron.bid/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/macaron_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"8UiPofjkbjqTqrymz4VY3wXxMcPjFuyq3Psofekymaca","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/8UiPofjkbjqTqrymz4VY3wXxMcPjFuyq3Psofekymaca"}},"is_native":false}
