{"name":"Mindfolk Wood","id":"mindfolk-wood","symbol":"$wood","description":"\"THE $WOOD from the trees in the Forest Coppice Kingdom are as magical as the forest itself. Besides its potent smokeable bark that inspires new ideas for unique structures, the wood is stronger than any other form of lumber known to mankind; it does not splinter, will never rot, provides insolation in the coldest winters, and is able to withstand torrential storms, lightning strikes, and high winds from all directions. The Forest Spirits have proprietorship over all that grows in the Coppice Kingdom, and it is they who distribute the wood fairly among the Mindfolk founders. There is no hierarchy among the Mindfolk, and neither should there be. And so, as a reward-based token, the Forest Spirits share newly-grown wood equally among them daily. All founders need to do is refrain from entering the Dark Forest of Eden.... chop-chop, collect, then embark upon their quest to build those unique wooden creations from their dreams.\"","links":"https://www.mindfolk.art/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mindfolk-wood/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"674PmuiDtgKx3uKuJ1B16f9m5L84eFvNwj3xDMvHcbo7"}}}
