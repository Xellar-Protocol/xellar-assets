{"name":"Ethereum Express","id":"ethereum-express","symbol":"ete","description":"What is the project about? The Ethereum Express network is a faster, safer, and cheaper L1 network based on the underlying framework of the Ethereum EVM. What makes your project unique? We will build a blockchain browser independently, which will be more powerful and reliable than ETHscan over time. We will also build a wallet system and ETEswap on our network to make our customers more secure. We will abandon most of the original wormhole systems, and use CEXs（ERC20 & ETRC20）and third-party cross-chain partners to coordinate cross-chains, which is more secure and reliable. History of your project. What’s next for your project? Attract more users and developers. What can your token be used for? ETE(ETRC20)-Gas token and ETE(ERC20)-cross chain token","links":"https://www.ethereumexpress.net/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ethereum-express/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""},"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x000000e29fa2bd3e5c215ffc71aa66b29c9769a2"}}}
