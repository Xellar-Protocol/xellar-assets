{"name":"GameYoo","id":"gameyoo","symbol":"gyc","description":"GameYoo is a GameFi project that seeks to bridge the gap between traditional mobile gamers and blockchain-based gameplay, GameYoo seeks to leverage the power of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to give traditional in-game assets real value, utilizing Web3 to bring in a new generation of gaming. The GameYoo team believes that utilizing NFTs to give value to assets could revolutionize the gaming industry. As gamers enjoy the benefits of their in-game assets providing them potential profit, GameYoo proposes that a larger market share of gamers will begin to enter the blockchain gaming industry. In particular, the GameYoo team plans to focus on users in developing countries like Nigeria, Pakistan, and India, we believe that these countries have billions of young generations that have little experience with blockchain gaming, making them an excellent place to begin bridging the gap.","links":"https://www.gameyoo.com","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gameyoo/logo.png"}
