The platform will use an AI Tutor powered by the technology of OpenAI and Wolfram Alpha. It will be trained on a large database of peer-reviewed knowledge and fine-tuned for personal use. The access to the platform will be granted through the $token and verified with a web3 integration and the users’ crypto wallet. The platform will also offer help for developers to innovate new DeFi projects with the Astral Copilot. Project Astral was made by a team of developers who will combine OpenAI’s GPT-3 with Wolfram Alpha along with Text-to-Speech and Text-to-Video integration to create an AI Tutor that can not only provide an accurate and comprehensive educational material, but will also present it in a human-like interaction. ASTRAL’s database will be trained on a large, and constantly updated, peer-reviewed dataset of knowledge about blockchain, DeFi, and cryptocurrency. The project aims to decentralize access to knowledge and skills in the blockchain and crypto ecosystem, and provide a comprehensive and accessible education-hub for newcomers and experts to find available projects and solutions. The goal is to facilitate a large scale adoption of blockchain and crypto, and to restore trust. The $ASTRAL token will have utility within the platform, such as accessing premium services, and content and it will be used an internal payment system between users.","links":"https://projectastral.xyz/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/astral-ai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc74b43cc61b627667a608c3f650c2558f88028a1"}}}
