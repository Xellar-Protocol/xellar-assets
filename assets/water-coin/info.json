{"name":"WATER Coin","id":"water-coin","symbol":"water","description":"Global charity and research initiatives that will drive attention of millions of people. $WATER aims to have a net-positive impact on real world with the help of charity. $WATER introduces a unique and engaging game mechanic inspired by the states of waterâ€”staking (icing) and burning (vaporizing). FREEZING (STAKING) Just as water turns into ice when it gets cold, $WATER tokens can be staked (iced) to earn rewards. Stakers are rewarded with additional $WATER tokens over time, simulating the process of accumulating ice VAPORIZING (BURNING) When water is heated, it turns into vapor and disappears. Similarly, $WATER tokens can be burned (vaporized) to reduce the total supply, increasing scarcity and potentially the value of the remaining tokens.","links":"https://watercoin.wtf/","market_cap":2778201,"market_cap_rank":2336,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/water-coin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"B6h248NJkAcBAkaCnji889a26tCiGXGN8cxhEJ4dX391"}}}
