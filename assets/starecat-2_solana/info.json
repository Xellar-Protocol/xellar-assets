{"name":"Starecat","id":"starecat-2_solana","symbol":"starecat","description":"The Starecat image dates back to the mid-2000s, originally from breeder photos of a British Shorthair named Helia Peppercats. It first appeared online around 2004 to 2005 on Russian pet sites, but didn’t become a meme until 2010, when it spread on 4chan.
