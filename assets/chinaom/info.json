{"name":"ChinaOM","id":"chinaom","symbol":"com","description":"\"we present C-Chain, a novel blockchain network architecture that addresses all of these problems. C-Chain is a network of many independent blockchains, called zones. The zones are powered by Tendermint BFT , which provides a high-performance, consistent, secure PBFT-like consensus engine, where strict fork-accountability guarantees hold over the behaviour of malicious actors. The Tendermint BFT consensus algorithm is well suited for scaling public proof-of-stake blockchains.\"","links":"https://chinaom.net/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/chinaom/logo.png"}
