{"name":"ChinaOM","id":"chinaom","symbol":"com","description":"\"we present C-Chain, a novel blockchain network architecture that addresses all of these problems. C-Chain is a network of many independent blockchains, called zones. The zones are powered by Tendermint BFT , which provides a high-performance, consistent, secure PBFT-like consensus engine, where strict fork-accountability guarantees hold over the behaviour of malicious actors. The Tendermint BFT consensus algorithm is well suited for scaling public proof-of-stake blockchains.\"","links":"https://chinaom.net/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/chinaom/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x9d126a63709646bd68a32e7a4f3105df4c0d7e8d"}}}
