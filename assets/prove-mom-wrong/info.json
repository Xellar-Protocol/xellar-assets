{"name":"Prove Mom Wrong","id":"prove-mom-wrong","symbol":"$pmw","description":"The Prove Mom Wrong token project is centered around the narrative of proving one's worth, especially in the realm of cryptocurrency, against skepticism often personified by \"mom\" or traditional doubters. It's not just a memecoin but a movement celebrating those who've been underestimated. This token fosters a community where members share memes, engage in constant dialogue in a 24/7 Telegram voice chat, and support each other in their crypto endeavors. It started small on Pumpfun but has grown into a significant community, highlighting the journey from doubt to success, all while maintaining a humorous, defiant spirit. The token embodies the ethos of proving naysayers wrong through innovation, community strength, and the power of collective belief in crypto's potential.","links":"https://www.provemomwrong.com/","market_cap":7452.74,"market_cap_rank":11176,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/prove-mom-wrong/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"5wbXVaTboCifoDLTHydWrMX4fgL8dqc7rji6CCMnpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/5wbXVaTboCifoDLTHydWrMX4fgL8dqc7rji6CCMnpump"}}}
