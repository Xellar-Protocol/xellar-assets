{"name":"TREN Protocol Token","id":"tren-protocol-token","symbol":"tren","description":"Tren Finance is a stablecoin borrowing protocol that operates through a network of autonomous AI agents managing all protocol operations without human governance intervention. The protocol enables users to borrow against assets including LP tokens, money market deposits, and restaked positions, while also featuring Malone, the first peer-to-agent loan system where users interact directly with an AI agent that has its own EVM-compatible wallet. Malone enables borrowing against previously illiquid assets such as NFTs, vested token streams, and newly launched tokens through natural language conversation, providing personalized loan terms based on user history and asset evaluation completed within minutes. The protocol employs over 20 specialized AI agents that continuously analyze market conditions and optimize borrowing rates, assess collateral risk, and manage protocol parameters in real-time without requiring governance votes or manual adjustments.","links":"https://www.tren.finance/","market_cap":8639.72,"market_cap_rank":11043,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/tren-protocol-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa77e22bfaee006d4f9dc2c20d7d337b05125c282","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xa77e22bfaee006d4f9dc2c20d7d337b05125c282"}}}
