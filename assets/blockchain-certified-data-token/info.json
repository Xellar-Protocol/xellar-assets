{"name":"EvidenZ","id":"blockchain-certified-data-token","symbol":"bcdt","description":"Blockchain Certified Data Token (BCDT) is the token linked to the EvidenZ framework, used by the company BCdiploma to allow hundreds of institutions to issue diplomas in a digital, decentralized and secure way. The BCDT is required to issue each certificate on any blockchain. It is a utility token: for each certification, part of the BCDT used is burned by the smart contract of the EvidenZ ecosystem, reducing its total quantity. 40M BCDTs were issued during an ICO in January 2018: no more BCDTs will be issued after this date.","links":"https://www.evidenz.io/","market_cap":1315784,"market_cap_rank":2923,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/blockchain-certified-data-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xacfa209fb73bf3dd5bbfb1101b9bc999c49062a5"},"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8683e604cdf911cd72652a04bf9d571697a86a60"}}}
