{"name":"go fu*k yourself.","id":"go-fu-k-yourself_solana","symbol":"gfy","description":"The creation of the Go F*ck Yourself token was inspired by an interview with Elon Musk. It symbolizes the right of every individual to stand up against unfairness, political oppression, or economic pressures. This cryptocurrency represents freedom for those unafraid to challenge norms and break barriers. It also speaks to those who feel they have nothing left but the courage to say the right three words. Elon Musk has not only inspired the creation of our project but continues to serve as a thought leader for our community. While we don’t agree with him on everything, we recognize him as perhaps the only person in the world with both the intellect and financial resources to sustain a free speech platform like X. Together, our voice will be heard. Just as Elon Musk fearlessly expresses his views, GFY embodies the freedom to speak your mind without constraints. Join our community and help transform cryptocurrency into what it was always meant to be.","links":"https://gfyeth.com","market_cap":102910,"market_cap_rank":6945,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/go-fu-k-yourself_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"6CNkQVWLSRxZEa1eZ2PFjQyLCVZ48U9oGcggdS9cTJoK","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/6CNkQVWLSRxZEa1eZ2PFjQyLCVZ48U9oGcggdS9cTJoK"}},"is_native":false}
