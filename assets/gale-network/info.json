{"name":"Gale Network","id":"gale-network","symbol":"gale","description":"Gale is a high-yield certificate of deposit smart contract serving as a base protocol for building a suite of DeFi services. At its core, it is a hybrid of the two most successful passive income DeFi apps: HEX (Defi 2.0) and DRIP (Defi 3.0). Building on the success of these applications, GALE aims to extend revenue potential by adding other DeFi applications like a decentralized Launchpad and GALE lottery. GALE is designed to appreciate and serve as a store of value against traditional currencies that devalue over time. In addition, the GALE ecosystem supercharges GALE by offering stakers of GALE a host of DeFi services beginning with the GALE launchpad and lottery. Initially launched on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Cronos Network, GALE promises to be the first deflationary cross-chain staking platform offering daily compoundable ROI. Future launches on EVM compatible networks are planned.GALE is a fungible token with a primary staking function. By design, GALE is scarce and net deflationary. Stakers of GALE will: *Earn interest on their stake (1.2% paid per day for 365 days) *Earn up 7,700% in compounding interest *Get allocations to projects on the GALE launchpad *Get voting rights in decision making as pertains to the development of the GALE ecosystem *Gain access to other DeFi services (at discounted rates) to be offered via the GALE ecosystem","links":"https://gale.network/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gale-network/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x627e86e9ec832b59018bf91456599e752288aa97"}}}
