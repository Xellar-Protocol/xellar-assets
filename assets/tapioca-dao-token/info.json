{"name":"Tapioca DAO Token","id":"tapioca-dao-token","symbol":"tap","description":"The TAP token is the backbone of the Tapioca DAO token economy. TAP was carefully crafted to be sustainably distributed over a long-term horizon, feature a fixed supply, and have a focus on economic growth with minimal value leakage as the foremost design principals. The end goal, once TAP has been majority permeated is to reach a ubiquitous distribution of the TAP token to facilitate maximal decentralization of the Tapioca DAO ecosystem, and to have maximized value capture with all inflation. Notably, the supply of TAP is immutably preprogrammed to be finite and decay in inflation over time, there are also no emissions of TAP itself, and thus the Tapioca ecosystem features no liquidity mining program(s). The TAP token utilizes the LayerZero V2 OFT (Omnichain Fungible Token) token super-standard. This enables TAP to able to be transferred to and from any EVM or non-EVM network via a burn-and-mint model directly via its token contract- no bridges, wrappers, or other intermediaries needed. New TAP tokens are only injected into circulation through redemptions of oTAP call option incentives distributed in the DAO Share Options (DSO) incentive program.","links":"https://www.tapioca.xyz","market_cap":9947.29,"market_cap_rank":7369,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/tapioca-dao-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x2c650dab03a59332e2e0c0c4a7f726913e5028c1"}}}
