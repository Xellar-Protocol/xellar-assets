{"name":"ZKsync Staked ETH","id":"zksync-staked-eth","symbol":"zketh","description":"zkETH is a native ETH LST that delivers DeFi’s highest ETH staking yield to the Elastic Chain's users and builders. By minting zkETH, users gain access to the yields available to apxETH holders on Ethereum mainnet—without leaving the Elastic Chain. zkETH is an “index token” designed to appreciate in value against ETH over time. When users withdraw back to ETH, the accumulated yield is included automatically. No need to track rebases or wrap tokens—just use zkETH in DeFi on the Elastic Chain as you normally would.","links":"https://zksync.dinero.xyz/","market_cap":30610,"market_cap_rank":9288,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/zksync-staked-eth/logo.png","detail_platform":{"zksync":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb72207e1fb50f341415999732a20b6d25d8127aa","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/zksync/tokens/0xb72207e1fb50f341415999732a20b6d25d8127aa"}}}
