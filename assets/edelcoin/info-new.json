{"name":"Edelcoin","id":"edelcoin","symbol":"edlc","description":"Edelcoin, a groundbreaking payment/asset token backed by the abundance of the Wealth of the Earth. This unique hybrid token ushers in a new era of real-world assets on the blockchain. It is designed as a Swiss compliant digital means of payment for goods and services. With its meticulously curated basket of existing precious and base metals, Edelcoin falls under the widely recognized category of «stablecoin». Unlike a single asset-backed token, the diversified composition of metals supporting Edelcoin ensures reduced volatility, making it a stable and reliable store of wealth. It operates independently from inflationary fiat currencies and from monetary policies. The Edelcoin token is issued as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum blockchain on the primary market, with plans for expansion to additional EVM-compatible chains. It can be traded on both centralized and decentralized crypto exchanges (secondary market), providing users with a wide range of options. To further enhance its stability, each Edelcoin is backed by an over-collateralization of pre-existing metals. This means that each coin possesses a surplus reserve of backing metals, totalling 125% of the actual metal reserves. The reserves undergo regular independent verification, evaluation, and disclosure, ensuring transparency and accountability.","links":"https://edelcoin.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/edelcoin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0xc47ef9b19c3e29317a50f5fbe594eba361dada4a"}}}
