{"name":"Cube Staked BABY","id":"cube-staked-baby","symbol":"cbaby","description":"Cube by SatLayer is a liquid staking protocol built on Babylon Genesis, a Cosmos-based blockchain. It allows users to stake BABY, Babylon’s native token, and receive cBABY in return — a liquid staking token (LST) that represents their staked position. cBABY accrues staking rewards over time while remaining liquid and usable across DeFi. The goal is to unlock liquidity, capital efficiency and participation in DeFi opportunities for BABY holders while maintaining full staking participation in Babylon’s consensus.","links":"https://cube.satlayer.xyz","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cube-staked-baby/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":null},"babylon-genesis":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"bbn17y5zvse30629t7r37xsdj73xsqp7qsdr7gpnh966wf5aslpn66rq5ekwsz"}}}
