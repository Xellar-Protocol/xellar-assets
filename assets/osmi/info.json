{"name":"OSMI","id":"osmi","symbol":"osmi","description":"OSMI is a bias-free, censorship resistant AI assistant, powered by a decentralized AI engine - a network of globally distributed GPU and memory nodes, known as OSMI Nodes. OSMIâ€™s distributed computing network (DePIN) enables scalable training, decentralized Inference, and low latency responses, all while optimizing usage, contributing to environment sustainability. At OSMI, we believe the future of AI is far too important to be solely in the hands of few powerful, disingenuous corporations. OSMI was built to provide a decentralized alternative to problematic mainstream AI assistants.","links":"https://osmi.ai","market_cap":17475309,"market_cap_rank":1490,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/osmi/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x5485a469faea1492191cfce7528ab6e58135aa4d"}}}
