With ambitions to ignite a 3D meme revolution, 3D MAN aims to pioneer the first 3D token launchpad on Solana, utilizing $MAN and SOL as trading pairs for new 3D-based tokens to drive demand and enhance $MAN’s value. Though currently lacking direct utility, the project thrives on a passionate community of traders united in crafting a groundbreaking crypto meta from scratch. The team’s transparency, with doxxed members, and plans for AI-enhanced 3D graphics and videos further fuel its momentum, positioning 3D MAN as a bold contender in the meme coin space.","links":"https://3dmansol.com","market_cap":6809.77,"market_cap_rank":11249,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/man-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"EQXXWLEoSa3ZKNuFp2TACKH9JVwv259keAJY9aXEqhQU","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/EQXXWLEoSa3ZKNuFp2TACKH9JVwv259keAJY9aXEqhQU"}}}
