{"name":"FamilyParty","id":"familyparty","symbol":"fpc","description":"\"FamilyParty is a game integration platform that integrates Metaverse „ÄÅNFTand GameFi, and leads players to experience Metaverse through various games. FamilyPartyCoin (FPC) is the only governance token on the platform. FPC holders can participate in the governance of the game ecology on the platform. We hope that FamilyParty will become a platform that is truly governed by the community. FPC is the base currency of independent game products. When a new game is released, FPC can be used to purchase the NFT mystery box of the new game. The overall mechanism of FPC is a deflation model, and the NFT trading market will charge transaction fees to repurchase and destroy FPC. The IDO module of the platform will introduce a pledge system. Users need to pledge a certain amount of FPC to obtain different identity levels, so as to obtain corresponding IDO quotas.\"","links":"https://www.familyparty.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/familyparty/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf080021c07fb6f55a5f2954ce8f11cedb25821ee"}}}
