{"name":"Chain-Fox","id":"chain-fox-2_solana","symbol":"cfx","description":"Chain-Fox is a blockchain security and automated auditing platform designed to help developers and users identify vulnerabilities in smart contracts and on-chain programs before they become serious risks. The platform analyzes GitHub repositories and Web3 project contracts using automated detectors, static analysis, and language models trained on common security patterns. Chain Fox provides clear reports that highlight issues such as unsafe patterns, incorrect logic, risky dependencies, and potential attack vectors. The goal of the project is to make high quality security checks accessible, fast, and simple for teams building on blockchain networks. Chain Fox removes unnecessary barriers by allowing users to request reports without registration and offers a frictionless pipeline that will later support x402 powered payments for automated audits.","links":"https://reports.chain-fox.com/","market_cap":36755,"market_cap_rank":8687,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/chain-fox-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"Fo9wJVqWYXEgsG3UKekvK1R7YVewyUGodRfBrmjaBAGS","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/Fo9wJVqWYXEgsG3UKekvK1R7YVewyUGodRfBrmjaBAGS"}},"is_native":false}
