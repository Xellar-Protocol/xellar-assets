{"name":"The Spirit of Gambling","id":"the-spirit-of-gambling","symbol":"tokabu","description":"Tokabu is used as a symbolic badge, a representation of those who live for thrill, chance, and crypto chaos. It powers community engagement, enables access to social rituals and themed events, and serves as a tool for self-expression within the ecosystem. Holding Tokabu is less about function and more about feeling: it’s a wager on the wild, a commitment to fun, and a way to join a community that doesn’t take itself too seriously; except when it comes to the memes.","links":"https://tokabu.art","market_cap":39399334,"market_cap_rank":924,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/the-spirit-of-gambling/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"H8xQ6poBjB9DTPMDTKWzWPrnxu4bDEhybxiouF8Ppump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/H8xQ6poBjB9DTPMDTKWzWPrnxu4bDEhybxiouF8Ppump"}}}
