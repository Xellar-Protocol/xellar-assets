{"name":"Pleasing Gold","id":"pleasing-gold_arbitrum-one","symbol":"pgold","description":"Pleasing Golden is an RWA platform that transforms precious metals into liquid, yield-generating tokens accessible to anyone, anywhere. Pleasing Golden’s vision is to make gold ownership open, liquid, and collaborative. Through tokenization and a suite of liquidity-sharing programs—including DeFi liquidity leasing and Tokenization-as-a-Service—the brand transforms slow, closed markets into dynamic, programmable assets that can circulate instantly among builders, traders, and holders. Pleasing Gold (PGOLD) is the tokenized gold of Pleasing Golden, each representing one troy ounce of LBMA-certified physical gold. It has a few features: - Unlimited physical redemption: holders can redeem PGOLD for allocated bars of nearly any size in Hong Kong, with expansion planned across greater APAC and Dubai. - Fractional access and 24/7 liquidity: trade gold globally from as little as 0.01 oz, powered by Chainlink data and infrastructure. - Instant settlement: PGOLD can be converted into stablecoins in real time, providing seamless transitions between gold and stable exposure.","links":"https://www.pleasinggold.com/","market_cap":84865378,"market_cap_rank":464,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pleasing-gold_arbitrum-one/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x3e76bb02286bfeaa89dd35f11253f2cbce634f91","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/arbitrum/tokens/0x3e76bb02286bfeaa89dd35f11253f2cbce634f91"}},"is_native":false}
