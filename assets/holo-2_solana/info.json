{"name":"HOLO","id":"holo-2_solana","symbol":"holo","description":"HOLO is more than just another memecoin — it’s a descent into the Abyss. Forged on Pump.fun and born on Solana, HOLO launches through a bonding curve before finding life in community-driven liquidity pools. Every trade channels creator fees through the canonical pool, fueling growth and sustainability. But HOLO is not defined by mechanics alone — it’s a living story. Inspired by the layers of the Abyss, each stage of the journey reveals relics, dangers, and challenges that mirror the unpredictable nature of crypto itself. From the euphoria of pumps and the chaos of FOMO to the trials of bleeding charts and FUD, HOLO is a reflection of what it means to venture deeper into the unknown. This token is both lore and movement. It invites holders to stop being passive spectators and instead become part of a community that dares to explore, build, and endure together. HOLO is not just held in your wallet — it is carried in your resolve. Stop thinking. Start doing. Begin the descent.","links":"https://holotoken.fun","market_cap":108022,"market_cap_rank":6852,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/holo-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"8HWLLoctYa7aFttfpHP9zbcEgV9uB9MUoVvSLjhBpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/8HWLLoctYa7aFttfpHP9zbcEgV9uB9MUoVvSLjhBpump"}},"is_native":false}
