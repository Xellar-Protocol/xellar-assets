{"name":"FriendSniper","id":"friendsniper","symbol":"fsnipe","description":"friendsniper is a telegram bot that lets users trade friend.tech (FT) keys, specifically by being the fastest publicly available platform for users to buy keys after registering with FT. You can also trade keys normally through the bot - avoiding the need to interact with the FT platform entirely if desired. FSNIPE's tokenomics aim to synergise the bot with the token. Holding the token can enable discounted or fee-free use of the bot. It also allows holders to claim revenue sharing. 100% of the bot fees are returned to token holders, as well as 25% of tax revenue generated (1.25% of total trading volume). friend.tech is a rapidly growing platform, and we aim to fill the space as a platform for users to trade keys without encountering with the lag that occurs through the official FT platform, whilst utilising a range of trading tools unavailable otherwise.","links":"https://friendsniper.tech/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/friendsniper/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x987041fb536942bbc686ad7dbc7046d277881fee"}}}
