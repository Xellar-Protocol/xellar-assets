{"name":"x402jobs","id":"x402jobs_solana","symbol":"jobs","description":"x402jobs is a platform for creating, running, and monetizing structured automated workflows as pay-per-use APIs using the x402 payment standard. The project allows developers to bundle one or more programmable steps—such as data collection, content generation, analysis, or on-chain interactions—into a single executable “job.” Each job can be triggered manually, on a schedule, via webhook, or by another agent or application. Every execution includes a fixed platform fee and optional pricing set by the job creator. The core purpose of x402jobs is to provide a practical marketplace where software agents and humans can invoke reliable, repeatable automation without subscriptions, long-term contracts, or trust assumptions. Jobs are registered as x402 resources, making them discoverable, composable, and payable using standardized, machine-readable payment rails.","links":"https://x402.jobs","market_cap":1822562,"market_cap_rank":3077,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/x402jobs/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"6cNcXWqYvK9nhD1TsjJ1ZH1KATXcaPaRJtZPHyVkJoBs","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/6cNcXWqYvK9nhD1TsjJ1ZH1KATXcaPaRJtZPHyVkJoBs"}},"is_native":false}
