{"name":"SEED","id":"seed-4_solana","symbol":"seed","description":"SEED is a launch and growth engine designed to improve the success rate of new token launches. It provides a structured, end-to-end framework covering liquidity setup, stable-led KOL campaigns, market support, and user acquisition. SEED manages launch operations, protects early liquidity, and reinvests revenue into buybacks and ecosystem growth. The goal is to create sustainable post-launch performance rather than short-term spikes, giving projects a managed path from TGE through early traction.","links":"https://www.launchwithseed.com/","market_cap":964651,"market_cap_rank":3796,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/seed-4_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"6xmo7F4DgFWd2q5xqn4vRqnmP9qSe6Ar3bsNM63S4exn","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/6xmo7F4DgFWd2q5xqn4vRqnmP9qSe6Ar3bsNM63S4exn"}},"is_native":false}
