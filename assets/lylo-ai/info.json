{"name":"Lylo.ai","id":"lylo-ai","symbol":"lylo","description":"Lylo — First AI UX for crypto, built as a Cosmos-based L1 for cross-chain execution. Lylo is the first AI-native UX layer for crypto—where users speak a prompt, and execution happens instantly across every chain. As a Cosmos L1, Lylo abstracts the complexity of multi-chain DeFi into a single, conversational interface. No dashboards. No toggles. No code. Just pure intent-to-action automation. Lylo transforms how both users and developers interact with on-chain systems. At the core is an AI agent that parses natural language into deterministic execution graphs and dispatches them through Lylo Chain—an IBC-native execution layer. The result is verifiable, cross-chain automation that feels like Web2 but functions with full Web3 composability and transparency.","links":"https://lylo.ai/","market_cap":64518,"market_cap_rank":8121,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/lylo-ai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x1ce9345d16cd3f9332438fc2c18dfa6556c5658e","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x1ce9345d16cd3f9332438fc2c18dfa6556c5658e"}}}
