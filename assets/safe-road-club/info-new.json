{"name":"Safe Road Club","id":"safe-road-club","symbol":"src","description":"The SRC.ai project is an AI-powered web3 application focused on data monetization in the autonomous driving and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) sector. It aims to solve the challenge of obtaining high-quality, diverse, and representative driving data, which is crucial for developing autonomous vehicles and related technologies. SRC.ai utilizes a decentralized, blockchain-based platform to crowdsource data from users worldwide. Drivers can upload dashcam recordings and GPS data through a gamified application, earning rewards in the form of SRC tokens. The collected data is processed by an AI pipeline and made available to researchers and companies via a decentralized marketplace. This helps develop Large Language Models (LLMs) and vision models that are vital for autonomous driving. The platform addresses challenges like data privacy, security, and inefficiencies in data acquisition by using blockchain technology to ensure data integrity and transparencyâ€‹","links":"https://saferoadclub.app","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/safe-road-club/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"5gkd3yk3WmTEjYxiTsCXk3p8uPd9W85L5UNYNUQaheyb"}}}
