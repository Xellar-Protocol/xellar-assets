{"name":"Kapital DAO","id":"kapital-dao","symbol":"kap","description":"What is the Kapital DAO? The Kapital DAO is the leading provider of web3 gaming asset management tech, with top brands like Yield Guild Games (YGG) and others already using the platform to scale. The platform features key innovations around \"hierarchical delegation\" that enable multiple layers of institutional control in which admins own assets and delegate to managers, who then subdelegate to players â€“ this framework is unique to our protocol, and does not readily exist elsewhere in the space. No technical lift is required from games to list inside of the protocol, as it works at the wallet level as a unique \"post-production\" solution. Over 50+ games have signed partnerships with the platform to drive higher user engagement. All platform fees are either charged in the KAP token or taken in exogenous tokens and then converted into the KAP token. Kapital DAO Highlights: *Building in close partnership with YGG and other key web3 gaming industry players *Support & investment from Solana, Polygon, Algorand, HBAR, Near, and others *Retained core contributors from key institutions like MIT, Stanford, Goldman Sachs, and Columbia University *Smart contract audits by Halborn and Ackee, and on-going penetration testing by Halborn KAP Token Utility: *Asset management transaction fees *In-app NFT placement promotions *Accelerated game listings *Liquidity staking *Social voting on partnerships or acquisitions *Social rewards and incentives","links":"https://kapital.gg/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kapital-dao/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x9625ce7753ace1fa1865a47aae2c5c2ce4418569"}}}
