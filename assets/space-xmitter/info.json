{"name":"Space Xmitter","id":"space-xmitter","symbol":"sx","description":"he Space Xmitter project was inspired by the world's most legendary company, SpaceX, and its founder Musk, who was on the verge of failure and bankruptcy for several years before achieving great success. New companies are born every day in Silicon Valley, and many go bankrupt, but it is in this constant grind that technology giants such as Apple, Google and Facebook emerge.While space Xmitter is a project inspired by Musk's tireless spirit and is conducted in a completely open and transparent manner.50% of the entire platform proceeds will be invested when Musk's spaceX opens a new round of funding, and the stocks and dividends earned will be distributed in the form of tokens to players who hold Space Xmitter NFT. Space Xmitter is a pure contract game platform to earn while playing, all playing rules are on the contract, there is no loophole, all contract games only use small amount of money to participate, gather less into more, achievement of the crowd, to create a completely free and fair contract game platform. Our vision is the same as Musk's - to take to the skies and \"see the planet like never before\".","links":"https://spacex.date/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/space-xmitter/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x96eb50804d0ef2790f2e1a33670feff6040cf89d"}}}
