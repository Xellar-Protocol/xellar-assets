If you're tired of this market, let's redefine meme together. Kabosu is a female Shiba Inu most famously known as the face of Doge. Kabosu was born in November 2nd, 2005 in a Japanese pedigree puppy mill that was promptly shut down, leaving Kabosu stranded in one of Japan’s many animal shelters. The owner of Kabosu, Atsuko Sato, rescued her in 2008, saving her from certain death at the hands of humanity. Her name was given by a shelter volunteer – Kabosu is a type of fruit and said rescue worker mentioned that her face was very round, just like the fruit.
