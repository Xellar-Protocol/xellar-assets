{"name":"Sentio AI","id":"sentio-protocol_ethereum","symbol":"sen","description":"Build powerful autonomous on-chain AI agents. What is Sentio? Sentio is a no-code platform and marketplace for creating on-chain AI agents. We enable anyone—regardless of coding experience—to build and monetize autonomous smart contracts that interact with blockchains, DeFi protocols, NFTs, and more. How does Sentio’s no-code builder work? Our drag-and-drop interface lets you visually design your AI agent’s logic, inputs, and outputs. You can configure tasks like trading, yield farming, or data analysis without writing any code. Then, you simply deploy the agent on-chain with one click. Do I need any programming skills to use Sentio? No. Sentio is designed to be beginner-friendly, so you don’t need prior coding experience. Our intuitive tools guide you through creating and testing your agent step-by-step. How do I monetize my agents? Once you deploy an agent to the Sentio Marketplace, you can set fees or a revenue-sharing model. Each time your agent executes a transaction for other users or provides services, you earn a share of the generated fees. Which blockchain networks are supported? Sentio supports major networks such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Solana. We also integrate with popular DeFi protocols like Uniswap, Aave, Curve, and PancakeSwap—so you can build agents for various ecosystems.","links":"https://sentio.ai/","market_cap":428208,"market_cap_rank":4804,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/sentio-protocol/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x421b05cf5ce28cb7347e73e2278e84472f0e4a88","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x421b05cf5ce28cb7347e73e2278e84472f0e4a88"}},"is_native":false}
