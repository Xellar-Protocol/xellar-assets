{"name":"Banana Task Force Ape","id":"banana-task-force-ape","symbol":"btfa","description":"\"Banana Task Force Ape is a native token of the BTFA NFT collection, a collection of 10,000 task force apes with over 150 unique traits that are deflationary. Our native token will be bridging the gap between Web 3, NFTs, and real-time ownership. $BTFA gives holders special access to our private NFT discord, which you will be able to connect and network with fellow peers. Also, it acts as membership access to future IDOs if their wallet passes risk assessments. BTFA tokenomics consists of 2% distributed to liquidity and 8% allocated to the marketing wallet from every transaction. The results ensure that not only are we able to keep the chart healthy by proper liquidity distribution, but we can also focus on proper marketing and development.\"","links":"https://bananataskforceape.com","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/banana-task-force-ape/logo.png"}
