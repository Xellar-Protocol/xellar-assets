{"name":"Horizon","id":"horizon-4","symbol":"hrz","description":"Horizon is a synthetic trading exchange designed to allow users to speculate on the price movements of various assets without owning the underlying assets themselves. Instead of trading liquid assets, users enter into contracts that track asset prices, enabling exposure to markets like stocks, commodities, cryptocurrencies, or index.
