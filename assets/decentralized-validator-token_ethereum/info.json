{"name":"Decentralized Validator Token","id":"decentralized-validator-token_ethereum","symbol":"dvsteth","description":"DVstETH is a wrapped Liquid Staking Token powered by the Lido protocol’s wstETH, allowing vault depositors to reuse their staking receipts across the DeFi ecosystem. Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) enables splitting of a validator's private key into multiple key shards, which are distributed among an independent cluster of nodes. This means no single node has access to the entire key, greatly enhancing validator key security. DVstETH users receive token incentives from the DVT providers whose validators are active in the Lido Protocol via the Simple DVT and Community Staking modules. As more DVT-based validators are activated via Lido, the vault will accrue an increasing amount of incentives.","links":"https://app.mellow.finance/vaults/ethereum-dvsteth","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/decentralized-validator-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x5e362eb2c0706bd1d134689ec75176018385430b","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x5e362eb2c0706bd1d134689ec75176018385430b"}},"is_native":false}
