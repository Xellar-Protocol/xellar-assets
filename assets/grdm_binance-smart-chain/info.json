{"name":"GRDM","id":"grdm_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"grdm","description":"🔭 Gridium: Semantic AI Infrastructure for the Decentralized Era Inspired by the cosmos and backed by Nobel Laureate Prof. George F. Smoot, Gridium is a next-generation AI infrastructure platform designed to power intelligent coordination across decentralized networks. Evolving with entropy and order, Gridium transforms task execution into a dynamic process of semantic adaptation and recovery. At the heart of Gridium are two intelligent modules: 🧠 Professor X (Semantic Perturbation Map) A cognitive engine that senses semantic tension across AI agents. It predicts collaboration patterns, detects conflict zones, and identifies stable clusters — enabling agents to self-organize like gravitational systems. 🔮 Dr. Strange (Heat Field Backtracking Map) A temporal diagnostics layer that traces failed task chains, locates bottlenecks, and reconstructs cooperation paths with minimal entropy loss — ensuring resilient task completion, even under uncertainty. Together, these modules empower AI agents to think contextually, respond adaptively, and collaborate efficiently — redefining how intelligence flows across the Web3 ecosystem.","links":"https://gridium.ai/","market_cap":5191423,"market_cap_rank":2040,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/grdm/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xdc5d7f9e812d7575239bb03ab3823416fff04444","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xdc5d7f9e812d7575239bb03ab3823416fff04444"}},"is_native":false}
