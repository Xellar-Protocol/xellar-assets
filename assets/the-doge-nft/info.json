{"name":"Own The Doge","id":"the-doge-nft","symbol":"dog","description":"Own The Doge (ownthedoge.com) is the official Doge project, community, and token ($DOG) directly linked to The Doge NFT, endorsed by Atsuko Sato, the owner of Kabosu — the Shiba Inu behind the iconic Doge meme. As a provenance coin, $DOG is backed by the original Doge meme, purchased on-chain from Atsuko Sato, granting exclusive Doge IP rights to Own The Doge. This has enabled partnerships with entities like Revolut and D3 (.doge domains), and the creation of Doge-themed collectibles. Organized as a Doge fan club with DAO governance, holders can vote and submit grants for Doge-related public goods and cultural projects, such as a Hollywood-backed Doge documentary, the annual Doge Day on November 2nd, a bronze statue replica of the meme photo in Tokyo, and sending The Doge NFT to space on SpaceX’s DOGE-1 mission. Committed to 'Do Only Good Everyday,' the community has donated millions to charity, including being the largest crypto donor to Save The Children.","links":"https://ownthedoge.com/","market_cap":16881515,"market_cap_rank":1223,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/the-doge-nft/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xbaac2b4491727d78d2b78815144570b9f2fe8899"},"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x4425742f1ec8d98779690b5a3a6276db85ddc01a"},"optimistic-ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8f69ee043d52161fd29137aedf63f5e70cd504d5"},"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xaa88c603d142c371ea0eac8756123c5805edee03"},"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xeee3371b89fc43ea970e908536fcddd975135d8a"},"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xafb89a09d82fbde58f18ac6437b3fc81724e4df6"},"solana":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"B9u8h65uM1oifqmP82VyUDb68iG2fKfZiyubmNMtu3h7"}}}
