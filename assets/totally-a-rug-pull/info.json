{"name":"Totally A Rug Pull","id":"totally-a-rug-pull","symbol":"tarp","description":"Our goal is to ensure the safety of all crypto investors by creating an iOS/Android app that will automatically check for red flags in any token by simply entering the contract address! TARP SCORE With the launch of our contract reader app, we will be introducing the “TARP Score”. Once the app has completed its automated assessment of a contract, it will generate a TARP Score that will range from 0 (BAD) to 100 (GOOD) determining the relative risk or safety of the token. DETAILS The TARP Contract Reader app distinguishes itself from all competitors by advancing contract risk evaluation to the next level. Not only will it generate a TARP Score, but it will also provide detailed explanations for every red flag, so the potential risk is clear and easy to understand.","links":"http://www.totallyarugpull.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/totally-a-rug-pull/logo.png"}
