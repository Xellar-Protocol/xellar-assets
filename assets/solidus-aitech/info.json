What is Solidus Ai Tech? Solidus Ai Tech, represented by AITECH, stands as a pioneering force in the realm of high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence. This deflationary AI utility token is designed to facilitate seamless access to a variety of services, including a GPU Marketplace and an AI Marketplace, all while being traded on centralized exchanges like KuCoin. At the heart of Solidus Ai Tech is its eco-friendly HPC Data Centre, spanning 8,000 square feet in Europe. This facility provides the computational backbone for complex AI projects, offering high-performance GPUs that can be rented on a secure, user-friendly platform. Users can access exactly what they need without upfront costs, benefiting from powerful processing capabilities at competitive rates. The AI Marketplace further enhances the ecosystem by offering a range of impactful AI tools. These tools are categorized into Foundational AI Models, AI Agents, and Standalone AI Solutions, enabling businesses and individuals to automate various activities efficiently. AITECH also powers the AITECH Pad Launchpad, a gateway for early-stage projects with a strong focus on AI and infrastructure. Stakers of AITECH tokens gain tiered access to seed, private, and public rounds, allowing them to participate in high-potential project launches. The token itself is integral to the Solidus AI Tech ecosystem, enabling seamless service procurement. Conventional payment methods are accepted, with fiat transactions converted to AITECH on the blockchain. An unlimited burn mechanism ensures a percentage of tokens used for services are systematically removed from the supply, maintaining the deflationary nature of AITECH. What is the technology behind Solidus Ai Tech? Solidus Ai Tech, symbolized by AITECH, represents a groundbreaking fusion of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence. At its core, the technology behind Solidus Ai Tech is a decentralized peer-to-peer network that allows users to access computing resources from other users. This decentralized approach ensures that computational power is distributed across a network, making it more resilient and efficient. The blockchain on which Solidus Ai Tech operates is designed to be transparent and secure. Blockchain technology inherently prevents attacks from bad actors through its decentralized nature. Each transaction or data entry is recorded in a block, which is then linked to the previous block, forming a chain. This chain is immutable, meaning once data is recorded, it cannot be altered without altering all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus from the majority of the network. This makes it extremely difficult for any single entity to manipulate the data, ensuring the integrity and security of the information. Solidus Ai Tech has built an eco-friendly High-Performance Computing (HPC) Data Centre spanning 8,000 square feet in Europe. This facility is designed to provide the necessary infrastructure for AI and blockchain innovation. The AITECH token, which is the world’s first deflationary AI infrastructure utility token, powers this ecosystem. The deflationary nature of AITECH means that a portion of the tokens used for transactions is systematically burnt, reducing the total supply over time and potentially increasing the value of the remaining tokens. The GPU Marketplace is a significant component of Solidus Ai Tech's ecosystem. It allows users to access high-performance GPUs for various tasks, from cloud gaming to complex AI projects. Users can rent the exact amount of processing power they need without any upfront costs, making it a flexible and cost-effective solution for both individuals and businesses. In addition to the GPU Marketplace, Solidus Ai Tech offers an AI Marketplace. This platform provides a range of AI tools designed to automate everyday business and personal activities. The tools are categorized into three main solutions: Foundational AI Models, AI Agents, and Standalone AI Solutions. This categorization helps users find the right tools for their specific needs, enhancing productivity and efficiency. The AITECH Pad Launchpad serves as a gateway for early-stage projects, particularly those focused on AI and infrastructure. By staking AITECH tokens, users gain tiered access to seed, private, and public rounds of these high-potential projects. This not only provides funding opportunities for innovative projects but also integrates them into the Solidus Ai Tech ecosystem, creating a symbiotic relationship between the platform and its users. Solidus Ai Tech has formed strategic partnerships with companies like SambaNova Systems to further advance its capabilities. These partnerships bring additional expertise and resources, enhancing the overall functionality and reach of the platform. The integration of conventional payment methods, with fiat currency transactions seamlessly converted to AITECH on the blockchain, ensures that the platform is accessible to a broader audience. The unlimited burn mechanism is another innovative feature of Solidus Ai Tech. A percentage of AITECH tokens used for purchasing services is systematically burnt out of the supply. This continuous reduction in supply helps maintain the deflationary nature of the token, potentially increasing its value over time.","links":"https://aitech.io","market_cap":53663501,"market_cap_rank":775,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/solidus-aitech/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x2d060ef4d6bf7f9e5edde373ab735513c0e4f944","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x2d060ef4d6bf7f9e5edde373ab735513c0e4f944"},"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd71552d9e08e5351adb52163b3bbbc4d7de53ce1","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xd71552d9e08e5351adb52163b3bbbc4d7de53ce1"},"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"FUW4poh6s7uychceF8u1mo7NS65vzjX5vmS7Yi7GYQnz","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/FUW4poh6s7uychceF8u1mo7NS65vzjX5vmS7Yi7GYQnz"}}}
