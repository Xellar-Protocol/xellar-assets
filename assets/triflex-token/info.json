{"name":"Triflex","id":"triflex-token","symbol":"trfx","description":"Triflex Token is a community driven, deflationary utility token deployed on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC-BEP20). $TRFX is the fundamental token of the Triflex Ecosystem consisting of a series of smart contracts that make up the Triflex Protocol. The deflationary nature of the token contract will be achieved via a Buy Back and Burn from the tax-based tokenomics structure. The default reward is the native $TRFX token. Holders will utilize our revolutionary dashboard where they will be able to choose their reward from a selection of BEP20 tokens which will be automatically delivered to the holderâ€™s associated wallet address periodically. See the Whitepaper for additional information.","links":"https://www.triflextoken.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/triflex-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc0d52314f042f57112ed89b9401f5fc9b44ffd75"}}}
