{"name":"Cyberdoge","id":"cyberdoge-3","symbol":"cdoge","description":"CyberDoge (CDOGE) is an innovative, community-driven cryptocurrency built on the Solana blockchain. Combining the fun and excitement of the memecoin genre with powerful technological features, CDOGE leverages Solana's high-speed, low-cost infrastructure to create a fast, scalable, and energy-efficient digital asset. As the next evolution of the meme coin movement, CyberDoge seeks to offer much more than just a playful nod to Dogecoin and other memecoinsâ€”it aims to bring real utility, community engagement, and long-term value to its holders while using Solana as its \"rocket fuel\" to compete in the rapidly growing crypto space. CyberDoge stands out from other memecoins not only by offering a vibrant, fun-loving community but also by embracing the power of Solana's blockchain technology, allowing the token to offer faster transactions, lower fees, and greater scalability. This strategic use of Solana positions CyberDoge to compete with larger, more established players in the crypto ecosystem while providing a rewarding experience for token holders.","links":"https://cyberdogecoin.com/","market_cap":4215822,"market_cap_rank":2477,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cyberdoge-3/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"FXJAdx38aXJdQd3ABAVu7fQ7Bjh9oMN92eTxszFNpump"}}}
