GHOSTY revolutionizes the anonymization of cryptocurrency transactions through the innovative use of MTT (Monero Tunnel and Transfer) - a groundbreaking technology that offers a fundamentally new approach compared to traditional services. Unlike these, GHOSTY does not manage user funds, ensuring maximum security and privacy. In addition, GHOSTY not only enables anonymized currency exchanges, but also direct coin transfers between different blockchains without the need for decentralized smart contracts. Ghosty therefore does not act as a mixer. As an aggregator, Ghosty also analyzes the best prices for users in order to offer them the best exchange experience. Our decentralized and encrypted approach guarantees the anonymity of users, as identities and transactions are untraceable. Users always retain full control over their cryptocurrencies and can easily transfer them between blockchains. GHOSTY combines outstanding anonymization with ease of use to offer its users an unsurpassed level of security, best prices and maximum privacy.","links":"https://ghosty.cash","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ghosty/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ordinals":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"f33aa00681da52bda058a567b8e44511a455e92f09164998638a924de3f90acfi0"}}}
