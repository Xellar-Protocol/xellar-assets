{"name":"Liquid Hydra","id":"liquid-hydra","symbol":"lydra","description":"LYDRA (Liquid HYDRA) is the protocol-native liquid-staking token of HYDRA (the native coin of the Hydra Chain Blockchain). When a user stakes HYDRA, they immediately receive an equivalent amount of LYDRA—unlocking tradable liquidity while their underlying HYDRA remains locked and continues to earn staking rewards. LYDRA can be used across HydraChain’s DeFi ecosystem—trading, leveraged staking, hedged positions and more—without needing to unstake their original HYDRA coins.","links":"https://hydrachain.org/lydra","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/liquid-hydra/logo.png","detail_platform":{"hydra":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001013","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/hydra-chain/tokens/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001013"}}}
