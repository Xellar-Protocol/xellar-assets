{"name":"Tea-Fi","id":"tea-fi","symbol":"tea","description":"TeaFi started with a simple goal: to make DeFi accessible to the masses. However, we quickly realized that the current DeFi landscape wasn't intuitive enough for the average user. It lacked customization and often required technical expertise. To address these challenges, we've developed innovative features that make DeFi more user-friendly and accessible. For example: Private Mode: Conduct on-chain transactions without revealing your identity. Multi-Mode Swap: Choose from four different swap modes (Simple, Investor, Trading, and Custom) to tailor your experience to your needs. These are just a few examples of how TeaFi is revolutionizing the DeFi space.
