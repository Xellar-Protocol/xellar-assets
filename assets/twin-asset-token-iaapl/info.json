{"name":"TWIN ASSET TOKEN iAAPL","id":"twin-asset-token-iaapl","symbol":"iaapl","description":"TWIN Finance is a decentralized finance protocol for synthetic derivatives of real-world assets on blockchain. Its distinct long & short “twin-token” method enables the creation of synthetic assets that reflect the price of a real-world asset or crypto equivalent. This method offers high capital efficiency without requiring over-collateralization or exposure to the risk of liquidation. For liquidity providers, this twin-token approach substantially minimizes price risks, bringing them near to stable-coin levels.","links":"https://app.twinfinance.io","market_cap":20341,"market_cap_rank":9926,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/twin-asset-token-iaapl/logo.png","detail_platform":{"berachain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xcb700b56226d3b28a3b897c6ce8881bbfb22d2f8","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/berachain/tokens/0xcb700b56226d3b28a3b897c6ce8881bbfb22d2f8"}}}
