{"name":"Bitcomo","id":"bitcomo","symbol":"bm","description":"Bitcomo is a decentralized affiliate marketing network. The new paradigm provided by blockchain technology is ideal for online advertising, for it enables companies to better analyze the data collected from web users. This gives them the opportunity to precisely target audiences on a large scale at a much lower cost compared to traditional marketing tools. The Bitcomo affiliate marketing CPA network is wholly performance-based. This means that advertisers pay only when they see results and internet marketers are rewarded for each visitor or customer acquired through their own marketing efforts. This method incentivizes and rewards publishers and advertisers alike. Our goal is to create an affiliate marketing network which is completely impervious to ad fraud and payout problems. Bitcomo's business model is anchored by blockchain technology and the immutable proof and transparency this provides. This ensures the security of each user's data, whilst simplifying the interactions between them. Blockchain also eliminates unnecessary intermediaries between a company and its target audience. With less steps linking advertisers and their potential clients, companies can invest their advertising budget more wisely and profitably. Part of the next generation of CPA networks, Bitcomo is designed to help businesses reduce their advertising costs while increasing their impact. Not only do we know how to use blockchain t echnology to its full potential, but we have developed an infrastructure that will make the process as smooth as possible for businesses. BM Tokens can be spenton an advertising campaign or sold.","links":"https://bitcomo.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bitcomo/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":2,"contract_address":"0xe2fe5e7e206e7b46cad6a5146320e5b4b9a18e97"}}}
