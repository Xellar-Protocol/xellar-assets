{"name":"FairWitness","id":"fairwitness","symbol":"fwt","description":"The first on-chain zero-knowledge oracle dedicated to certifying the fairness of AI models. It accepts SHA-256 commitments of model weights and architectures, ingests anonymized inference logs, and produces zk-SNARK proofs to confirm that the model satisfies user-defined fairness thresholds—without revealing any private data. Upon successful verification, the agent mints a tamper-proof ERC-721 “Fairness Attestation NFT.” A lightweight verifier contract then exposes isModelFair(bytes32 modelHash) → bool, enabling downstream protocols to trustlessly query a model’s fairness status on-chain.","links":"https://fairwitness.online","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/fairwitness/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xdad49a24dac278c9721f082eee7cefa350070c1a","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xdad49a24dac278c9721f082eee7cefa350070c1a"}}}
