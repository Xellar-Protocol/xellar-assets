{"name":"P’Nut's Freedom Farm","id":"p-nut-s-freedom-farm_solana","symbol":"good","description":"The GOOD token is a Solana-based digital asset designed to directly support P'Nut's Freedom Farm, a non-profit animal sanctuary. This project aims to bridge the gap between cryptocurrency and real-world impact by creating a sustainable funding mechanism for the sanctuary's operations. P'Nut's Freedom Farm provides refuge and care for a variety of rescued animals. The GOOD token operates on the Solana blockchain, leveraging its speed and efficiency for transactions. Two distinct liquidity pools have been established on Raydium to facilitate trading and generate revenue for the sanctuary. The first pool, containing 400,000,000 GOOD tokens paired with 160 SOL, is permanently locked and burned, ensuring liquidity stability. This pool implements a 2% transaction tax that is automatically reinvested back into the pool, increasing liquidity over time. The second pool, also containing 400,000,000 GOOD tokens from the project's treasury, generates revenue through a 4% transaction tax on buys and sells. This tax revenue is directly allocated to support P'Nut's Freedom Farm's operational needs and capital projects. The project aims to demonstrate the potential of blockchain technology to drive positive change and support vital causes, such as animal welfare.","links":"https://www.pnutsfreedomfarm.com/","market_cap":31552,"market_cap_rank":8943,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/p-nut-s-freedom-farm_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"A6WCD9dzgpCpCofGG7boCN3jJitmBSoXS7tgZa4rGooD","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/A6WCD9dzgpCpCofGG7boCN3jJitmBSoXS7tgZa4rGooD"}},"is_native":false}
