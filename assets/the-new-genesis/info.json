Other players will receive items in this limbo randomly during their game. There are animated pets, a \"Merchant\" which allows you to purchase items from the limbo through an in-game earned currency, and community events such as the \"Mysterious Anomaly\" - an event in which the community decides how to approach an unknown obstacle, and based on the collective result the position of this mysterious entity with the community will be decided and written in the lore.","links":"https://www.thenewgenesis.xyz/","market_cap":8582.08,"market_cap_rank":11050,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/the-new-genesis/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"9S9fB8R5fhXN9jnXPNJtDXgfPjXBJhoAEMhJojP5pump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/9S9fB8R5fhXN9jnXPNJtDXgfPjXBJhoAEMhJojP5pump"}}}
