{"name":"MEMEME","id":"mememe","symbol":"$mememe","description":"What is the project about? $MEMEME is Memecoin/utility token for Me's (@mememe69696969) community on twitter. The token started out as something of a joke on twitter, but Me realized he could use it as an opportunity to build his community and an NFT ecosystem, as well as experiment with dao structures so he put together a small team to work with him. Up next we would like to launch an NFT collection and will likely use $MEMEME as the mint currency - similar to Radbros and $rad. Right now, however, the token does not have any use and is purely a utility coin for the future of the community.","links":"https://mememelabs.me/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mememe/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x1a963df363d01eebb2816b366d61c917f20e1ebe"}}}
