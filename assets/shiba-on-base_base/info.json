{"name":"SHIBA ON BASE","id":"shiba-on-base_base","symbol":"shib","description":"SHIB is bringing the Shiba Inu spirit of loyalty and fun to the Base ecosystem Schismatic Definition: A schismatic is someone who creates a schism. Schism: When there is a schism, a group or organization divides into two groups as a result of differences in thinking and beliefs. Applied to SHIB: Schismatic Shiba represents the evolutionary split from the original SHIB on ETH, boasting a proper auto deflationary contract with true decentralization. Layer one SHIB was taken over by a profit hungry, corrupt, and centralized team. SHIB on Base represents Ryoshi's vision without greed. Join the real revolution as it was intended. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is our key token, embodying a global, decentralized, community-driven currency. Launched on Base Chain, this evolved token is a global sensation, accepted at numerous places directly and bringing enhanced utility to the ecosystem.","links":"https://schismaticshiba.com/","market_cap":2572566,"market_cap_rank":2709,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/shiba-on-base_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xfca95aeb5bf44ae355806a5ad14659c940dc6bf7","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xfca95aeb5bf44ae355806a5ad14659c940dc6bf7"}},"is_native":false}
