{"name":"BigStrategy Inc","id":"bigstrategy-inc","symbol":"bstr","description":"BSTR is our stock and our core business is accumulating WLFI. Whenever our market cap grows by 5 million USD, we add more WLFI to the treasury. If it drops by 10%, we initiate buybacks and burns using our reserves. Our goal is simple and clear: keep accumulating, build a company that supports the USD1 ecosystem, and become the first in the world known for reserving WLFI.","links":"https://www.bigstrategy.inc/","market_cap":1999345,"market_cap_rank":3318,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bigstrategy-inc/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x85e92213fca84aa99adbac5049d8426984d64444","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x85e92213fca84aa99adbac5049d8426984d64444"}}}
