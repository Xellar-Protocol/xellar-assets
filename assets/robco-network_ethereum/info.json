{"name":"RobCo Network","id":"robco-network_ethereum","symbol":"robco","description":"RobCo Network is a decentralized robotics ecosystem built on Ethereum that transforms 3D printers and robots into income-generating Real World Assets (RWAs). By connecting devices through the RobCo DeviceKit hardware module and blockchain smart contracts, the network enables a global, on-chain marketplace for manufacturing. Operators can stake tokens and earn by completing verified jobs, while customers access a trustless system for ordering production with cryptographic quality assurance. The platform combines hardware integration, AI-driven quality control, and Ethereum-based payments to create a decentralized manufacturing economy.","links":"https://www.robco.network/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/robco-network/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x64ab897b7ad47dcb0d231fa9055b92b83ef75fe8","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x64ab897b7ad47dcb0d231fa9055b92b83ef75fe8"}},"is_native":false}
