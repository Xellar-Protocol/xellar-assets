{"name":"Grinbit","id":"grinbit","symbol":"grbt","description":"Grinbit project set out on its journey with a small goal that we will make our lives better through ‘untact communication’. Although the development of the Internet has already enabled us to have real-time communication without a face-to-face meeting, such a remarkable advancement has yet come short of perfection and we should not settle for the present. We live in a world where communication via cell phones is available anytime anywhere. However, more complex problems exist behind this development. There are some people who still suffer from low-quality service and functional restraints depending on one’s social class or background, and they are isolated from the innovation of technology. We, rooted in the ambition of leading an open communication with the best technology, have introduced and operated the video public phone in a number of places, such as military camps, correctional institutions, hospitals, nursing facilities or smart consultation in the Ministry of Justice. This experience has led us to contribute to the improved welfare and convenience for soldiers, by successfully providing the military camp with not only video call but also voice call and text message services.","links":"https://www.grinbit.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/grinbit/logo.png"}
