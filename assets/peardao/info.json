{"name":"PearDAO","id":"peardao","symbol":"pex","description":"What is Pear (PEX)? PEAR is a decentralized online marketplace. Our goal is to provide an open, free, decentralized marketplace that facilitates the exchange of goods and value using a decentralized payment system (cryptocurrencies), a decentralized marketplace (PEAR network) and a decentralized Moderator (PEAR DAO). How is PEX different Peardao (PEX) aims to complement the CEX and DEX-driven cryptocurrency ecosystem by enabling the exchange of value between on-chain, off-chain and cross-chain ecosystems, much like what we are seeing in centralized ecommerce marketplace like eBay and amazon. Transactions on the Pear marketplace are executed through smart contract(s), facilitated by encrypted chat tools. Credit history is public and transparent to all and arbitration is done through a decentralized dispute management system. Pear seeks to become the leading open marketplace. Our marketplace will eventually be compatible with any type of commerce transaction, payment method, and chain agnostic. We are a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) where members can make decisions to set rules for their ideal marketplace. PEXâ€™s vision is to become part of the infrastructure for the Web3 ecosystem.","links":"https://peardao.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/peardao/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6a0b66710567b6beb81a71f7e9466450a91a384b"}}}
