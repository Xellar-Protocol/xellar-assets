{"name":"Base Index","id":"base-index_base","symbol":"bindex","description":"$BINDEX is pioneering a new era of decentralized finance on the Base network — an actively managed, community-owned fund designed to give holders direct exposure to high-conviction plays, early launches, and Base-native opportunities without the need for constant research or trading. The philosophy is simple: you hold the token, the fund works for you. All profits, growth, and rewards are shared with the community of holders, with the ultimate goal of paying out 100% of the fund’s value multiple times over the life of the project.","links":"https://base-index.com/","market_cap":67661,"market_cap_rank":7699,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/base-index/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x92f344ee566459b5ba471b5a6003224c8a2d0415","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x92f344ee566459b5ba471b5a6003224c8a2d0415"}},"is_native":false}
