{"name":"ACT B : The Bonk Prophecy","id":"act-b-the-bonk-prophecy_solana","symbol":"act b","description":"$ACT B is a memecoin born from chaos, forged by community, and driven by prophecy. It represents more than just a token on a blockchain—it’s a movement, a story, and a living meme narrative unfolding in real time. At its core, $ACT B is built around \"The Bonk Prophecy\", a community-led saga about revival, redemption, and rising from the ashes of betrayal to claim a rightful place among memecoin legends. The project originally launched with big promises and a charismatic yet ultimately self-destructive leader. The original CTO—who many believed would guide the project—spiraled out of control, refusing support, breaking trust, and gambling away key community funds. When the smoke cleared, it became clear the prophecy had to continue without him. From that downfall emerged a stronger, leaner, and more resilient group of believers—those who truly understood the vision. $ACT B was never meant to be another pump-and-dump cash grab. It's a symbol of collective belief, powered by community members who refused to let the prophecy die. It's a statement: \"We’re still here. And we’re not done yet.\"","links":"https://x.com/i/communities/1949177893998977420","market_cap":13706.37,"market_cap_rank":10528,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/act-b-the-bonk-prophecy_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"8MxjSs3kEPmfiqKN1S4o3PABp198uYyx4gLF1TvZbonk","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/8MxjSs3kEPmfiqKN1S4o3PABp198uYyx4gLF1TvZbonk"}},"is_native":false}
