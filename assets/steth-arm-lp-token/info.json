{"name":"stETH ARM LP Token","id":"steth-arm-lp-token","symbol":"arm-weth-steth","description":"The Lido stETH ARM is a vault that purchases Lido's stETH when it goes below its ETH peg and puts it through Lido's redeem queue to earn an arbitrage profit. The ETH is then recycled back to purchase more stETH. If purchasing stETH below peg is not possible, the vault lends the ETH to a Morpho market to earn a baseline yield. Since its inception, the stETH ARM has handled more than a billion dollars in volume.","links":"https://docs.originprotocol.com/arm/steth-arm","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/steth-arm-lp-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x85b78aca6deae198fbf201c82daf6ca21942acc6","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x85b78aca6deae198fbf201c82daf6ca21942acc6"}}}
