Players will have access to a Netflix-like menu of game options separated into categories such as TV Game Shows, Kids, Classics, Trivia, Board, Adult and others. Every game will utilise its own specific gameplay mechanic to deliver an ‘engaging’ experience to players. Gamestar+® will launch with a dual token model: GSTAR - our blockchain-based governance token and GBUCKS - our in-game currency that can be used for a multitude of purposes, such as: ● In-app purchases ● Scoring Play to Earn and Play to Win ● Custom game skins ● NFTs to track achievements and customisation ● Level unlocks ● Premium content, and much more Gamestar+ intends to give content creators and stakeholders transparent access to know exactly how much their content has been used, and to be compensated fairly for it, and users to earn GBUCKS and NFTs by completing experiences, competing in events, earning achievements, or by buying NFTs directly from the Gamestar+ store using GBUCKS. With the first titles launching in Q1 2022, Gamestar+ is bringing the convenience of Netflix, the magic of Hollywood, and the social experience of game night to an industry ready for a revolution.","links":"https://www.blockchain.gamestarplus.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gamestarplus/logo.png"}
