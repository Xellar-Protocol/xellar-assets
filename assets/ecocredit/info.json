{"name":"EcoCREDIT","id":"ecocredit","symbol":"eco","description":"EcoCREDIT democratizes access to the voluntary carbon credit market by making it easy for individuals and businesses to access fractionalized carbon offsets. By warehousing, tokenizing, and standardizing voluntary carbon offsets for the first time, EcoCREDIT solves the current barriers to entry in the voluntary carbon offset market. This approach makes it possible for anyone to fight against climate change easily. Tokenized carbon offsets allow developers to easily call and amount of tokenized carbon offsets, thereby allowing for sustainable software applications. EcoCREDITâ€™s APIs allow businesses to offer carbon offsets to their customers at the point of sale, removing the current capital requirements to offer sustainable offsets to their clientele. EcoCREDIT makes living sustainably much easier in these ways. We also encourage high quality applications to share in the growing Eco brand in the form of franchised applicaitons. The first franchised application of EcoCREDIT, Ecolands, is a gamified, sustainable metaverse. Ecolands enables users to offset their carbon footprint in the form of NFTs which are backed by carbon offsets.","links":"https://ecocredit.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ecocredit/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x21fdb8e43d84420afbd6351d645f50c9138daae0"}}}
