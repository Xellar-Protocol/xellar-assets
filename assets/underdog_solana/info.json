{"name":"Underdog","id":"underdog_solana","symbol":"underdog","description":"Underdog is a community-driven project that emerged from a decentralized launch on the LetsBonk.fun platform. Following the initial release, the original token developer became inactive, resulting in a significant price decline. Despite this, the community has remained engaged and has since initiated the development of a trading and scanning platform designed to perform risk assessments on new token launches originating from the LetsBonk.fun ecosystem. The platform processes each new launch using a four-step analysis: Base Scan – Collects and reviews fundamental data, including image metadata and uniqueness of provided information. Off-Chain Scan – Verifies the existence and relevance of associated off-chain content such as websites and token references. On-Chain Scan – Evaluates the deployer’s wallet activity, funding sources, and historical behavior on the Solana network. Ongoing Monitoring – Continuously tracks key metrics such as token holder distribution, market capitalization, and trading volume to provide users with data-driven insights. The project aims to improve transparency and awareness within the LetsBonk.fun launch ecosystem by offering structured and automated risk evaluations.","links":"https://underdogstory.xyz","market_cap":5725.74,"market_cap_rank":12168,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/underdog_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"FAnDkc4jfztmgXdxJmGP4J9HpgHqv2fZLbnk5te2bonk","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/FAnDkc4jfztmgXdxJmGP4J9HpgHqv2fZLbnk5te2bonk"}},"is_native":false}
