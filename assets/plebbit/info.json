{"name":"Plebbit","id":"plebbit","symbol":"pleb","description":"What is the project about PLEB is the official token of Plebbit. It was created in January 2022 and originally ran on Avalanche Network, but after a Snapshot Proposal passed, the token was migrated to Ethereum. What makes your project unique? WHY DOES A DECENTRALIZED SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM NEED A TOKEN? The base protocol doesn't require tokens to function (which allows non-crypto holders to use it), but tokens can be used for any number of optional things: Utilize names.eth (ENS, which are NFTs) to represent a user/subplebbit name Use NFT images as User Avatars (only NFTs can be used as Avatars) Use any token or NFT of the subplebbit owner's choice as a way to vote, curate, reward, tip or incentivize Use any token or NFT of the subplebbit owners' choice as spam protection. Instead of using captchas, a subplebbit's could require users to own, stake, burn or pay a certain amount of the subplebbit's chosen token in order to post/upvote History of your project. SO IF ANY TOKEN CAN BE USED, WHY DOES PLEB EXIST? Holding PLEB will grant you membership to a DAO where you can vote on certain decisions, like grants, investments, curating whitelisted NFT collections and submitting PLEB proposals on https://snapshot.org/#/plebbit.eth/","links":"https://plebbit.com/home","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/plebbit/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xea81dab2e0ecbc6b5c4172de4c22b6ef6e55bd8f"}}}
