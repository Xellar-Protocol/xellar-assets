{"name":"Wrapped Berachain (Universal)","id":"wrapped-berachain-universal","symbol":"ubera","description":"uBERA is a wrapped implementation of BERA designed to enable trading and DeFi integrations across multiple blockchains. Berachain is a high-performance EVM-Identical Layer 1 blockchain utilizing Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL), and built on top of the modular EVM-focused consensus client framework BeaconKit. BERA is the native gas token of the Berachain network. BERA can be used to run a validator on Berachain and pay for gas fees on the network. Universal is a cross-chain asset protocol that enables users to trade and utilize wrapped assets (uAssets) across multiple blockchains. uAssets are 1:1 backed representations of native cryptocurrencies, such as XRP, DOGE, and SUI, held in secure custody. This allows users to access and transact with assets that are not natively available on their preferred chains, without relying on bridges or centralized exchanges. Universal provides seamless trading, liquidity provision, and lending opportunities for uAssets, ensuring deep liquidity and security through institutional-grade custody and real-time proof of reserves.","links":"https://docs.berachain.com/","market_cap":13122.9,"market_cap_rank":9278,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wrapped-berachain-universal/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x544f87a5aa41fcd725ef7c78a37cd9c1c4ba1650","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x544f87a5aa41fcd725ef7c78a37cd9c1c4ba1650"}}}
