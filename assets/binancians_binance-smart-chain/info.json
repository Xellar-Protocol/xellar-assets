{"name":"Binancians","id":"binancians_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"binancians","description":"In the vast and often turbulent sea of cryptocurrencies, many projects are born around technology, utility, or speculative promise. But Binancians is different. This token aims to be more than a digital asset — it is designed to embody the core values of Binance, giving community members a stake in, and a symbol of, the ethos that has driven one of the world’s largest crypto ecosystems. “Binancian” is a term originally coined to refer to individuals actively involved with or contributing to the Binance ecosystem — from employees and volunteers to users and supporters. These people are the lifeblood behind Binance’s mission, and their shared values define what it means to be a Binancian.","links":"https://binanciansbnb.com","market_cap":172242,"market_cap_rank":6143,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/binancians/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf197e06dab32b3c1cd8c055598bea0af11b44444","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xf197e06dab32b3c1cd8c055598bea0af11b44444"}},"is_native":false}
