{"name":"SUPERIOR","id":"superior","symbol":"superior","description":"$SUPERIOR is a Cardano-based meme token representing the next wave of utility and community in the ecosystem. While still under the radar, it’s designed to dominate narratives around DePIN, community-driven growth, and viral content on X. Here’s the breakdown: Built on Cardano: It uses ADA’s native token standard, requiring no smart contracts for basic transfers. That means it’s secure, cheap, and fast. Viral content engine: $SUPERIOR fuels an aggressive content strategy—memes, insights, analysis—laser-focused on growing the Cardano narrative. Community identity: It’s more than just a token. It’s a banner. A symbol for those who believe Cardano should lead the crypto conversation and that content is king. Tied to DePIN and engagement: It’s aligned with emerging trends like DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks), the rise of Midnight, and real-world Cardano adoption.","links":"https://adasuperior.com/","market_cap":1102927,"market_cap_rank":4013,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/superior/logo.png","detail_platform":{"cardano":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"a967738feca0f92afa0f781f2db4ec318ee6f06cb515fecf988fabfb0014df105355504552494f52","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/cardano/tokens/a967738feca0f92afa0f781f2db4ec318ee6f06cb515fecf988fabfb0014df105355504552494f52"}}}
