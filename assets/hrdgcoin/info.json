{"name":"HRDGCOIN","id":"hrdgcoin","symbol":"hrdg","description":"\"HRDG Blockchain is building the first technology platform for the energy supply chain. Using Blockchain technology in distribution ledgers and smart contracts, all stages of energy movement are uniquely tracked in a shared ledger to ensure transparency and lay the foundation for sustainable energy growth and energy security. HRDG Blockchain is currently expanding the market by entering the motorcycle oil market across Vietnam. We will make this technology platform available to other energy supply chains around the world in our public cloud software as a service (SaaS) applications. In addition to our SaaS offerings, we will provide application programming interface (API) access for developers who want to build their own apps for the platform. In addition, through the new payment method of the energy platform, we will diversify and broadly expand the ecosystem through global payment and remittance, a new post-pay travel business and global mining industry.\"","links":"https://hrdgsm.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/hrdgcoin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":12,"contract_address":"0xe9d0331ad47148925c5009d33a428ee301c9d534"}}}
