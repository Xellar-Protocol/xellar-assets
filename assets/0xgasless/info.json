{"name":"0xGasless","id":"0xgasless","symbol":"0xgas","description":"xGasless is a gasless ecosystem that seek to eliminate gas transaction completely. It's a novel solution to the gas fee problem, enabling users to conduct transactions on the Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible networks without incurring gas costs. The ecosystem will boast of the following applications: MEV free Gasless swap - These swaps leverage the concept of relayers or protocol wallets to facilitate trades between users. Relayers act as intermediaries, executing trades on behalf of users and absorbing the gas fees associated with the transactions. This approach allows users to interact with decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or execute smart contract operations seamlessly without worrying about gas fees. Gasless bridge - Its a technological solution that allows users to transfer assets or data between different blockchain networks without incurring gas fees. The approach here is known as \"meta-transactions.\" Meta-transactions involve a relayer or a trusted third party that pays the gas fees on behalf of the user. When a user wants to transfer assets across chains, they submit a transaction to the gasless bridge, which is then relayed to the target blockchain by the relayer. The relayer covers the gas fees required to execute the transaction, while the user only needs to pay the relayer's fee for their service. Nfts gasless minting - Gasless minting is made possible by utilizing off-chain technologies that enable the creation and storage of NFT metadata without directly interacting with the underlying blockchain. These solutions leverage techniques like batch minting, bundling transactions, or employing sidechains to reduce costs and congestion on EVM compatible networks. Gasless launchpad - This leverage smart contract functionalities and technologies like meta-transactions to facilitate feeless transactions. These mechanisms handle the gas fees on behalf of users, abstracting away the complexity and ensuring a seamless user experience. Overall, gasless launchpads on EVM compatible networks play a crucial role in driving the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies by removing barriers to entry, enhancing user experience, and democratizing access to token sales and investment opportunities. ZK anonymous swap - By leveraging ZK-SNARKs, anonymous swap protocols offer several advantages. First and foremost, they provide users with a high level of privacy and anonymity. Transactions executed through these protocols do not disclose the participants' identities, transaction amounts, or any other sensitive information. This enhanced privacy protection is particularly important in the context of decentralized finance, where preserving financial confidentiality is crucial.","links":"https://www.0xgasless.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/0xgasless/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x994a258c7dec633b5b15376f850d5ea701179e79"}}}
