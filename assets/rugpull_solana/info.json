{"name":"Brian","id":"rugpull_solana","symbol":"rugpull","description":"DEV Brian Donohue created $RUGPULL for fun, claiming that all memecoins are rugpulls. We will prove him wrong and accepts the challenge! CTO. RUGPULL's function serves as an example to the dozens of meme projects on the Solana blockchain of how an entire project can often fail due to the team's lack of competence, despite a large community and many technical possibilities. With its ticker, RUGPULL stands for the fact that people should not only look at the ticker to invest their money, but also at the strong will of the CTO team to create something great and to be controlled by the entire community.","links":"https://rugpullofsol.com","market_cap":7793.53,"market_cap_rank":11577,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/rugpull/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"HhVM9vHUxbAiRZ9chEecxhF6UdkzveaCG1NC1C3spump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/HhVM9vHUxbAiRZ9chEecxhF6UdkzveaCG1NC1C3spump"}},"is_native":false}
