{"name":"Leverage Protocol","id":"leverage-protocol","symbol":"levx","description":"Leverage Protocol is a decentralized perpetual exchange that allows traders to leverage trade up to 20x directly from their wallets. It uses zk-Snark technology and offers high liquidity on decentralized markets such as Uniswap, PancakeSwap, and SushiSwap. Leverage Protocol provides several unique features such as Margin Trading with Liquidity on DEXs, Risk Isolation Lending Pools, and Risk Calculation. The project aims to establish a completely permissionless decentralized margin trading infrastructure and create a decentralized crypto securities service that integrates with the global DeFi ecosystem. The platform has a total token supply of 618,000 with a maximum wallet holding of 4% of the total supply, and there is a 5% buy and sell tax on every transaction that is split between stakers and the marketing wallet. The staking rewards are distributed on a daily basis, providing a sustainable source of income for those who contribute to the platform's liquidity. Leverage Protocol's token (LEVX) can be used for staking, contributing to liquidity, and earning higher yields through depositing assets into lending pools, earning interest from borrowed assets, and receiving LEVX rewards. The project's vision is to provide a secure, efficient, and user-friendly platform for trading and lending in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.","links":"https://www.leverage-protocol.xyz","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/leverage-protocol/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x86f0cdb38a853420be4dbf6a3a9a3fe0756bc701"}}}
