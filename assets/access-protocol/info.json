{"name":"Access Protocol","id":"access-protocol","symbol":"acs","description":"Access Protocol is a digital platform designed to change how digital content is monetized, particularly benefiting creators by using a blockchain-based subscription model. Instead of traditional payment methods, Access Protocol utilizes its native token, ACS, to allow users to \"lock\" tokens in a creator's pool, granting them access to the creator's content. This model eliminates recurring subscription fees and is intended to provide a more straightforward and potentially more secure way for users to access and pay for content.","links":"https://www.accessprotocol.co/","market_cap":79919151,"market_cap_rank":538,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/access-protocol/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"5MAYDfq5yxtudAhtfyuMBuHZjgAbaS9tbEyEQYAhDS5y"}}}
