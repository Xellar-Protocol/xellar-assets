{"name":"Midas Hyperithm ETH","id":"midas-hyperithm-eth_ethereum","symbol":"mhypereth","description":"mHyperETH is a liquid yield token designed to track the performance of ETH-denominated, market-neutral yield strategies deployed across multiple on-chain ecosystems. The product allocates to strategies intended to generate risk-adjusted yield without taking directional exposure to the price of ETH. The strategy is monitored by Hyperithm, acting as the appointed Risk Manager and providing NAV updates. Midas conducts consistency reviews before publishing and propagating updated prices onchain. Yield is auto-compounded into the token price, which is updated on a weekly basis. mHyperETH is issued on Ethereum and is fully transferable. Standard redemptions are typically processed within an indicative window of up to seven business days, subject to the Risk Manager setting aside the corresponding funds. The product also supports instant redemptions, with a liquidity target of one to two percent of the circulating supply, generally replenished within two business days.","links":"https://midas.app/mhypereth","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/midas-hyperithm-eth_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x5a42864b14c0c8241ef5ab62dae975b163a2e0c1","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x5a42864b14c0c8241ef5ab62dae975b163a2e0c1"}},"is_native":false}
