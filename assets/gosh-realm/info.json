{"name":"GOSH Realm","id":"gosh-realm","symbol":"gosh","description":"GOSH Realm is the first decentralized stablecoin project with gamification design. The minting of the stablecoin is pledged by the community, the use of stablecoin is governed by the community, and the participation is simple, transparent and fair. In order to create a stablecoin system that is relatively volatility-resistant, value-backed, and highly utilized (by the broader ecosystem), the mechanics of algorithmic stablecoins are often quite complex, which creates a high barrier to community drive. Therefore, to address these challenges, GOSH Realm has incorporated gamification operations into the project design and user growth, reducing the cost of learning and adding depth to the experience, thus setting a new standard in the critical need for community-driven. At GOSH Realm, participating in the process of using algorithmic stablecoins will be easy and fun.","links":"https://www.gosh.fun/#/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gosh-realm/logo.png"}
