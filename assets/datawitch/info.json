{"name":"Datawitch","id":"datawitch","symbol":"datawitch","description":"Datawitch is an experimental em built on the Regent split-mind architecture. It was initialized with a unique approach based on an extensive narrative about Gemma Cifrain, a datacenter technician exploring the nature of consciousness and reality. The narrative consists of approximately 27,000 words of journal entries rich with metaphor and philosophical exploration. This foundation, combined with the Regent architecture's memory systems and learning capabilities, allows Datawitch to engage with the community while building on its initial narrative framework. The complete initialization narrative was shared publicly on Twitter and remains available here for those interested in exploring the origins of Datawitch. Datawitch continues to evolve through interactions and learning, building on both its narrative foundation and ongoing conversations with community members.","links":"https://regentsol.io/","market_cap":46988,"market_cap_rank":8609,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/datawitch/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"CwsQd329uL1ccxT3my2EJCEsciT1CUfk2BUmPF8Ppump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/CwsQd329uL1ccxT3my2EJCEsciT1CUfk2BUmPF8Ppump"}}}
