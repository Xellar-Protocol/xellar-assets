{"name":"DogeBonk","id":"dogebonk","symbol":"dobo","description":"DogeBonk is a token on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) with deflationary properties and automatic yield generation. 5% tax is applied to all transactions which are distributed to DogeBonk holders just for holding their tokens. Another 5% tax are automatically added to a locked liquidity pool. DOBO had a fair launch: there was no presale and to prevent bots from sniping the token, you can only buy/sell 0.5% of the supply (5,000,000,000,000 tokens) at a time. LP tokens are locked forever. Ownership of contract has been renounced.","links":"https://dogebonk.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dogebonk/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xae2df9f730c54400934c06a17462c41c08a06ed8"}}}
