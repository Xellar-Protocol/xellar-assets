{"name":"ClayStack Staked ETH","id":"claystack-staked-eth","symbol":"cseth","description":"ClayStack is a permissionless Ethereum liquid staking protocol that lets users stake their ETH and in return get the highly composable, csETH that can be used across DeFi. The ClayStack liquid staking protocol is the very first implementation of Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) on mainnet. This ensures that it remains highly decentralized, scalable, and fault-tolerant. This, in turn, reduces the susceptibility of penalties and slashing risks. When users stake their ETH with ClayStack, they receive csETH in return which is an ERC-20 token and can be used across DeFi.","links":"https://claystack.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/claystack-staked-eth/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x5d74468b69073f809d4fae90afec439e69bf6263"}}}
