{"name":"Enigma","id":"enigma-2_ethereum","symbol":"enx","description":"Enigma is a utility token designed to coordinate and secure a privacy-centric protocol stack built around encrypted communication, stealth-network routing, and decentralized identity primitives. It acts as the core mechanism for resource allocation, protocol governance, and access to control across encrypted services. $ENX supports token-gated privacy layers, and powers cryptographic verification workflows that minimize data exposure. Engineered for modular integration with modern Web3 infrastructure, Enigma delivers scalable, zero-knowledge-enhanced privacy for applications and users demanding high-assurance security.","links":"https://engma.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/enigma-2_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0511df77e420c9c37b065ddb7973d0f81430a092","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x0511df77e420c9c37b065ddb7973d0f81430a092"}},"is_native":false}
