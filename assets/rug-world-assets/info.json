{"name":"Rug World Assets","id":"rug-world-assets","symbol":"rwa","description":"Rug World Assets (RWA) is an innovative crypto project designed to revolutionize the way cultural and artistic assets are valued, traded, and secured on the blockchain. At the core of RWA lies the concept of tokenization, which allows for the fractional ownership of unique cultural artifacts, artworks, and collectibles. This opens up a new realm of possibilities for investors, art enthusiasts, and collectors alike, making previously inaccessible assets available to a broader audience. RWA's platform leverages cutting-edge blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and authenticity. Each asset on the platform is represented by a unique digital token, which corresponds to a share in the physical or digital asset. These tokens can be bought, sold, or traded on the RWA marketplace, providing liquidity and flexibility to asset holders. The project emphasizes the importance of community and cultural significance, aligning with the modern ethos of \"magic internet money of culture.\" By investing in RWA tokens, participants not only gain a stake in valuable cultural assets but also support the preservation and appreciation of global heritage.","links":"https://rugwa.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/rug-world-assets/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x928a6a9fc62b2c94baf2992a6fba4715f5bb0066"}}}
