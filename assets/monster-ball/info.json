{"name":"Monster Ball","id":"monster-ball","symbol":"mfb","description":"MonsterBall governance tokens: MFB token holders may participate in community governance and have voting rights for major game decisions. At the same time, MFB token holders may also get regular airdrops. Some key game operations need to consume MFB tokens, such as creating new monsters, upgrading monsters, forging equipment, etc. Our goal is to create a game world that combines Web 3.0 and traditional gaming models in which blockchain players and ordinary players can enjoy and immerse themselves in the Monsterball world. We are seeking to create a new generation of games that use conventional payment methods as well as owning and earning mechanisms on the blockchain, protect playersâ€™ rights and interests, and also have as little distance between developers and users as possible.","links":"https://monsterball.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/monster-ball/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa528d8b9cd90b06d373373c37f8f188e44cad3be"}}}
