In today’s business practices, the value of an asset is determined by several factors such as estimated risk, cost of operations, and determinants of growth. We believe this can be carried over into the crypto space as well. If we have the community support needed, we believe there is no limit to how far Shinuri can go in today’s market. We also feel the same about Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) which to most seem worthless, but because of the scarcity factor, hype and growing attention they are getting some series have become highly sought after with no ceiling to their potential value. The same mentality applies to meme coins. If enough people believe an asset’s value, the sky’s the limit.","links":"https://www.shinuri.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/shinuri/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x260d5f9688353af138d35ece6f0cd9c80ef982dd"}}}
