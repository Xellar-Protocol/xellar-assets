{"name":"NodeOps","id":"node-2_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"node","description":"NodeOps Network is a chain-agnostic, DePIN orchestration layer for general-purpose, economically-secured Compute. The ecosystem is underpinned by the $NODE token, which facilitates access to services, AVS-enforced slashing, incentivization, and governance across the NodeOps Network. NodeOps streamlines Node management and resource orchestration for blockchain and cloud applications, making decentralized Compute easy, reliable, and broadly accessible. NodeOps supports infrastructure across 60+ blockchain networks, has deployed over 60,000 nodes, created more than 20,000 NodeFolios, and manages approximately $150 million in assets under management (AUM). The platform serves over 130,000 monthly active users and has formed strategic partnerships with entities including Maven 11, Spartan Group, Hashed, Bitscale Capital, CARV, 0G Labs, and Avail. NodeOps Platform product suite includes: 1. Staking Hub: B2C gamified staking service offering dual incentives 2. Security Hub: B2B/B2C code vulnerability scanner providing instant, AI-powered, actionable reports 3. Compute Cloud: B2B permissionless DePIN Marketplace for verifiable generalized Compute 4. NaaS Console: B2C Node-as-a-service (NaaS) no-code Node runner dashboard with simplified Node management via NodeFolios 5. NodePad: B2B2C Blockchain and Protocol access to the Console ecosystem, enabling Node decentralization at speed and scale 6. Agent Terminal: B2B/B2C collaborative AI developer sandbox The product suite, powered by NodeOps Network, reflects a commitment to simplifying the builder experience so that users across verticals, from retail to enterprise, can focus on what matters to them. Further, the network centers on the NODE token, which functions as the primary medium for accessing platform services. Users burn NODE tokens to receive non-transferable credits that can be consumed across the NodeOps ecosystem, including node deployment, compute marketplace participation, and staking services. This burn-to-use mechanism creates utility demand tied to platform activity rather than speculative trading.","links":"https://nodeops.network/","market_cap":3259041,"market_cap_rank":2461,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/node-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x2f714d7b9a035d4ce24af8d9b6091c07e37f43fb","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x2f714d7b9a035d4ce24af8d9b6091c07e37f43fb"}},"is_native":false}
