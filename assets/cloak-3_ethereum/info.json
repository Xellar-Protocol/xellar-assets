{"name":"Cloak Network","id":"cloak-3_ethereum","symbol":"cloak","description":"HOW IT WORKS Our decentralized privacy ecosystem is built to give you full control over your digital footprint. Instead of relying on centralized services, we leverage a global, peer-powered network that supports secure browsing, private communication, anonymous data sharing, and censorship resistance. Whether you’re surfing the web, exchanging messages, or accessing content, your data is encrypted and routed through multiple independent nodes, making it virtually impossible to track, intercept, or manipulate. No single authority governs the system—it’s community-powered, open, and resilient by design.","links":"https://www.cloaknetwork.com","market_cap":139164,"market_cap_rank":6488,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cloak-3/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xde496a902836601e86e79d5b10e713c95580640b","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xde496a902836601e86e79d5b10e713c95580640b"}},"is_native":false}
