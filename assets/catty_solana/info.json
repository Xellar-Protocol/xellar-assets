{"name":"catty","id":"catty_solana","symbol":"catty","description":"Catty is a community-driven meme token launched on the Solana blockchain. The token originated as a spontaneous creation by a long-time Ethereum user exploring Solana through the Jupiter Mobile app and Jupiter Studio. Initially intended as a lighthearted experiment with token launch tools, Catty quickly attracted attention from the Solana community due to its humorous backstory and organic social media presence. The project embraces a playful, meme-focused culture while leveraging the speed, low fees, and accessibility of Solana’s ecosystem.","links":"https://x.com/i/communities/1955734715018916192","market_cap":58799,"market_cap_rank":7950,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/catty/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"Ag9TVNiyh2dDbVAzf1fZj6rjPLRTCLGXQzEDwWuZjupx","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/Ag9TVNiyh2dDbVAzf1fZj6rjPLRTCLGXQzEDwWuZjupx"}},"is_native":false}
