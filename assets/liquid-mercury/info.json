{"name":"Liquid Mercury","id":"liquid-mercury","symbol":"merc","description":"Liquid Mercury is a technology company led by Tony Saliba that delivers best-in-class institutional-grade trading infrastructure and workflow automation that meets the performance, security, and reporting standards of the most demanding traditional finance firms. The MERC is an ERC-20 utility token that can be used within the Liquid Mercury eco-system to create value for LM customers in 2 primary ways. 1. The MERC allows Liquid Mercury customers and non-customers to create discounts via the “Discount Farming Staking Program.” Discount Farmers (the MERC holder who stakes) produce monthly discounts called “Element Tokens” (ETs) based on the number of MERCs staked. ETs produced monthly by the Discount Farmer can be applied to your invoice if you are a customer or traded for Ethereum (ETH) in a private secondary exchange/market where Liquid Mercury customers and ET holders can meet to buy/sell ETs. 2. The MERC also gives access to exclusive research/content, curated trading tools, and trading rebates for individual users. The tokenomics of the MERC are such that as Liquid Mercury grows its invoiced revenue, the same number of MERCs will produce more and more ETs, creating a growing monthly ETH payments to the Discount Farmer/MERC Holder. Staked MERC holders also receive a “staking reward” in the form of 10% (annually) paid in MERCs.","links":"https://liquidmercury.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/liquid-mercury/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa203eb78fee91c8459c6d4ef3a899d8724ee5b35"}}}
