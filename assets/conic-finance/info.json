{"name":"Conic","id":"conic-finance","symbol":"cnc","description":"Conic Finance is an easy-to-use platform that enables liquidity providers to diversify their exposure to multiple Curve pools. Conic is facilitated by Omnipools that allocate liquidity to one asset across multiple Curve pools. The main purpose of Conic is to create efficient rebalancing of Curve liquidity. Where normally users have to manually shift funds between pools (while incurring high gas fees in the process), Conic automates this and enables the community to decide how liquidity should be allocated. The Conic governance token (CNC) can be used to vote on protocol parameters and can be earned by providing liquidity on the platform. Through governance, CNC holders can control pool weights and add new pools, control liquidity distribution on Curve Finance, and propose protocol changes.","links":"https://conic.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/conic-finance/logo.png"}
