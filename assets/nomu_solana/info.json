{"name":"Nomu","id":"nomu_solana","symbol":"nomu","description":"Nomu is a spend-to-earn marketplace on Solana where users buy products and earn when they sell. Participants receive rewards based on their activity (buying, trading, referring) associated with that product. Brands list items; users can back and transact in them. The model is “reflexive commerce”: marketplace transactions fund the rewards that are later distributed to the participants who contributed to those transactions. It functions as an on-chain launchpad for real-world goods.","links":"https://www.nomu.dev/","market_cap":4391557,"market_cap_rank":2184,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nomu/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"NomuBwKJEvJ8d4dsaq7NZoHaXWXzKcfke1c7Y8ruFYL","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/NomuBwKJEvJ8d4dsaq7NZoHaXWXzKcfke1c7Y8ruFYL"}},"is_native":false}
