{"name":"USDEX","id":"usdex-stablecoin","symbol":"usdex","description":"USDEX is an algorithmic stable coin with a built-in stability mechanism that aims to maintain USDEX’s peg to 1 USDC token. As part of a multi-token token system it is designed to be used as a medium of exchange within the Dex Money Market protocol. Dex Money Market is an algorithmic reserve protocol with multi step auto-compounded strategies and ETF rewards. Our protocol offers a single regulatory mechanism and protocol owned liquidity. The Money Market consists of three corresponding tokens – USDEX, dexSHARES and dexETF. Inspired by precursive projects before us (Tomb Finance, Olympus DAO, Balancer, Beefy Finance) we have developed a truly unique multi-token protocol that empowers users by simplifying the advanced trading strategies employed by experienced investors and promotes growth through a low-risk algorithmic trading model.","links":"https://www.dexfinance.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/usdex-stablecoin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x829c09fcc46d9fd31967272aba245bef9f727f93"}}}
