{"name":"Nyvo","id":"nyvo_solana","symbol":"nyvo","description":"Nyvo is a cutting-edge platform that allows anyone to create fully functional decentralized applications (dApps) using simple natural language prompts. In other words, users describe the app they want in plain English, and Nyvo’s AI-driven engine automatically generates both the on-chain smart contract backend and the web-based frontend, delivering a live blockchain application within minutes. This “prompt-to-dApp” approach dramatically lowers the barriers to Web3 development by removing the need to write code or navigate complex developer tools.The result is that developers, entrepreneurs, and even non-technical users can go from an idea to a deployed dApp faster and easier than ever before.","links":"https://www.nyvo.dev/","market_cap":4132.5,"market_cap_rank":12607,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nyvo_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"Gnth6Qhb9ChRGcE2bx2FJM4TSCk6KRMKF3U3AnFJbonk","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/Gnth6Qhb9ChRGcE2bx2FJM4TSCk6KRMKF3U3AnFJbonk"}},"is_native":false}
