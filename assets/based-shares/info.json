{"name":"BASED Shares","id":"based-shares","symbol":"bshare","description":"Based Finance a decentralized utility-based algorithmic token $BASED on the $FTM network pegged 1:1 with $TOMB via seigniorage. The protocolâ€™s underlying mechanism dynamically adjusts $BASED supply, pushing its price up or down relative to the price of $TOMB. Based Shares (BSHARE) are one of the ways to measure the value of the BASED Protocol and shareholder trust in its ability to maintain BASED close to peg. During epoch expansions the protocol mints BASED and distributes it proportionally to all BSHARE holders who have staked their tokens in the Acropolis (boardroom). BSHARE holders have voting rights (governance) on proposals to improve the protocol and future use cases within the Based finance ecosystem.","links":"https://basedfinance.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/based-shares/logo.png"}
