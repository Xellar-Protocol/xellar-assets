{"name":"RedSonic Vault Tether USD","id":"redsonic-vault-tether-usd","symbol":"rsvusdt","description":"RedSonic is an Ethereum zk Layer 2 solution released and maintained by Reddio. RedSonic Vault Tether USD (rsvUSDT) is a token that users receive when they deposit USDT, which replaces USDT for cross-chain operations to Layer 2. The USDT stored in RedSonic Vaults will be partially used for risk-free investments, and the generated returns will be proportionally distributed to all rsvUSDT holders. When users return from Layer 2, the exchange operation will be executed on Layer 1 Ethereum, burning rsvUSDT to retrieve the principal and all returns in USDT.","links":"https://www.reddio.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/redsonic-vault-tether-usd/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0x2e5d4e2a2336045471bfe446caa407f0c3a2419c"}}}
