{"name":"OS ARM LP Token","id":"os-arm-lp-token","symbol":"arm-ws-os","description":"The Origin OS ARM is a vault that purchases Origin's OS when it goes below its S peg and puts it through Origin's redeem queue to earn an arbitrage profit. The S is then recycled back to purchase more OS. If purchasing OS below peg is not possible, the vault lends the S to a Silo market to earn a baseline yield. Since its inception, the OS ARM has handled millions of dollars in volume. The OS ARM was modeled after the Lido stETH ARM.","links":"https://docs.originprotocol.com/os-arm","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/os-arm-lp-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"sonic":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x2f872623d1e1af5835b08b0e49aad2d81d649d30","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/sonic/tokens/0x2f872623d1e1af5835b08b0e49aad2d81d649d30"}}}
