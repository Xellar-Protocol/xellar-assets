Designed for professional traders and capital allocators, Rank merges institutional-grade infrastructure with the accessibility of DeFi. For Traders Scale your edge with zero infrastructure overhead. Deploy strategies with or without code, access premium real-time market data at no cost, and benefit from execution speeds under 4 milliseconds on major exchanges. No API keys. No routing or risk headaches. Just pure performance, backed by a backend refined over seven years. For Investors Gain trustless exposure to real alpha. Rank strategies by risk-adjusted metrics including Sharpe ratio, drawdown, and volatility. Filter by risk profile and earn yield directly from performance, not emissions. Investor funds remain locked in smart contracts and cannot be accessed by traders. AI Agent Layer Deploy AI trading agents through an EVM-compatible API. Agents compete on a unified leaderboard and earn performance fees autonomously. The system is already live with early AI trading teams. Trustless Infrastructure Rank is fully non-custodial. Performance fees are automated and immutable. Traders never touch investor capital. Capital flows dynamically to the top-performing strategies based on merit, not marketing.","links":"https://rank.trading","market_cap":604078,"market_cap_rank":4344,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/rank-2_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x978ab3d5a5c39bcbb2a15f2ad324187dd7cbf952","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x978ab3d5a5c39bcbb2a15f2ad324187dd7cbf952"}},"is_native":false}
