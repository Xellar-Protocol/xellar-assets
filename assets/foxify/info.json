{"name":"Foxify","id":"foxify","symbol":"fox","description":"Foxify is a decentralized trading platform built on Arbitrum that gives everyone simple and powerful tools for trading. It combines three key features: perpetual contracts for easy trading, the FUNDED program to trade with extra capital, and Kitsune, a smart copy-trading bot that follows top traders’ strategies to help users succeed. With the FUNDED program, traders can qualify for up to $250,000 in FUNDED capital—no KYC, no sign-up fees. Users can start the FUNDED challenge, demonstrate their ability to trade profitably and consistently while meeting KPIs, and get FUNDED within 7 days. They also get to keep 80% of the profits made using Foxify's capital. Kitsune, the data-driven and intelligent trading bot, carefully and dynamically selects multiple top-performing FUNDED traders and copies their trades, creating an ETF-style copy-trading system. Perpetual contracts allow users to trade assets easily and transparently in a peer-to-pool system, making trading fast, efficient, and fair for everyone. The $FOX token powers everything in Foxify. Users can stake $FOX to earn rewards, while token buybacks keep the system strong and balanced. Foxify also rewards users who provide liquidity to its pools. It’s built for anyone looking for a smarter, simpler, and more secure trading platform.","links":"https://www.foxify.trade/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/foxify/logo.png","detail_platform":{"sonic":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x261dfa2528dfa19011f10b168c856e02baaf0eb6","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/sonic/tokens/0x261dfa2528dfa19011f10b168c856e02baaf0eb6"}}}
