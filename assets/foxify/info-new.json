Foxify allows traders to engage in high-leverage trades, up to 50x, and provides a unique feature where users can set their own trading terms. Additionally, Foxify introduces a staking mechanism where participants can earn a portion of the platform's trading fees. The platform also promotes liquidity by enabling users to invest in both Blue Chips and Stablecoins. Ensuring complete decentralization, Foxify's options trading does not rely on intermediaries, and its advanced technology supports the trading of a diverse range of asset pairs.","links":"https://www.foxify.trade/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/foxify/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6bcc14b02cd624ebe1a8a665cb6d4067aa097230"}}}
