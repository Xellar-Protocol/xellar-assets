Users can stake their METIS token on Artemis Finance and receive the liquid token - artMETIS.Artemis offers METIS holders a streamlined opportunity to participate in the Decentralized Sequencer and earn profits. Simultaneously, participating users will receive a liquid wrapper called artMETIS, which automatically accumulates earnings. This single-wrapper mechanism provides a simpler and more unified user experience, eliminating the need for additional costs to incentivize liquidity across multiple wrappers. This approach makes it easier to build a robust DeFi usage scenario.","links":"https://artemisfinance.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/staked-metis-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"metis-andromeda":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x2583a2538272f31e9a15dd12a432b8c96ab4821d"}}}
