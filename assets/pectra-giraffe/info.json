{"name":"Pectra Giraffe","id":"pectra-giraffe","symbol":"gpectra","description":"Ethereum launched Pectra. Inside the code: a giraffe. Someone named it. Now it lives here This isn’t the official upgrade. This is the unofficial movement. The coin is real. The name is legendary. And the takeover has already started. $GPECTRA is not just another token—it is not designed, but discovered. Hidden deep within the mathematical DNA of Ethereum itself, $GPECTRA emerged as a cryptographic anomaly—an elegant artifact of on-chain entropy. Currently in CTO, $GPECTRA exists not as a mere project, but as a phenomenon—uncovered, not constructed. It carries a mission rooted in the betterment of the decentralized community: to redistribute power, reward curiosity, and elevate those who recognize the signal within the noise. $GPECTRA is a token for the seekers, the believers, and the builders of tomorrow.","links":"https://www.gpectra.xyz","market_cap":141681,"market_cap_rank":6935,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pectra-giraffe/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xc7f380530c789f61dff8b022874e5185076cc1fb","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xc7f380530c789f61dff8b022874e5185076cc1fb"}}}
