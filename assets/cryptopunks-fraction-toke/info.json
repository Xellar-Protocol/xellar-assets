To solve this problem, Gate.io creatively proposed a solution with NFT Fraction Token. The top NFT anchored in this issue is: CryptoPunks The CryptoPunks are 24x24 pixel art images, generated algorithmically. Most are punky-looking guys and girls, but there are a few rarer types mixed in: Apes, Zombies and even the odd Alien. The Cryptopunks are one of the earliest examples of a \"Non-Fungible Token\" on Ethereum, and were inspiration for the ERC-721 standard that powers most digital art and collectibles.","links":"https://www.gate.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cryptopunks-fraction-toke/logo.png"}
