{"name":"ShineMine","id":"shinemine","symbol":"shine","description":"The New Way to Mine What is ShineMine? ShineMine is tokenized cryptomining, deploying real world hardware to generate rewards. Those rewards are claimed by SHINE token holders every week. How is SHINE different? SHINE is powered by real assets using proven cryptomining strategies, giving real utility and value to SHINE tokens. ShineMineâ€™s code is open source, allowing anyone to see how tokens are allocated and how the smart contracts are written How does SHINE work? Taking a decentralized approach gives the benefit of mining at a large scale to investors of any size, on any time frame. SHINE is hard coded for responsible, continued growth. A portion of the rewards are continually reinvested, increasing the total reward pool, while simultaneously distributing weekly rewards paid in BNB to SHINE token holders.","links":"https://www.shinemine.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/shinemine/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xbb78cd9d658201119a78395de350e3f531c12273"}}}
