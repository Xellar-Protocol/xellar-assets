With Preprints.io, research is stored as NFTs (ERC721 tokens) on the Polygon blockchain, ensuring they are immutably recorded. Authors can freely decide their manuscript's accessibility: offering open access or monetizing through ERC20 access tokens facilitated by the Ocean Protocol.","links":"https://preprints.io","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/preprints-io/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x1d3c629ca5c1d0ab3bdf74600e81b4145615df8e"}}}
