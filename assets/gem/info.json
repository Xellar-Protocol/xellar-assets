{"name":"GEM","id":"gem","symbol":"gem","description":"The GEM Protocol seeks to resolve the fundamental inefficiencies inherent in conventional point and loyalty systems by introducing a next-generation standard: GEM (Global E-Money). By enabling the seamless conversion of fragmented, corporate-issued points into GEM—a highly liquid and stable digital asset—GEM empowers users with actual purchasing power in both online and offline environments. This transformation is more than just technical; it redefines how value is stored, transferred, and utilized in the digital economy. GEM functions as a flatcoin, maintaining consistent value through its underlying asset mechanisms, and can be used globally as a reliable medium of exchange. By bridging digital and real-world economies, the GEM Protocol is building a truly borderless payment network that delivers utility, trust, and accessibility to individuals and businesses alike, regardless of geography.","links":"https://globalemoney.io","market_cap":40465,"market_cap_rank":8846,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gem/logo.png","detail_platform":{"aptos":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0x3fb7291a814eea979045f0bdb6b128a2a4f59533edad9d792069221586b92ab5::GEM::GEM","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/aptos/tokens/0x3fb7291a814eea979045f0bdb6b128a2a4f59533edad9d792069221586b92ab5::GEM::GEM"}}}
