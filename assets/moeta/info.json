{"name":"Moeta","id":"moeta","symbol":"moeta","description":"Generally, tokens are burned to either increase the value of a crypto asset by reducing the supply or to create publicity and visibility for a token. Both of these are considered “bullish” by investors and being able to invest during a major token burn could see the value of that investment appreciate considerably. Among the tens of thousands of tokens that are running across chains, the only way to keep a track of all burns – major or minor – is to do it manually, by keeping track of tokens across various social media, which can be difficult for even the sharpest of investors. Moeta developed a set of utilities and features designed around burns, making it easier for investors to keep track of burns and stay on top of the market and make calculated investment decisions.","links":"https://moetatoken.com","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/moeta/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x238a1fcc2f65ed50c1e1797cf5857cba3e82a55b"}}}
