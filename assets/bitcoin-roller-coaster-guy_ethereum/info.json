{"name":"Bitcoin Roller Coaster Guy","id":"bitcoin-roller-coaster-guy_ethereum","symbol":"brcg","description":"Bitcoin Roller Coaster Guy ($BRCG) is a meme token on the Ethereum blockchain inspired by one of the first visual memes in cryptocurrency culture. Created in 2013, the \"Roller Coaster Guy\" animation became a widely recognized symbol of Bitcoin’s price volatility. The $BRCG token aims to preserve this cultural artifact by bringing it on-chain through a community-owned ERC-20 token. The token has no taxes, renounced ownership, and permanently burned liquidity.","links":"https://btccoaster.com/","market_cap":8377.76,"market_cap_rank":11522,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bitcoin-roller-coaster-guy_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xd4c4407f3afb48d7d4ad954572f155f9237ae335","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xd4c4407f3afb48d7d4ad954572f155f9237ae335"}},"is_native":false}
