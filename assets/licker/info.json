{"name":"Licker","id":"licker","symbol":"licker","description":"Meet LICKER, the quintessential embodiment of everything gone wrong in the world of crypto. Born out of the darkest corners of the shitcoin universe, LICKER is a grotesque parody of financial innovation, fueled by reckless speculation and blind greed. Its appearance is a chaotic mess of garish colors and garbled text, reflecting the incoherence of its purpose and value. LICKER's origins are shrouded in controversy, rumored to have been created by a group of anonymous developers with a penchant for chaos and a disregard for ethical standards. It promises the moon to unsuspecting investors with flashy, over-the-top marketing campaigns that seem to be more about luring in the gullible than delivering any real utility. The tokenomics of LICKER are as absurd as its name. Its supply is infinite, its utility is vague, and its roadmap is a jumble of buzzwords with no clear direction. Despite its disreputable nature, LICKER attracts a certain type of investor—those who chase after the next big “hit” in the crypto space without a second thought for long-term stability or ethical considerations.","links":"https://licker.wtf/","market_cap":43352,"market_cap_rank":5341,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/licker/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x1b3be8fcd2e7c5ce9c5c242e0066fdd9740220d0"}}}
