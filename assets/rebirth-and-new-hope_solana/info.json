{"name":"Rebirth and New Hope","id":"rebirth-and-new-hope_solana","symbol":"rebirth","description":"Rebirth and New Hope (Rebirth) is a community driven meme token on Solana. The project was originally created and named Rebirth by its initial developer. After the developer stepped away, the project went through an early market collapse. The token itself remained unchanged. Instead of abandoning it, community members stayed, rebuilt the social presence, and continued the project through open, community led efforts. Rebirth represents continuity rather than replacement — a project carried forward rather than restarted. Today, Rebirth is maintained by contributors coordinating communication, branding, and ongoing operations through open participation. Its long term goal is to exist as a cultural symbol within the Solana ecosystem, reflecting shared experience, resilience, and collective continuity rather than financial utility.","links":"https://www.rebirth-official.com/","market_cap":10844.34,"market_cap_rank":11013,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/rebirth-and-new-hope_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"8mgM8w9BDeZvL1pm86xPDvPw9XHL3vwXkFBqU693pump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/8mgM8w9BDeZvL1pm86xPDvPw9XHL3vwXkFBqU693pump"}},"is_native":false}
