{"name":"Agent4X","id":"agent4x_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"agent4x","description":"Agent4X is a developer-focused toolkit and runtime for building autonomous trading and data-gathering agents that operate across centralized exchanges, DEXs, and prediction markets. The project provides SDKs, a job scheduler, and opinionated reference agents for tasks like market-making, execution, monitoring, and alerting. It emphasizes non-custodial operation, clear auditability, and modular components (strategy, risk, transport). Agent4X also offers optional UX surfaces (CLI, Telegram, and web dashboards) designed for small teams to run agents reliably without bespoke infra.","links":"https://agent4x.space","market_cap":3864.27,"market_cap_rank":12708,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/agent4x/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x84698879ba7679da4f175bf1ed90afcacd074444","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x84698879ba7679da4f175bf1ed90afcacd074444"}},"is_native":false}
