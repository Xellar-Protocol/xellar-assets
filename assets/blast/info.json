{"name":"Blast","id":"blast","symbol":"blast","description":"Blast is the only Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) with native yield for ETH and stablecoins. Blast's yield comes from ETH staking and Real-World Asset (RWA) protocols, automatically passing the yield back to users. While other L2s have a default interest rate of 0%, Blast offers 3.4% yield for ETH and 8% for stablecoins. Blast is unique in providing builders with new building blocks: native yield and gas revenue sharing. Dapps can use these to build more competitive products and business models than on any other chain.","links":"https://blast.io/","market_cap":233810020,"market_cap_rank":349,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/blast/logo.png","detail_platform":{"blast":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb1a5700fa2358173fe465e6ea4ff52e36e88e2ad"}}}
