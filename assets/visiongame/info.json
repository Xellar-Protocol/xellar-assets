{"name":"VisionGame","id":"visiongame","symbol":"vision","description":"The potential growth of the blockchain gaming market is still, for us at VisionGame, mostly untapped. While a lot of strives have been made to design and implement ground-breaking innovations like play2earn mechanics, not the same can be said for the production value of many of the products released when compared to the traditional gaming market. That, and a strong trust that blockchain gamers would go through any hurdle to participate in a game offering possible remuneration, have made so far for a market that has a strong internal growth and support, but several difficulties to attract external audiences. VisionGame aims to shape the games of the future, towards healthier approaches and higher quality productions. No matter the platform or the market, gamers love great games, and weâ€™re putting at the service of the industry our decades of experience designing games and tools for developers. We do that through a series of products, from our VisionSDK to support developers in their technical journey, to VisionOffering which helps them connect with their audience and gather support. Other products, like VisionWallet and VisionCommunity allow for a more approachable onboarding process, lowering the cost of entry and allowing gamers to enjoy their games without worries. Just like a publisher though, we offer consolidated design and technical expertise to the projects that seek our services, raising the bar for the industry one game at a time.","links":"https://visiongame.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/visiongame/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x332e78c687c3fcd91494c6b13f0fc685b2a57434"}}}
