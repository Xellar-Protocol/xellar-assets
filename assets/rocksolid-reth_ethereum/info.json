{"name":"RockSolid rETH","id":"rocksolid-reth_ethereum","symbol":"rock.reth","description":"RockSolid is a vault platform (think similar to Veda, Concrete, etc). We make it easy for protocols to whitelist vaults into their front-end. The first integration is Rocket Pool (rETH). See the integration into their app here: https://stake.rocketpool.net/rocksolid/vault/deposit RockSolid unlocks opportunities once reserved for whales and private networks. Our mission is to democratize access to these strategies, giving everyone the chance to benefit from the same high-value opportunities that were previously out of reach.","links":"https://rocksolid.network/","market_cap":6509896,"market_cap_rank":1867,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/rocksolid-reth/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x936facdf10c8c36294e7b9d28345255539d81bc7","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x936facdf10c8c36294e7b9d28345255539d81bc7"}},"is_native":false}
