{"name":"DaVinci","id":"davinci","symbol":"wtf","description":"DaVinci is a revolutionary web3 collaborative generative AI art experiment comprised of 8,888 liquidity-backed NFT artworks, created by the community of holders in collaboration with AI. Designed by the innovators of the first liquidity-backed NFTs, the project leverages the novel ERC-404 Protocol, facilitating direct token-NFT pairing for immediate trading on decentralized platforms. Ownership is simplified: hold at least one complete token to claim your NFT; less than one, and the NFT is burned, enhancing scarcity. This project is more than art—it’s a historical ledger of digital creation, inviting you to be a part of its unfolding story.","links":"https://davinci.wtf/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/davinci/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x730bcbe5cdc1a3061dfe700774b7b8dd1d4173db"}}}
