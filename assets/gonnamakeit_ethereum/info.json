{"name":"GonnaMakeIt","id":"gonnamakeit_ethereum","symbol":"gmi","description":"GonnaMakeIt (GMI) is an NFT marketplace and DeFi platform that focuses on secure trading and durable liquidity. The marketplace supports on-chain royalty protection and refundable minting options to reduce common risks for creators and collectors. Its core DeFi feature is LP-Bond NFTs, which represent liquidity positions locked for multi-year terms while remaining tradable as NFTs. This design aims to improve liquidity quality for partner projects without removing flexibility for participants. GMI complements these features with a multi-program airdrop and tiered referrals to encourage usage. The GMI token is an ERC-20 on Ethereum and is used across marketplace incentives and protocol governance.","links":"https://www.gonnamakeit.com","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gonnamakeit_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x044e874f23f9a7e5dad696554a116c4bb62fecb7","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x044e874f23f9a7e5dad696554a116c4bb62fecb7"}},"is_native":false}
