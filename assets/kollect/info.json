{"name":"Kollect","id":"kollect","symbol":"kol","description":"$KOL is a vital part of the whole Kollect ecosystem. Users can purchase NFT card packs and synthesize them on Kollect using KOL tokens, and the rewards of yield-bearing staked NFTs will also be in $KOL. $KOL holders will also enjoy a range of perks on Kollect, such as priority access to new issue NFTs and governance rights. We look forward to meeting all the Kollectors on Kollect. Kollect is a gamified collection card platform for any branded IPs. Its Collection Book system Kollect.book has a unique built-in play-to-earn feature, allowing users to strategically stake their cards in different collection books to maximize their rewards. Kollect.book enables flexible gamification of collecting activities. The games published by Kollect through Kollect.game are where users can put their collected NFT cards into real actions. Each of the branded IPs can have their own games and in-game currency. The first game in the Kollect ecosystem will be a play-to-earn battle card game with PvP and PvE combat modes. Kollect envisions becoming the hub for NFT collectibles and play-to-earn games.","links":"https://kollect.cards/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kollect/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x1cc30e2eac975416060ec6fe682041408420d414"}}}
