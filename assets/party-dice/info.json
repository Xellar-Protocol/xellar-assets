{"name":"Party Dice","id":"party-dice","symbol":"dice","description":"Party Dice (DICE) is an ERC20 token on the Arbitrum layer-2 Ethereum solution that facilitates decentralized staking and wagering. Any user may permissionlessly wager DICE against the contract using VRF and completely on-chain systems. DICE is the protocol token to RISKY.LOL - a decentralized platform that allows for permissionless creation and use of pools for any ERC20 tokens reasonably within the standard. Token stakers receive a liquidity-token in exchange for their stake, and it is representative of a share of the pool. DICE holders and pool stakers both are entitled to various potential gains from all players interacting with the house pools. Game contracts and reward systems are modular, which allows for expansion and regular new additions.","links":"https://risky.lol","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/party-dice/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x3789be915951e0f0a676588c99e7357d3fdb586b"}}}
