{"name":"Solana Money Glitch","id":"solana-money-glitch_solana","symbol":"smg","description":"Solana Money Glitch (SMG) is a deflationary reward token built on the Solana blockchain, designed to provide passive income to its holders through a unique reward mechanism. Every 5 minutes, SMG holders automatically receive Solana rewards directly into their wallets, simply for holding the token. This is enabled by a 5% transaction tax, split into two parts: one portion is redistributed to holders as Solana rewards, and the other is used to burn tokens, reducing the total supply over time. SMG launched with a fair distribution model: 100% of the token supply was added to liquidity at launch, with no team tokens, no pre-sale, and no wallet limits, ensuring equal access for all participants. Built on Solana, it benefits from fast, low-cost transactions. SMG aims to offer a straightforward tokenomics model that rewards holding and supports the Solana ecosystem. Its passive rewards and deflationary design make it an appealing option in Solana’s DeFi space.","links":"https://www.solanamoney.com/","market_cap":7757.6,"market_cap_rank":11650,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/solana-money-glitch_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"B9r1YcdKPg6AmTb4RaFJtucjocozVKJ3gpAcRp7PQ6kE","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/B9r1YcdKPg6AmTb4RaFJtucjocozVKJ3gpAcRp7PQ6kE"}},"is_native":false}
