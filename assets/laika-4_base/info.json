{"name":"Laïka","id":"laika-4_base","symbol":"laïka","description":"Laika was a Soviet stray dog, a mixed-breed between a husky and a terrier, who became the first living creature to orbit the Earth. She was launched aboard the Sputnik 2 spacecraft on November 3, 1957, during the height of the Cold War and the space race. Chosen for her small size, calm temperament, and ability to endure harsh conditions, Laika became a symbol of both scientific progress and sacrifice. Sadly, the mission was one-way, and Laika died a few hours after launch, likely due to overheating. Her story left a lasting impact on the world and sparked ethical debates about the use of animals in scientific research.","links":"https://ape.store/base/0x05a5b4e217004eb84c6787e0ecbe7a46cfd94cdd","market_cap":16067.64,"market_cap_rank":10206,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/laika-4/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x05a5b4e217004eb84c6787e0ecbe7a46cfd94cdd","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x05a5b4e217004eb84c6787e0ecbe7a46cfd94cdd"}},"is_native":false}
