{"name":"Tuition Coin","id":"tuition-coin","symbol":"tuit","description":"TUIT is used to provide micro rewards and sponsorships to children on EdTech platforms. By offering rewards for academic achievements, TUIT motivates users, whether students, parents, or guardians, to take a more active role in the learning process. TUIT aims to support children in saving for future education expenses and college tuition. To achieve this, users of all our EdTech partners are required to vest until the children reach 18 years of age. This extended vesting period ensures the stability of the entire ecosystem.","links":"https://tuitioncoin.org","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/tuition-coin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x963cd3e835d81ce8e4ae4836e654336dab4298e9","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x963cd3e835d81ce8e4ae4836e654336dab4298e9"}}}
