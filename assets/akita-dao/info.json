{"name":"Akita DAO","id":"akita-dao","symbol":"hachi","description":"The ERC-20 governance token HACHI is the governance token utilized by the holders of the digital currency AKITA, also known as Akita Inu. HACHI allows holders to represent their voice in the Akita DAO, a distributed-leadership community focused on building a long-term ecosystem for its members. The Akita DAO will use its current funding stream from Gitcoin (through Q1 2027) and any future revenue streams to support the development and growth of the ecosystem. By connecting to Snapshot, HACHI holders can vote on proposals that will steer this ecosystem development process. HACHI will also be utilized in the future to buy AKITA. With Gitcoinâ€™s funding stream operational through March 2027, the Akita DAO has a tremendous potential to create a lasting impact on the blockchain financial sector. If you would like to contribute or learn more about the Akita DAO, please join our Discourse (coming soon!) and Snapshot communities. The AKITA token Telegram channel is also available for community discussion and networking. On February 1, 2021, the AKITA token was launched on the Ethereum network. One of the original \"meme coins\" to follow DOGE and then SHIB, Akita Inu was launched with a maximum supply of 100 Trillion (100,000,000,000,000) AKITA tokens. AKITA is so OG that there are no taxes or fees incurred during transfers, sells, or buys. As a \"social experiment\" or marketing gimmick, they also sent 50% of the supply to Vitalik Buterin's wallet, attempting to call these tokens \"effectively burned.\"","links":"https://akita.network","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/akita-dao/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x967b0c95295ead8faef70d26a7846aecd349aaff"}}}
