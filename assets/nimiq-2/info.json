Nimiq is the only blockchain where users always participate directly by default. In comparison to the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum where the default is to use a third-party node to connect to the network.

Atomic swaps between crypto like NIM and BTC (ETH coming soon) and fiat currencies like EUR (USD next) with no personal information are now possible. Earned swap fees are converted to NIM and held to create scarcity. See how it works: https://nim.link/3w7 Nimiq created Albatross, a new, super fast Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm that will launch in 2021 with Nimiq 2.0, the next version of the Nimiq Blockchain. We expect ~1000 TPS and finality in one second, pushing Nimiq 2.0 to the theoretical limits of single chain blockchain protocols. Energy consumption will also be reduced to less than 1% (compared to current Nimiq POW) with this upgrade. Try out the demo: https://nim.link/rub Nimiq’s “super-halving” coming soon! The transition to Nimiq 2.0 will reduce the emission rate from currently ~3000 NIM to only ~525 NIM per minute.
