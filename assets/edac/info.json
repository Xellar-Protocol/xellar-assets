{"name":"EDAC","id":"edac","symbol":"edac","description":"\"# What is EDAC? EDAC is the tokenization of mining power, in the Binance Smart Chain and in the Ethereum Blockchain (ERC20 token). Token holders can contribute to the process of securing PoW blockchain networks while benefiting from the block rewards indirectly with EDAC. ## How it works? The process is as follows: EDAC tokens are sold and used to buy hashrate power, i.e. through rigs. This power generates mining rewards. The net income (around 50% of all ETH rewards) is used to buyback EDAC coins, which will immediately be burnt. This constant demand and decreasing supply should impulse EDAC price to new All-Time Highs. When an ATH is reached (not before), up to a 0.5% of token supply can be sold to buy new mining capacity, conforming a virtuous circle of returns.\"","links":"https://edac.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/edac/logo.png"}
