{"name":"Kroma","id":"kroma","symbol":"kro","description":"What is the project about? Kroma is a Layer 2 solution on top of Ethereum, where Kroma -is the only universal Layer 2 in Asia that plans to onboard 100+ games backed by WEMADE -runs with Optimistic Rollup with zkEVM implemented and plans to switch to full zkEVM next year -will be issuing our own native token and grant programs will be updated soon What makes your project unique? We combined both Optimistic rollup and ZK rollup with ZK fault proofs, using ZK trie so further down the road we can migrate completely to ZK rollup. Kroma is a game-centric layer 2 targeting the Asia market. History of your project. Started off with a wallet focused company, but Wemade, a Korean stock market listed firm acquired our firm and changed to a completely different route to build a layer 2 platform. Whatâ€™s next for your project? Migrate to full ZK rollup and onboard as many apps such as DeFi and gameFi as possible. What can your token be used for? Can be used as gas fee on our chain down the road.","links":"https://kroma.network/","market_cap":7265098,"market_cap_rank":2115,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kroma/logo.png","detail_platform":{"kroma":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x25500000d700bbe27104577cccce8eabcc96c8ad"}}}
