{"name":"destable coin","id":"destable-coin_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"destable","description":"What is Destable Coin? Destable Coin ($DEST) is not just another stablecoin—it’s a redefinition of what stability means in the digital era. While some see it as chaos, we see it as the future of stability: a dynamic asset designed to challenge traditional pegged models and introduce a new layer of resilience in decentralized finance. Unlike conventional stablecoins that are rigidly tied to fiat or single assets, Destable Coin thrives on controlled volatility and adaptive mechanisms. This approach creates a “destabilized stability” model that is more organic, transparent, and resistant to systemic risks. Key Points Redefining Stability: Moves beyond fiat-pegged concepts to introduce adaptive balance. Resilient by Design: Uses volatility as a feature, not a flaw, building a stronger ecosystem. Community-Driven: Built to evolve with its holders and governance model. Destable Coin isn’t about avoiding change—it’s about embracing it to build a stronger, more sustainable foundation for the future of DeFi. 👉 Learn more: destablecoin.live","links":"https://www.destablecoin.live/","market_cap":7039.36,"market_cap_rank":11835,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/destable-coin_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x3b2b271e7736db0f47ae4fb0c408c0c943d34444","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x3b2b271e7736db0f47ae4fb0c408c0c943d34444"}},"is_native":false}
