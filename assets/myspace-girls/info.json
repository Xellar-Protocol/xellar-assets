{"name":"Myspace Girls","id":"myspace-girls","symbol":"msg","description":"Before Vine. Before TikTok. Before OnlyFans... there was MySpace. MySpace Girls is a nightly livestream series meets meme coin — where early 2000s internet chaos gets a modern upgrade. We go live every night on Pump.fun, blending real-time content, community voting, and internet drama with a coin attached. Think social media livestreaming with a market cap — and every stream pushes the momentum of $MSG. This isn’t just nostalgia. We’re bringing back Top 8s, fan polls, comment walls, and the messy, addictive energy of the MySpace era — live and unfiltered. No charts. No lectures. No playbook. Just creators, content, and a coin that rides the vibe. You don’t need to know crypto. You just need to be online.","links":"https://www.myspacegirls.com/","market_cap":61717,"market_cap_rank":8193,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/myspace-girls/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"AptX3ut9fj787mTzjVm7wTgd6qfKrcpwMgAgHvhwfSQi","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/AptX3ut9fj787mTzjVm7wTgd6qfKrcpwMgAgHvhwfSQi"}}}
