Only a month after Thailand's adorable baby hippo Moo Deng was unveiled on Facebook, her fame became unstoppable both domestically and internationally. Zookeeper Atthapon Nundee has been posting cute moments of the animals in his care for about five years. He never imagined Khao Kheow Open Zoo's newborn pygmy hippo would become an internet megastar within weeks. Cars started lining up outside the zoo well before it opened Thursday. Visitors traveled from near and far for a chance to see the pudgy, expressive 2-month-old in person at the zoo about 60 miles southeast of Bangkok. The pit where Moo Deng lives with her mom, Jona, was packed almost immediately, with people cooing and cheering every time the pink-cheeked baby animal made skittish movements. \"It was beyond expectation,\" Atthapon told The Associated Press. \"I wanted people to know her. I wanted a lot of people to visit her, or watch her online, or leave fun comments. I never would've thought (of this).\" Moo Deng, which literally means \"bouncy pork\" in Thai, is a type of meatball. The name was chosen by fans via a poll on social media, and it matches her other siblings: Moo Toon (stewed pork) and Moo Waan (sweet pork). There is also a common hippo at the zoo named Kha Moo (stewed pork leg). \"She's such a little lump. I want to ball her up and swallow her whole!\" said Moo Deng fan Areeya Sripanya while visiting the zoo Thursday.","links":"https://khamoo.vip/","market_cap":19458.76,"market_cap_rank":9994,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/khamoo/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x8f66cf0f1db84f8ee2a46352409370a69ae4e059","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x8f66cf0f1db84f8ee2a46352409370a69ae4e059"}}}
