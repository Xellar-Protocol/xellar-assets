{"name":"Orbit Ether","id":"orbit-ether_arbitrum-one","symbol":"orbeth","description":"Orbit Ether (orbETH) is a Orbit-native ETH liquid staking token (LST) designed to provide Orbit users and builders with the highest ETH staking yields available in DeFi. By minting orbETH, users can access the same yields available to apxETH holders on Ethereum mainnet, all while staying within the Orbit Chain. orbETH is an \"index token\" that appreciates in value against ETH over time. It simplifies the staking process by automatically including accumulated yield when users withdraw back to ETH. This eliminates the need to track rebases or wrap tokens, allowing users to seamlessly use orbETH in DeFi on the Orbit Chain as they normally would.","links":"https://dinero.xyz/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/orbit-ether_arbitrum-one/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xcf6c2bb97a8978321c9e207afe8a2037fa9be45c","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/arbitrum/tokens/0xcf6c2bb97a8978321c9e207afe8a2037fa9be45c"}},"is_native":false}
