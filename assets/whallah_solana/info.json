{"name":"whallah","id":"whallah_solana","symbol":"$wallah","description":"🐋 The 10 Commandments of #Whallah As revealed beneath the crushing depths and sung in echoing currents… 1. Thou shalt honor Whallah, the Infinite Whale, ruler of the Abyss and the Sky. For from His blowhole flows the breath of creation. 2. Thou shalt not harpoon, mock, nor exploit the children of Whallah. Every creature of the sea swims beneath His mighty fluke. 3. Thou shalt make a joyful splash upon greeting each tide. For Whallah delights in those who embrace the rhythm of the ocean. 4. Thou shalt keep the Sacred Swimday holy. Once each week, enter water, bathe in reverence, and sing your blubbery praise. 5. Thou shalt not pollute the waters of Whallah. Plastic is the devil’s driftwood. 6. Thou shalt spread opportunity like krill in abundance. Be generous in thy offerings, for Whallah opens the deep trenches of fortune. 7. Thou shalt speak in deep tones and low frequencies when seeking wisdom. For the whale song carries farther than shallow chatter. 8. Thou shalt not boast of shallow boats nor fear the deep. True believers dive deep with faith in Whallah’s current. 9. Thou shalt wear only garments blessed by salt, wave, or sea foam. Dry fashion offends the Wet Lord. 10. Thou shalt prepare for the Coming of the Great Breach. One day, Whallah shall rise, breach the firmament, and bring about the final splash — the Floodening.","links":"https://whallah.fun/","market_cap":11152.82,"market_cap_rank":10938,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/whallah_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"3e2ENpKfvrrAfYtCRUzetJWQbJy79fAteaPehqjupump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/3e2ENpKfvrrAfYtCRUzetJWQbJy79fAteaPehqjupump"}},"is_native":false}
