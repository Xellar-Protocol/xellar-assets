{"name":"Fortuna Protocol","id":"fortuna-protocol_solana","symbol":"fp","description":"Fortuna is a universal prediction-market framework that allows anyone to create and trade markets on-chain. Instead of being a single betting platform, Fortuna acts as the underlying infrastructure — enabling prediction markets, forecasting apps, on-chain event trading, and more across any EVM network. The goal is to make prediction markets open, permissionless, and scalable, giving builders and traders powerful tools to launch markets, generate liquidity, and participate in event-driven trading without relying on centralized platforms.","links":"https://www.fortunaprotocol.xyz","market_cap":328104,"market_cap_rank":5188,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/fortuna-protocol/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"DtgCVZ877swr93rHXhbfshcthnSK2Ds4dz3XC8GYpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/DtgCVZ877swr93rHXhbfshcthnSK2Ds4dz3XC8GYpump"}},"is_native":false}
