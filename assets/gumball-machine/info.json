{"name":"Gumball Machine","id":"gumball-machine","symbol":"gum","description":"Gumball Machine is an experimental \"game of chance\" project combining ERC20, ERC1155, and ERC721 into a single new asset. It was created to test the limits of this new standard on Ethereum, innovate, and cultivate an exceptional community around this new technology. Inspired by Pandora, our goal is to bridge the gap between web3's NFT, Gamble-fi, and Memecoin communities and ultimately onboard hundreds of new users into DeFi through entertainment.","links":"https://docs.gumball.gg/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gumball-machine/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa72332af4a7efbce221903e7a09175be64f0400d"}}}
