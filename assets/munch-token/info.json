{"name":"Munch","id":"munch-token","symbol":"munch","description":"A decentralized and community-owned currency, MUNCH tokens are creating a fairer, more evenly distributed system that anyone can be a part of. All Munch transactions are subject to a 7% transaction fee that is distributed back to the community and charitable causes. Of this 7% collected,2% goes to marketing/buybacks and burns 2% will be redistributed to the community of MUNCH holders and 3% will be sent directly to a charitable cause, decided by the community. All donations and rewards are programmed to be inherently secure, automated, trustless, and immutable via the locked design of the contract. Weâ€™re biting back against traditional financial models and taking a bite out of poverty and hunger around the world at the same time. MUNCH gives people the opportunity to participate in a unique currency and marketplace, earn rewards, and distribute money to causes they support. The community decides the direction and future of MUNCH.","links":"https://munchproject.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/munch-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x944eee930933be5e23b690c8589021ec8619a301"},"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xc70636a779118e57e1c6fdafdd1f919fae912d2f"}}}
