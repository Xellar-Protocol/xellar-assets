{"name":"Bull Market Coin","id":"bull-market-coin_solana","symbol":"bull","description":"Bull Market Coin ($BULL) is a pure memecoin born to embody the raw energy, hype, and chaos of a true bull market. It has no utility, no promises, and no roadmap—just unrelenting momentum and a jacked bull mascot that captures the spirit of every degen who's ever ridden green candles straight into legend. $BULL isn’t trying to change the world. It’s not pretending to be the future of finance. It exists for one reason only: to celebrate the insanity, euphoria, and unapologetic optimism that defines every parabolic run. When the market flips green and everyone starts screaming “we're so back,” that’s Bull Market Coin’s moment to shine. At the center of the $BULL universe is its absurdly swole mascot—a bull so muscular and unhinged, he might as well be the physical manifestation of a 100x pump. He’s not here to negotiate or explain—he’s here to trample bears, flip chart patterns into oblivion, and bench press your weak hands. He is the bull market. But more than the mascot, Bull Market Coin lives through its community. The herd. The posters. The maniacs who wake up every morning and choose violence against market logic. This is a coin fueled by bullposting—a chaotic, meme-fueled movement that refuses to take anything seriously, except the sacred mission of going up only. The vibes are the utility. The memes are the message. Every post, every tweet, every “we’re early” copypasta adds fuel to the fire. If you’ve ever FOMO’d into a green candle, declared the bottom with zero evidence, or posted “bulls are back” because the 15-minute chart looked spicy—this is your coin. Bull Market Coin doesn’t ask for belief. It doesn’t need a use case. It’s the meme. It’s the culture. It’s the irrational confidence that somehow, this time, we’re never going back down. Whether we’re up 3% or 300%, the energy stays the same: loud, wild, and 100% bullish. So what’s Bull Market Coin about? It’s about embracing the madness. It’s about stomping bears into the dirt with memes and momentum. It’s about being part of the most unhinged, hype-fueled corner of the internet. No utility. No promises. Just bullish energy in its purest form. Welcome to the herd. 🐂","links":"https://www.bullmarket.run/","market_cap":3645.75,"market_cap_rank":12758,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bull-market-coin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"5cBPkTSaQ2UnPG7xLccQHYs3Sv6QFrAnEFgjsgVVbonk","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/5cBPkTSaQ2UnPG7xLccQHYs3Sv6QFrAnEFgjsgVVbonk"}},"is_native":false}
