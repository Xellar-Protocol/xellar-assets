{"name":"Uranus","id":"uranus-4","symbol":"uranus","description":"Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun, has been the punchline of space jokes for centuries. Discovered in 1781, its name has sparked endless laughter, a mix of unfortunate pronunciation and human immaturity. Beneath the humor, Uranus is one of the most unique planets in the solar system. It’s an ice giant with a pale blue glow, thanks to methane in its atmosphere. It spins on its side, has extreme seasons, faint rings, and dozens of moons named after literary legends. Still, despite its scientific intrigue, Uranus will always carry that cosmic smirk, proof that even in the vastness of space, some jokes are timeless.","links":"https://www.uranuscoin.org/","market_cap":52439615,"market_cap_rank":785,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/uranus-4/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"BFgdzMkTPdKKJeTipv2njtDEwhKxkgFueJQfJGt1jups","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/BFgdzMkTPdKKJeTipv2njtDEwhKxkgFueJQfJGt1jups"}}}
