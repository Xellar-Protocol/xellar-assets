{"name":"RGB","id":"rgb_lisk","symbol":"rgb","description":"We're a community driven NFT creation platform. We provide a canvas for the community to create art where each pixel is recorded onto the blockchain. These recorded pixels are then converted into a unique timelapse NFT. Each canvas is run for a certain time limit and then minted into these NFTs. Contributors to the canvas are then rewarded when the NFT is sold. Each pixel drawn gives a percentage share of the NFT sales. Our platform is running now and we've already minted our first NFT!","links":"https://rgblisk.io","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/rgb_lisk/logo.png","detail_platform":{"lisk":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0bf4a86ba09fb1bf45b10d49f10953f6bc8e8a3c","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/lisk/tokens/0x0bf4a86ba09fb1bf45b10d49f10953f6bc8e8a3c"}},"is_native":false}
