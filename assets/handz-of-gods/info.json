Liquidity blackhole of revenue-sharing tokens and onchain exposure through tax and voting mechanism What makes your project unique? Imagine owning exposure to a diverse array of trending on-chain tokens without having to accumulate each one individually but instead only buy one. That is exactly what $HANDZ aims to build — a crypto treasury funded by our tax mechanism. Through our 5 % buy & 5% sale tax mechanism, we can change the buyback address token each time the community votes for a specific token. Depending on the volatility/volume of $HANDZ, this could be a rapid process. For instance, as of today, if our buyback token is UNICHAD, we would need approximately $1m volume to be part of the top 10 holders, a feasible target in the present market environment. History of your project. Taxation and benefits for holders On every transaction, we apply a tax: - BUY tax: 3% goes to buy back the dedicated token automatically, 2% goes to our LP - SELL tax: 3% goes to buy back the dedicated token automatically, 1% goes to our LP, 1% in ETH (the god tax for selling $HANDZ holders will receive all revenue generated of our treasury. Hopefully will be pretty significant long term as revenue/projects we bought grows The top 50 $HANDZ holders will have the power to choose which token we buy back, increase or decrease the tax, invest in OTC deals - The top 250 holders can suggest any project they favor and put it up for voting among the top 50 holders.
