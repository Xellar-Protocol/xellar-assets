{"name":"Eversol Staked SOL","id":"eversol-staked-sol","symbol":"esol","description":"Eversol is a Solana Stake Pool, however, it differentiates from other SOL staking pools by dedicating a percentage of the staking rewards to the Treasury fund, which will be further on operated by the Eversol DAO. The main Eversol's mission is to assist DeFi and ecosystem growth by directly funding the projects carefully selected by the community, through the DAO Governance. In addition: • stake SOL tokens and obtain liquid ESOL tokens in return, to use them across Solana DeFi while earning staking rewards; • help decentralization by delegating to a stake pool, based on Eversol Delegation Strategy, rather than one validator.","links":"https://eversol.one/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/eversol-staked-sol/logo.png"}
