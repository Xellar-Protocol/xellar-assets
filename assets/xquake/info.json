{"name":"XQuake","id":"xquake","symbol":"xqk","description":"XQuake (XQK) is aiming to become the most widely accepted payment option in the global charity sector. Created and run on the XRP Ledger for its low fees and high transaction speed. Donation account is a unique feature of this project. The donation wallet is the main mechanic of our project. Initial supply of the donation wallet is 10% of the total token supply, but the wallet will always be publicly available and open, so anyone can make an extra donation or see the contents of the wallet. Based on community voting the percentage of current wallet holdings will be donated in time of need. The primary goal is to aid earthquake-affected areas, but over time XQuake will become the worldâ€™s ultimate charity money.","links":"https://xquake.org/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/xquake/logo.png","detail_platform":{"xrp":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":"rHKrPGdpaqNRqRvmsiqQhD6azqc4npWoLC"}}}
