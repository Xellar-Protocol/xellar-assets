{"name":"Cyclone Protocol","id":"cyclone-protocol","symbol":"cyc","description":"Cyclone is a multi-chain, non-custodial, privacy-preserving protocol. Cyclone applies zkSNARKs to enable transactional privacy by breaking the on-chain link between depositor and recipient addresses. It uses a smart contract that accepts coins/tokens deposits, which can be withdrawn by a different address. Whenever an asset is withdrawn from Cyclone, there is no way to link the withdrawal to the deposit for absolute privacy.","links":"https://cyclone.xyz/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cyclone-protocol/logo.png"}
