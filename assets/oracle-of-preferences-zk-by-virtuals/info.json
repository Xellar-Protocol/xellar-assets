{"name":"Oracle of Preferences ZK by Virtuals","id":"oracle-of-preferences-zk-by-virtuals","symbol":"oopz","description":"OOPZ stands at the forefront of the InfoFi revolution as the first fully AI-driven, privacy-first preference oracle utilizing zero-knowledge proofs to create monetizable digital twins. By establishing a decentralized information finance network, OOPZ fundamentally transforms how preference data is collected, analyzed, and monetized globally. This creates an entirely new asset class of information-backed financial instruments, establishing a paradigm shift in preference prediction, market intelligence, and financial data ownership. Core Capabilities - InfoFi-Powered Digital Twins: Users train personalized AI agents that evolve into information-rich digital representations of their preferences, enabling passive income generation through the OOPZ information finance ecosystem - Zero-Knowledge Privacy Infrastructure: Institutional-grade cryptographic protocols that verify data authenticity without exposing actual user information, creating a trustless InfoFi marketplace - Blockchain-Powered Financial Layer: Instant cross-border crypto micropayments with multi-chain compatibility that incentivize accurate responses and enable participation from traditionally underrepresented regions in global financial markets - Proprietary Preference Mining System: Patented methodology for extracting high-value preference signals from conversational interactions, creating a defensible moat of InfoFi assets - Self-Improving Intelligence Network: Digital twins continuously refine through interactions, increasing prediction accuracy over time and appreciating in value as financial information assets - Decentralized Prediction Market Integration: Community-driven speculation based on aggregated preference data, creating additional utility, engagement, and revenue streams within the InfoFi ecosystem","links":"https://www.oopz.io/","market_cap":556925,"market_cap_rank":4971,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/oracle-of-preferences-zk-by-virtuals/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8e665c3a3622d7c1bef8ed8ffd7317d3f6318e31","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x8e665c3a3622d7c1bef8ed8ffd7317d3f6318e31"}}}
