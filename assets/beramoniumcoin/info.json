{"name":"BeramoniumCoin","id":"beramoniumcoin","symbol":"beramo","description":"Beramonium is a premier Berachain-native gaming studio, building a multi-game ecosystem powered by Berachain. The first title, Beramonium Chronicles: Gemhunters, is an idle-RPG with Play & Earn (P&E) mechanics, where players send NFT-based Characters on missions to earn Gems and Equipment. These rewards enhance gameplay and unlock additional benefits within the Berachain ecosystem. Expanding on this foundation, Beramonium Chronicles: Adventures introduces a full-3D RPG designed to bridge the gap between web2 and web3 gaming. With seamless blockchain integration, players can engage at their own pace: in casual and fun way or through \"degen way\" with advanced economics & game-theory. $BERAMO is at the center of the Beramonium ecosystem. It's a heavily deflationary token that powers in-game mechanics. Beramonium aims to redefine sustainable web3 gaming by leveraging Berachain’s Proof of Liquidity (PoL) to create a positive-sum rewards system rather than relying on traditional player-extractive models.","links":"https://beramonium.io/","market_cap":137782,"market_cap_rank":7000,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/beramoniumcoin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"berachain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x1f7210257fa157227d09449229a9266b0d581337","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/berachain/tokens/0x1f7210257fa157227d09449229a9266b0d581337"}}}
