{"name":"IDRISS","id":"idriss_base","symbol":"idriss","description":"IDRISS is a monetization app for streamers. Think Patreon, but built for the live-streaming era with new ways for creators and fans to earn and engage. Streamers face major friction in how they earn: high platform cuts, payout delays, frozen accounts, and few ways for fans to share in their success. Existing tools fix the surface but still depend on traditional payment rails. IDRISS rebuilds the monetization layer for streamers onchain from the ground up: low-fee, instant, and creator-owned.","links":"https://idriss.xyz","market_cap":481228,"market_cap_rank":4642,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/idriss/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x000096630066820566162c94874a776532705231","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x000096630066820566162c94874a776532705231"}},"is_native":false}
