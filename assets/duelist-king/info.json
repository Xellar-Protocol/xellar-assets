{"name":"Duelist King","id":"duelist-king","symbol":"dkt","description":"Duelist King kickstarted with a technical litepaper around fair distribution algorithms for in-game assets (https://duelistking.com/DuelistKing_lite-paper.pdf). A team of 16 developers, designers, marketers and community builders based in SEA and Asia have started building the game since May 2021 and have finished a workable demo for private access. The project has raised 1 million from 15+ investors and will do a dual launch of IDO on OccamFi (October 21st) and IFO on Pancake Swap (October 27th). The core values of Duelist King are (1) Win2Earn where game economics tie to engagement in the game especially duels/battles against other gamers; (2) curated game play and game design to give users the real feeling of a game; (3) in-house infrastructure including Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), Oracle and Random Number Generator and lastly (4) engagement of the community of creators, gamers, investors as voters and decision makers of the game play and game design.","links":"https://duelistking.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/duelist-king/logo.png"}
