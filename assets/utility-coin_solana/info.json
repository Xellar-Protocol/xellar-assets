{"name":"Utility Coin","id":"utility-coin_solana","symbol":"utility","description":"The string \"FwrcPjGNdTbBXWBKktRvnNTnAfRNtv9nPDGV3gjgpump\" is the Solana contract address (CA) for $UTILITY, a meme coin launched on the Solana blockchain. It's positioned as \"The Useless Coin Killer,\" satirizing hype-driven memecoins by emphasizing \"real utility\" in a humorous way—think viral memes, community-driven narratives, and a mock \"contract scanner\" tool on its website. Inspired by quotes from crypto figures like CZ (Binance) and Anatoly (Solana), it taps into frustration with low-value tokens while embracing degen culture.","links":"https://www.theutilitycoin.com/","market_cap":9108.51,"market_cap_rank":11375,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/utility-coin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"FwrcPjGNdTbBXWBKktRvnNTnAfRNtv9nPDGV3gjgpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/FwrcPjGNdTbBXWBKktRvnNTnAfRNtv9nPDGV3gjgpump"}},"is_native":false}
