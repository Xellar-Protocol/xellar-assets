{"name":"CrossDEX","id":"crossdex","symbol":"cdx","description":"Cross-chain DEXs are based on aggregators and the ongoing work to establish DEXs. They use a brand-new multi-chain network technology to establish a pool of liquidity. By utilizing intelligent algorithms, asset diversification, rising liquidity and trading volumes, and expanding the market for decentralized finance, they allow users to transact across several blockchain ecosystems. For DeFi to fully benefit from the strength of interoperability and liquidity across several chains, cross-chain DEX is required. Without using wrapped tokens, bridges, or intermediary networks, CrossDEX gathers liquidity to facilitate swaps. No third-party authorities are engages during the process of swap. Everything works on smart-contracts and agreement of both sides.","links":"https://crossdex.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/crossdex/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x715c2f44e3653e44397de00de9d010c4664c456f"}}}
