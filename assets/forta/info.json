{"name":"Forta","id":"forta","symbol":"fort","description":"Forta is a real-time detection network for security & operational monitoring of blockchain activity. Forta is a decentralized, community-based monitoring network to detect threats and anomalies on DeFi, NFT, governance, bridges and other Web3 systems in real-time. Given timely and relevant alerts about the security and health of owned or dependent systems, protocols and investors can react quickly to neutralize threats and prevent or minimize loss of funds. Forta comprises a decentralized network of independent node operators that scan all transactions and block-by-block state changes for outlier transactions and threats. When an issue is detected, node operators send alerts to subscribers of potential risks, which enables them to take action. Leveraging Forta, developers can build detection bots and machine learning models, and run them on the decentralized Forta network to uncover anomalous activity on every blockchain transaction. Forta will be secured and governed by smart contracts and the use of the FORT utility and governance token.","links":"https://forta.org/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/forta/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x41545f8b9472d758bb669ed8eaeeecd7a9c4ec29"}}}
