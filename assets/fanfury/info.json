{"name":"Fanfury","id":"fanfury","symbol":"fury","description":"Fanfury's is a Daily Fantasy Sports World that uses a unique dystopian RPG-Lore format to combine traditional fantasy sports, sports fans, sports teams and high-yield defi primitives. Fanfury uses decentralized data oracles, smart contracts controlled gameplay, and value-associated deflationary tokenomics, to inject trust back into the game. The RPG Lore masks the DeFi side of the app, making it easy for traditional users to take part in reward programs like auto-compound staking and bonding, without having to interact directly with the underlying DeFi infrastructure.","links":"https://fury.fan/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/fanfury/logo.png"}
