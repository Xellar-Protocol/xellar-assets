Project/Company launched in January 2025, with the SHAFT token launch on September 8th, 2025, the SHAFT (Strategic Hub for AI-Focused Technology) is a social bounty funding platform designed to support the development of accessibility improving applications, tools, and integrations across AI and DeFAI. The project is built around a bounty board and community treasury that provide developers with opportunities to earn rewards, secure funding, and contribute to Web3<>AI ecosystem growth in a socially responsible manner.. The SHAFT Bounty Board functions as an open marketplace where sponsors can post challenges and developers can complete them in exchange for on-chain payments. Each completed bounty creates a verifiable record of work delivered, and is open-sourced via Github, allowing contributors to build on-chain reputations while producing open tools and applications. In addition to short-term tasks, SHAFT supports larger initiatives through direct project funding. Ideas proposed by the community can be allocated resources from the treasury, enabling teams to develop prototypes and expand them into working products. This process provides a structured path for founders moving from concept to implementation, and distribution within web3. The SHAFT token is used within the platform for rewards and to participate in governance. Token holders influence treasury allocations and proposals, giving the community a direct role in deciding which projects move forward.","links":"https://www.shaft.finance/","market_cap":88939,"market_cap_rank":7194,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/shaft-strategic-hub-for-ai-focused-technology/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"R6jVVLcdfpZ7tPLHQXZ4uZRFhBcE2L6aQoPgiJuV7j9","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/R6jVVLcdfpZ7tPLHQXZ4uZRFhBcE2L6aQoPgiJuV7j9"}},"is_native":false}
