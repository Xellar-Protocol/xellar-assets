{"name":"WINR Protocol","id":"winr-protocol_solana","symbol":"winr","description":"The WINR Protocol is a fully autonomous liquidity and incentive infrastructure explicitly built for on-chain games requiring a counterparty asset vault. Pool structure The WINR Liquidity pool consists of several ERC20 tokens and works as an index composition of assets in the basket. It functions as a multi-asset liquidity pool similar to the reserves of a web2 gaming protocol. The input and output currencies may differ, and proposed games may introduce a model where players have to use a specific token to play while getting paid out in another specific token. WLP Token The WLP ERC20 token represents the underlying assets in the WINR Liquidity Pool. It is a liquid token with a value of USD and be used as collateral or for farming strategies through various vaults. The price of WLP appreciates over time as players lose tokens, and these assets are added to the index composition. The WINR Protocol may host a variety of games and platforms. The main uses cases are but are not limited to: - Casinos - both Metaverse and DApps - Sports betting platforms - Betting platforms for on-chain games - Betting mechanisms inside the on-chain games - Rewarding mechanisms such as purchasable loot boxes within the on-chain games","links":"https://winr.games/","market_cap":1676402,"market_cap_rank":3150,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/winr-protocol_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"CsxCtA8usvWKdRhe7KhLU5GgwzYaLkoHsz1MKBVZ4W3M","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/CsxCtA8usvWKdRhe7KhLU5GgwzYaLkoHsz1MKBVZ4W3M"}},"is_native":false}
