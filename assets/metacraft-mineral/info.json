{"name":"Metacraft Mineral","id":"metacraft-mineral","symbol":"memi","description":"With the vision to unify and standardize GameFi sector and erase the borderline between Game and GameFi. Inspired by the Wiki engine, we're building Metacraft - a \"decentralized\" game studio where anyone can join build and play games together with us. We believe in the potential of GameFi but also realize some of its problems including trust, game quality, and fragmented. To solve these and make GameFi more mature, building a united GameFi ecosystem seems to be the next big thing. Metacraft Mineral (MEMI) will be the token to run Metacraft Framework, in which players do not just simply play our games and have fun. Rather than just a vague statement, the players can be actively involved in the development and improvement of the games as a builder. MEMI token is anticipated to hold the following utilities: - Selectively use to reward Builder based on their contribution - Reward for Esport Championship/Tournament - Game developer use MEMI to reward their Builders (Artist, Engineer, Storytellerâ€¦) - Fees on Collaboration Platform - Marketplace transaction fee across all games - Used across all games - Staking & Liquidity","links":"https://stormgate.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/metacraft-mineral/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"ATEMTyZVC1yDHYUg1aqHC6cpn8KVLe4Bbn7G74xSRDqG"}}}
