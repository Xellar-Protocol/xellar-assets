{"name":"Minto","id":"minto","symbol":"btcmt","description":"Minto is a unique DeFi platform for mining BTC. BTCMT tokens are backed by a real mining equipment hashrate in a 100 BTCMT = 1 TH/s ratio. Minto allows users to get daily income in bitcoins by staking BTCMT tokens. Mining rewards from all the emissions are shared only between those who staked BTCMT from the entire hashrate. As additional computing power is connected to the Minto project and the total hashrate increases, reward payouts increase accordingly. Minto is an international team that established a high-tech data center for Bitcoin mining with a capacity of over 40.000 miners. Minto uses energy of hydroelectric power plants, which do not harm the environment.","links":"https://minto.finance/","market_cap":3280824,"market_cap_rank":1849,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/minto/logo.png","detail_platform":{"huobi-token":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x410a56541bd912f9b60943fcb344f1e3d6f09567"},"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x410a56541bd912f9b60943fcb344f1e3d6f09567"}}}
