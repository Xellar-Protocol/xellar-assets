{"name":"Opera Protocol","id":"opera-protocol","symbol":"opera","description":"What is the project about? THE 1ST DAO GOVERNED REAL-YIELD GENERATING LIQUIDITY BANK FOR DEVELOPERS ON ETHEREUM What makes your project unique? OPERA works by allowing developers, builders, and degens to “get liquid” and fund their LPs (Liquidity Pools) with ETH, without having to ask anyone or wait for anything. $OPERA holders can choose to stake their tokens with the DAO to provide liquidity to new tokens, and earn a passive % of trading fees virtually risk free. Developers can then borrow some ETH from the DAO to launch their tokens in a 100% safe and seamless way. ”Miners” (DAO members) can view our dashboard and see all tokens utilizing Opera Liquidity. History of your project. The OPERA Protocol itself primarily serves 3 groups of people. Borrowers that want to launch tokens without the hassle of providing and locking personal funds for liquidity, and the lenders which want to lend their tokens to those borrowers to be used as liquidity. There are also people that just want to participate in the ecosystem, (via holding and staking, voting, etc.) and be a part of something that is helping hundreds of developers get liquid every single day. Anyone can participate on any side, supply or demand. Or even all three sides at once! The opportunities are vast and will grow as the network & ecosystem expands. The protocol ties everything together in a decentralized way, ensuring that there is distributed ownership of the project in every possible way.
