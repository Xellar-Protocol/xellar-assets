{"name":"RematicEGC","id":"rematicegc","symbol":"rmtx","description":"RMTX is the Crosschain Token (ETH, POLY, BSC) that provided 10% holder reflections with an additional 1% automated buy back and burn. RMTX is the inaugural token of Rematic Tokens and rewards investors in three ways. First, 10% of all buys, sells, and transfers (not across chains, that free) are distributed to holders. Second, the automated buyback and burn makes RMTX a deflationary token, thus raising the value to all holders over time. Third, and most importantly, as the premier token of Rematic Tokens, a portion of all profits obtained from business generated revenue will be distributed in the form of dividend payments and/or additional RMTX token burns. The vision of Rematic Tokens LLC (RTL) is to bring a trusted, professional, and business level execution of product development and services to the cryptocurrency, commercial, and public/federal space for its clients and communities. RTL is a legal entity established in the state of Virginia, operating globally.
