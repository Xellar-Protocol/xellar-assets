Bond issuance will be used to acquire governance tokens from the projects that employ liquidity gauges and locking mechanisms as exchange incentives. By using a portion of the voting power accrued by the Orkan, the protocol will enable deep liquidity and usage of wrapped BTC assets within Fantom.","links":"https://orkan.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/orkan/logo.png","detail_platform":{"fantom":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xfb66e49e303a186a4c57414ceeed651a7a78161a"}}}
