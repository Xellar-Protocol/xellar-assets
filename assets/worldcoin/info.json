Its 30 seconds average transaction confirmation time makes it ideal for everyday micro transactions like the purchase of coffee or groceries. Worldcoin is a deflationary currency with only 265,420,800 coins ever going to be created. Since it is decentralized, there is no central authority that issues this currency unlike fiat currencies.
