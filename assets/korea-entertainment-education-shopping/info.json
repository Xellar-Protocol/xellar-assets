{"name":"Korea Entertainment Education & Shopping","id":"korea-entertainment-education-shopping","symbol":"kees","description":"\"By combining voice, text, and video-based communication technologies and large-scale video curation technologies, KEES Platform provides a variety of community spaces for K-Culture. Additionally, it provides K-fandom communities and global user communities in various fields of interest related to the Hallyu through functions such as producing multilingual scripts. Furthermore, through video commerce and fintech technologies, various K-products, including goods, can be sold in conjunction with K-video content on the platform. Although there are some corporates (players) in the K-themed 3C field (Communication, Contents & Commerce), there are no platforms as a hub. For example, currently, there are many different services about K-pop culture, yet there is not an integrated K-Culture Hub. Therefore, we are implementing a platform that provides Korean content and product information to users around the world.\"","links":"http://www.kees.life/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/korea-entertainment-education-shopping/logo.png"}
