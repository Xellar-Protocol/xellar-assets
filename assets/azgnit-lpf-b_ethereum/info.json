Azoth does not belong to any individual or entity, but to every person who supports the Web3 vision, to every participant, developer, and user who believes in open, fair, and transparent rules, enabling everyone to become a participant in RWA-Fi and thus promoting the development of RWA-Fi. We screen real-world assets and list their RWA products for users to purchase the assets they want. On Azoth, users can access due diligence reports on screened real-world assets and industry research on the RWA market, and then select their preferred high-quality RWA projects through a voting mechanism. After that, users can directly purchase assets on the Azoth platform by linking their wallets.","links":"https://azoth.finance/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/azgnit-lpf-b/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"0x87c1d38f82edb10123ed73e39d3053097bee8bf6","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x87c1d38f82edb10123ed73e39d3053097bee8bf6"}},"is_native":false}
