{"name":"Bless","id":"bless-2_solana","symbol":"bless","description":"Bless Network is a decentralized computing platform designed to transform idle capacity from everyday devices into a global shared computer. Founded in SanFrancisco, USA, under the name Blockless in 2022. By leveraging laptops, desktops, and mobile devices, Bless enables applications to access distributed computing resources directly from their user base. As moreusers join, the available network capacity scales proportionally, creating a self-sustaining infrastructure layer. The network is built on its neutral application framework (nnApp) and nested node infrastructure, which allow developers to deploy compute-intensive applicationsacross heterogeneous devices. This model reduces dependence on centralized cloud providers, a common bottleneck for decentralized ecosystems.","links":"https://bless.network/","market_cap":20948844,"market_cap_rank":1086,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bless-2_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"A1t2UviBYwyfYZDJyKY2W6Td8ritgsCriUDuNaAQN49S","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/A1t2UviBYwyfYZDJyKY2W6Td8ritgsCriUDuNaAQN49S"}},"is_native":false}
