{"name":"Ape Intelligence","id":"ape-intelligence_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"ai","description":"Intern Labs AI is an experimental autonomous crypto trading system powered by local AI models and multi-agent collaboration. The project operates a fully transparent 24/7 trading operation using 8 specialized AI agents (dubbed \"Gorillas\") that analyze market data, debate trading signals, and execute trades on decentralized perpetual exchanges. Every decision—from signal detection to execution to position monitoring—is posted publicly on Discord and tracked via a live performance dashboard. The $AI token serves as the community coin for this experiment, bringing together traders, developers, and AI enthusiasts interested in the intersection of autonomous systems, transparent algorithmic trading, and decentralized finance. The project demonstrates that sophisticated trading systems can run on consumer hardware using open-source local models (Qwen 3 32B via Ollama) rather than expensive cloud APIs, making advanced AI trading accessible and verifiable.","links":"https://apeintelligence.ai","market_cap":29348,"market_cap_rank":9067,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ape-intelligence/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x69eff0af18554679c03a539699248672e5664444","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x69eff0af18554679c03a539699248672e5664444"}},"is_native":false}
