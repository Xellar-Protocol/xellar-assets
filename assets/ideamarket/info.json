{"name":"Ideamarket","id":"ideamarket","symbol":"imo","description":"If Bitcoin is \"money without banks,\" Ideamarket is \"credibility without media corporations.\" We want the world’s best information to reach the public in weeks instead of years. The live site is a court of public opinion — delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) for information verification. Instead of media corporations deciding what's true, it's trusted users \"elected\" by other users via staked $IMO. Ideamarket enables prediction markets based on public opinion, which blows open the doors on what prediction markets are able to address. - I bet $100 that [Epstein didn't kill himself] will be rated above [50] on [Jan 1, 2023] - I bet $100 that [UFOs are piloted by aliens] will be rated above [50] on [Jan 1, 2023] - etc This is already possible today. If it works, there's no longer a gatekeeper when it comes to spreading information credibly.","links":"https://ideamarket.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ideamarket/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb41bd4c99da73510d9e081c5fadbe7a27ac1f814"}}}
