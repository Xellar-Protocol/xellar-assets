{"name":"Inflation Adjusted USDS","id":"inflation-adjusted-usds","symbol":"iusds","description":"Spice Trade protocol is introducing a new revolutionary concept: A stable coin that automatically adjusts and protects against inflation. On a monthly basis, as U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics releases CPI data, the peg for iUSDS adjusts to account for inflation (or deflation). The goal here is to create a stable coin that maintains the relative purchasing power of USD. The formula is as follows: Peg (iUSDS) = $1 / Buying Power Coefficient where Buying Power Coefficient (or BPC) = CPI as of January 2022 / Current CPI For example, as of May 2022, the latest CPl data published by BLS is for March 2022: March 2022: 287.504 January 2022: 281.148 Source: https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/supplemental-files/home.htm Therefore, Current BPC = 0.97789 and Peg (iUSDS) = 1/0.97789 = $1.0226 As BLS data updates over time, BPC gets updated based on a ramp up (or down) function to avoid sudden moves in the peg.","links":"https://spicetrade.ai","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/inflation-adjusted-usds/logo.png"}
