{"name":"0xBitcoin","id":"oxbitcoin_ethereum","symbol":"0xbtc","description":"The first pure mined ERC20 Token for Ethereum, using the soliditySHA3 hashing algorithm. This is a smart contract which follows the original Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper to form a fundamentally sound trustless currency. This combines the scarcity and fair distribution model of Bitcoin with the speed and extensibility of the Ethereum network. Thus, it is named 0xBitcoin or 0xBTC where 0x represents the Ethereum Network and ecosystem.","links":"https://0xbitcoin.org/","market_cap":868427,"market_cap_rank":3911,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/oxbitcoin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"0xb6ed7644c69416d67b522e20bc294a9a9b405b31","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xb6ed7644c69416d67b522e20bc294a9a9b405b31"}},"is_native":false}
