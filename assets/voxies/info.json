{"name":"Voxies","id":"voxies","symbol":"voxel","description":"Voxies is a free-to-play, 3D turn-based tactical RPG game on blockchain. The main gameplay of Voxies is similar to a traditional RPG and tactical game, but it is powered by blockchain technology and ownership is central to the core concepts of the game. As a team-based tactical game, players can control multiple characters in the game and each character can be represented by Voxies that are directly owned as NFTs, or provided by the game for free-to-play players. VOXEL is Voxies' native utility token and will be used as the currency inside the Voxie Tactics game and will be utilized for all in-game functionality, such as purchasing new weapons, armor or items to use in the game. VOXEL tokens can also be earned by playing the game and doing certain tasks — for example after each battle you will be rewarded with VOXEL tokens (and potentially rarer NFT item rewards!) depending on the success of the battle. Exploration mode will also present ways to ‘find’ and collect VOXEL token, helping out NPCs in the world and completing quests for them is another way to potentially earn rewards and VOXEL tokens.","links":"https://voxies.io/","market_cap":27645931,"market_cap_rank":807,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/voxies/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd0258a3fd00f38aa8090dfee343f10a9d4d30d3f"}}}
