{"name":"Plutus DPX","id":"plutus-dpx","symbol":"plsdpx","description":"plsDPX is a liquid staking derivative of the veDPX token. Plutus allows users to convert their DPX to plsDPX so they may earn the underlying veDPX rewards while maintaining a liquid position through the plsDPX token. In exchange, the governance power of the underlying veDPX token is passed on to PLS holders. This allows PLS holders to vote on both general governance decisions as well as the DPX gauge allocation in the future. In addition, users are offered the option to stake their plsDPX on Plutus which earns them additional PLS rewards.","links":"https://plutusdao.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/plutus-dpx/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf236ea74b515ef96a9898f5a4ed4aa591f253ce1"}}}
