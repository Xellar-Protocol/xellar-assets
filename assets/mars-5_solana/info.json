{"name":"MARS","id":"mars-5_solana","symbol":"mars","description":"Mars Token is a community-driven crypto project built to support wildlife conservation efforts, starting with a real-world impact at Tanganyika Wildlife Park in Kansas. Inspired by the birth of a baby pygmy hippo on June 26, 2025, the Mars community rallied to raise over $3,000 in donations to help name and support the animal—now officially named “Mars.” This project blends blockchain innovation with real-world giving. Through creator rewards, NFT campaigns, and merchandise, Mars Token creates ongoing funding opportunities for endangered species while rewarding holders with unique digital collectibles and future perks like special access to the park. Mars isn’t just a token—it’s a mission to make crypto meaningful by driving awareness, donations, and long-term support for animal conservation.","links":"https://www.themarsproject.us/","market_cap":101404,"market_cap_rank":6978,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mars-5_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"Cfmo6asAsZFx6GGQvAt4Ajxn8hN6vgWGpaSrjQKRpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/Cfmo6asAsZFx6GGQvAt4Ajxn8hN6vgWGpaSrjQKRpump"}},"is_native":false}
