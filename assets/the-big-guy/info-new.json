{"name":"The Big Guy","id":"the-big-guy","symbol":"bguy","description":"The Big Guy is a transformational project that embraces the stickiness and deep cultural and social significance of deities. The central thesis for the project is that to onboard those outside of crypto and to raise the social awareness for digital assets, there needs to be a uniting project that is not esoteric, derivative, or otherwise irrelevant to general society. There are no other subjects in the world that hold as much relevance and common ground as the significance of deities. The Big Guy Universe represents a fusion of iconic historical figures, cryptoâ€™s heroes and villains, its most meme-able characters, and is inspired by enduring crypto lore, popular literature, and the rich narratives of various spiritual traditions. The creative roadmap seeks to build on the rapidly expanding meme culture on Base into a Web2 and Web2.5 brand. To achieve this, the roadmap prioritizes character development and evaluation of opportunities for expansive social awareness, monetization, and cultural growth.","links":"https://thebigguy.xyz/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/the-big-guy/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x8931ee05ec111325c1700b68e5ef7b887e00661d"}}}
