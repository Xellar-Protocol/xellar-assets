{"name":"Avail","id":"avail_ethereum","symbol":"avail","description":"Avail’s modular architecture brings together two essential infrastructure layers that form the backbone of a unified onchain economy. Avail Nexus is the multichain infra layer that unifies how applications, users, and liquidity interact across ecosystems. Through a single integration, Nexus lets developers connect their apps to liquidity and users from any chain, without bridges, redeployments, or gas complexity. At its core, Nexus is an intent engine that handles cross-chain routing, transaction execution, and funds settlement on behalf of users and the apps they use. For developers, Nexus transforms fragmented cross-chain experiences into a single flow that unlocks new markets, drives higher retention, and expands reach across the entire onchain economy. Avail DA is a high-throughput cryptographically verified data availability (DA) layer that ensures all transaction data is available, verifiable, and accessible to anyone. Using KZG polynomial commitments and data availability sampling (DAS), Avail DA enables rollups and modular chains to scale efficiently without compromising security. Avail DA features the fastest DA finality of any other live DA layer today. Combined, these layers unlock seamless interoperability and scalability for the next generation of modular, multichain applications.","links":"https://www.availproject.org/","market_cap":24449189,"market_cap_rank":999,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/avail_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xeeb4d8400aeefafc1b2953e0094134a887c76bd8","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xeeb4d8400aeefafc1b2953e0094134a887c76bd8"}},"is_native":false}
