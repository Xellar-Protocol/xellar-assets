MOTION’s mantra is to comprehensively solve the problems of existing centralized health and wellness systems. Today’s centralized health and wellness systems suffer from issues like the lack of secure, decentralized, and trustworthy electronic health data, Industry is also suffering from counterfeit and supply chain leaks for Sports & Fitness Supplements. MOTION would be focused to enhance the health and wellness of its users. MOTION will use blockchain, machine learning, and Non- Fungible Tokens to achieve this vision. Today, health data is controlled by a few industry intermediaries who collect, control and consume data through their wearables and mobile apps. MOTION wants to change this trend and empower its users to control their health data. For this, MOTION will use Blockchain because this transformational technology offers us a chance to bring back the control of the health data to the users. Blockchain can solve issues related to data ownership with its decentralized architecture. It will help restore health data control to the user by empowering them to determine who has access to their information online. It is a paradigm shift in how health data is dealt with. This will offer consumers much- needed control over their health data.","links":"https://themotion.app/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/motion-motn/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
