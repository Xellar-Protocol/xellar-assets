{"name":"Neon Coin","id":"neon-coin","symbol":"neon","description":"$NEON is a token intended to spread positivity and light. With the space being dictated by money hungry influencers, $NEON aims to provide utility to those who are optimistic and selfless in the space. Most token launches end up with the influencer using their community as exit liquidity. Whereas $NEON has zero token allocation to founders and instead the founders bought the pre-sale with the rest of the investors. Not only will holders be incentivized to hold, but they will be rewarded because of the deflationary aspect of the token. A one percent burn tax is implemented on every token sale, meaning that supply decreases, resulting in increased value. There is also a 5% BURN TAX for MEV BOTS. This means our smart contract can detect a MEV BOT sandwich attack and will burn 5% of its tokens upon a sale. Not only is there a 1% burn tax, but holders will be incentivized to burn small amounts through a BURN 2 EARN mechanic. Neon aims to provide utility, by being a utility token for Neon Apes existing communities.","links":"https://neoncoin.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/neon-coin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6ee9742d17b527e682248dca85952e4fe190061d"}}}
