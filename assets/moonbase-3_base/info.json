{"name":"MOONBASE","id":"moonbase-3_base","symbol":"moonbase","description":"Moonbase is the first memecoin ever deployed on the Base blockchain, created on July 13th, 2023 — long before the ecosystem became what it is today. With a total supply of 69,420 tokens, it represents the origin of memecoin culture on Base and stands as a symbol of onchain history. The project recently completed visual and data updates on Dexscreener and DEXTools, reinforcing its identity and transparency. Moonbase’s mission is to preserve the early spirit of Base through authenticity, scarcity, and community-driven storytelling — a tribute to those who were there from day one.","links":"https://moonbasebuilder.com","market_cap":148036,"market_cap_rank":6381,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/moonbase-3_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd4306991f8a5cef2d2bcb3262224ded11bd18bad","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xd4306991f8a5cef2d2bcb3262224ded11bd18bad"}},"is_native":false}
