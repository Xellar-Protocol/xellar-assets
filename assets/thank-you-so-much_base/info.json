{"name":"Thank You So Much","id":"thank-you-so-much_base","symbol":"tysm","description":"$TYSM (Thank You So Much) is the native token of the Gratitude Economy, a movement that turns appreciation into permanent, on-chain value. The $TYSM Mini-App on Farcaster lets anyone send a thank-you as a tip, stake tokens, and see rewards stream in real time. The system is built on a regenerative loop: Buy → Stake → Stream → Tip → Share → Repeat. Staking strengthens network security and locks supply; streaming rewards reinforce holding; tipping widens distribution and cultural reach; sharing attracts new participants. This creates a self-sustaining flywheel where social recognition becomes measurable economic activity. $TYSM is designed to be simple for users, composable for builders, and durable for long-term participants who value alignment, transparency, and human-centric utility.","links":"https://farcaster.xyz/~/channel/fc","market_cap":166653,"market_cap_rank":6204,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/thank-you-so-much/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0358795322c04de04ead2338a803a9d3518a9877","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x0358795322c04de04ead2338a803a9d3518a9877"}},"is_native":false}
