{"name":"Odin","id":"odin-2","symbol":"odin","description":"Odin is a dog who was mistaken for a Coyote and shot and now the \"#JusticeForOdin\" movement has started to roar on every single social media platform. The #JusticeForOdin movement which the end goal is \"Odin's Law\" - that every animal control officer and cop has to bear non-lethal in case of a similar situation, this is happening everywhere in the states and it's not the first case, but this can make a huge change! This is more than just a memecoin, this is a movement to support all pet owners to make a change in the real world and make it a safer place for our furry friends.","links":"https://x.com/odinCTO","market_cap":82197,"market_cap_rank":6235,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/odin-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"2YHtwbcXFPfNcijXQztYpdYfPhpf82oLBqaq1rWipump"}}}
