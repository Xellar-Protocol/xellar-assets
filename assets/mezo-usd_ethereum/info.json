{"name":"Mezo USD","id":"mezo-usd_ethereum","symbol":"musd","description":"MUSD is Mezo's native stablecoin, 100% backed by Bitcoin reserves and designed to maintain a 1:1 value with the US dollar. This is advantageous compared to other DeFi lending platforms due to the competitive collateralization requirements in the market, which are significantly more capital-efficient compared to other major DeFi protocols. To ensure that the entire stablecoin supply remains fully backed by collateral, if a position falls under the minimum collateral ratio, it will be closed (liquidated). This ensures the health and stability of the MUSD model.
