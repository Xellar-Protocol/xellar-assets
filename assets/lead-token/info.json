Lead Wallet revenue will be generated from all the services offered via the lead wallet with a quarterly audit report. Every Quarter, Lead team will conduct an audit of all the earnings from Lead Wallet, after which 30% of the total net profit will be used to buy back a portion of the Lead token, which will be permanently burnt.
