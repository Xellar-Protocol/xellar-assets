{"name":"Doug","id":"doug-2","symbol":"doug","description":"DOUG CTO exists to redefine what it means to build a community token. Born from betrayal and abandoned leadership, the project was reclaimed by its holders — not to chase hype, but to create a foundation of trust, transparency, and long-term value. We believe that the future of decentralized finance belongs to those who lock in, not those who sell out. That’s why we’ve secured a significant portion of the total supply, proving our commitment isn’t just talk — it’s on-chain. Our mission is to empower every holder to become a builder, every trade to support progress, and every setback to fuel innovation. Doug CTO is no longer a meme — it’s a movement.","links":"https://www.dougcto.com/","market_cap":182244,"market_cap_rank":5828,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/doug-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"AQiE2ghyFbBsbsfHiTEbKWcCLTDgyGzceKEPWftZpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/AQiE2ghyFbBsbsfHiTEbKWcCLTDgyGzceKEPWftZpump"}}}
