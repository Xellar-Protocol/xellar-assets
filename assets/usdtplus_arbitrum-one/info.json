The pegging mechanism is based on the ‘NAV of 1’ policy (“Net Asset Value”), i.e. market value of assets equals the amount of USDT+ in circulation. This is achieved by: – Conservative risk management aims to avoid daily losses by building a diversified portfolio of highly conservative DeFi Investments – Daily distribution of profits in the form of a rebase to USDT+ holders; all yield collected by the USDT+ reserves are distributed to USDT+ holders directly by increasing their wallet balance once a day Use a liquidity index reflecting the current ratio of the number of issued USDT+ tokens to the volume of assets on strategies (Strategy), expressed in USDT.","links":"https://overnight.fi/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/usdtplus_arbitrum-one/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0xb1084db8d3c05cebd5fa9335df95ee4b8a0edc30","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/arbitrum/tokens/0xb1084db8d3c05cebd5fa9335df95ee4b8a0edc30"}},"is_native":false}
