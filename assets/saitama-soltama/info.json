{"name":"Saitama (SOLTAMA)","id":"saitama-soltama","symbol":"soltama","description":"Soltama, raised like a phoenix after the departure of the original developer, is embraced by a community that sees immense value and potential. Inheriting the ethos of the original Saitama on the Ethereum network, Soltama strives to be the Saitama of the Solana network. With a purpose to become the anti-jeet token, our community is looking long term and has survived against the odds. We have OG investors from the Saitama Eth coin, and we believe the brand itself attracts strong HODLers. We have implemented two main features that guarantee sustainable growth for the project - the Community Trust Fund, used for marketing purposes and for purchasing Soltama tokens, and also the Soltama Safety Fund, which is a wallet that holds a pool of Soltama tokens to protect and heighten the floor to mitigate the effect of large dumps.","links":"https://soltama.live","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/saitama-soltama/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"BpD8kZ2DdKpUej5LFhC2TRDGB2cG9wPgDyF4VN4SabBz"}}}
