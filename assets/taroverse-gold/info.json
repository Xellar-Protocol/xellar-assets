{"name":"Taroverse Gold","id":"taroverse-gold","symbol":"tgold","description":"Taroverse Gold Token (TGOLD) can be earned by playing the Monster Bash game. The digital asset serves as a replacement for reward points and will be used to upgrade stats of heroes within the game to climb higher rank and levels leading to higher rewards. The upgrades will reset at the end of every season thus preventing farming and hyperinflation. TGOLD are BEP-20 tokens, and they can be used to mint Hero Chest via no loss lottery. The cost of one lottery ticket will be around 20 USD worth TGOLD token. It can take time to accrue TGOLD token via Monster Bash as the rewards at early levels will be super low thus forcing players to collect and upgrade the hero stats to climb higher levels. Purchasing TGOLD on the open market is a way for gamers to get a headstart.","links":"https://www.taroverse.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/taroverse-gold/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6d91ed61ce0af2bd8b9037462443385a72dcb1de"}}}
