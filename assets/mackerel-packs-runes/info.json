{"name":"MACKEREL•PACKS (Runes)","id":"mackerel-packs-runes","symbol":"macks","description":"MACKEREL•PACKS is a Bitcoin Rune Token. It is a Cartoon Meme based underwater in 'Alcatrout Offshore Prison'. http://MackerelPacks.com X:@MackerelPacks TG:@MackerelPacks In real life, inmates nowadays trade Mackerel packets instead of trading cigarettes which are banned and stamps which are used less often due to more people emailing. We have created the Crypto Token meme based on this popular real life prison trading asset, Mackerel Packs. The characters in Alcatrout are varied. So far we have designed the Confish gang, led by the dastardly Mackerel King who is attempting to corner the market on MackPacks and escape from Alcatrout. We are also designing Heroes of Alcatrout and other characters. (This entire ecosystem and the characters within it are fictional and not based on anyone in the real world, any similarities are merely coincidental). We have a road map (Road Mack) and many future plans such as the creation of a Crypto Education Program, Donations for Charity, Meme Contests and other exciting Campaigns, including future Airdrops and possibly a limited edition ordinal collection with the art, amongst other exciting ideas. We can currently be bought at MagicEden and OKX Bitcoin Runes Marketplaces. Join us and #StackMacks to become a Mackerel Packs Millionaire.","links":"https://mackerelpacks.com/","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mackerel-packs-runes/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ordinals":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"848886:178"}}}
