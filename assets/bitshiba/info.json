{"name":"BitShiba","id":"bitshiba","symbol":"shiba","description":"Unlike Bitcoin, BitShiba is a fixed supply token with no new minting. All tokens that will ever exist have already been created. We believe in a truly fair and decentralized world so $SHIBA launched 100% fair with no presale and no team tokens. 50% of all BitShiba tokens were added directly to liquidity on Pancakeswap and the remaining 50% were intentionally destroyed forever by sending them to the 0x000... burn address. DEX Liquidity is locked until 2099. The BitShiba community controls 100% of all tokens.","links":"https://bitshiba.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bitshiba/logo.png"}
