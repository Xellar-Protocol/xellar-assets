{"name":"CyOp Protocol","id":"cyop-protocol","symbol":"cyop","description":"A CyOp is a disruptive, community governed event in the Cryptosphere, triggered by the CyOp Protocol and altering the tokenomics of a coin. · CyOp tokens can be used to vote for any given token on the ethereum chain to get disrupted. · In this process, the CyOp tokens will get locked for a time period, resulting in a deflationary effect. · Once enough energy has been build up the CyOp Protocol will be executed and the winner token will experience a disruptive market buy order using 90% of the CyOp fund. · All the tokens that have been bought will then be sucked into the resulting void and therefore, burned forever. · One holder who voted for the winner token will experience a matrix glitch in his favour and is also awarded 10% of the CyOp fund.","links":"https://cyop.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cyop-protocol/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xddac9c604ba6bc4acec0fbb485b83f390ecf2f31"}}}
