{"name":"Fluid Protocol","id":"fluid-protocol","symbol":"fpt","description":"\"Fluid Protocol is a decentralized borrowing and lending platform that allows users to obtain 0% interest-free loans by depositing collateral and receiving $USDF, the native stablecoin of Fuel. Inspired by liquity, a tried and proven decentralized stablecoin, Fluid protocol maintains a fixed minimum collateral ratio of 135%, supports multiple collateral types, and implements partial liquidations. Utilizing a governance-free algorithmic fiscal policy, Fluid Protocol aims to provide a secure and censorship-resistant solution that ensures stability and liquidity for its users. Stakeholders can hold onto their deposited collateral tokens by unlocking liquidity for Fuel networks most popular assets and minting USDF. They will then be able to use the USDF to participate in DeFi activities, or they can stake their USDF to earn FPT rewards, which is Fluid’s native utility token (which accrues yield in the form of Fluid’s accepted collateral types). \"","links":"https://fluidprotocol.xyz/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/fluid-protocol/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
