{"name":"Qwery","id":"qwery_solana","symbol":"qwery","description":"Qwery is a developer-focused payment infrastructure layer built on Solana. The platform provides APIs, modular SDKs, and an x402-style facilitation engine that enables pay-per-call payments, API monetization, and token-gated access without requiring backend development. Qwery handles transaction orchestration, priority-fee tuning, compute budgeting, and structured logging, allowing developers to integrate on-chain payments in minutes. The $QWERY token functions as a governance and utility-alignment asset used for protocol decisions, access tiers, ecosystem incentives, and long-term infrastructure coordination. Qwery is designed for builders who need a reliable, production-ready payment layer with transparent, consistent development.","links":"https://qwery.xyz/","market_cap":3718.24,"market_cap_rank":12744,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/qwery/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"5xcRDXCC7CGSMyiaiL127GsLGt6vU3ChK1KWFtRhpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/5xcRDXCC7CGSMyiaiL127GsLGt6vU3ChK1KWFtRhpump"}},"is_native":false}
