{"name":"Link on Sol","id":"link-on-sol","symbol":"link","description":"Link on Solana is a memecoin inspired by Chainlink running on the Solana blockchain. It pokes fun at the token's community's unease in the way of a new parody. The token is a parody of the original, to which it has no affiliation. It is built for laughs, community vibes, without the necessity of having a utility. It is built as a community-driven project as a playful nod to the link marines and its community.","links":"https://linkonsol.com","market_cap":105873,"market_cap_rank":6036,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/link-on-sol/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"GF4mRrsd52LHBZ4Fj9ijEwHCnh7c2wTMwDKwZQqipump"}}}
