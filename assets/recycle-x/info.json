{"name":"Recycle-X","id":"recycle-x","symbol":"rcx","description":"This project is a recycling project. In the Recycle-X project, you will purchase garbage with $RCX token and stake it to purify garbage just like farming. When the waste left to purify is converted to energy, you will be paid for the energy, of course, with $RCX. Once the smart container system and the pilot zone have been selected, Smart container will parse your household (plastic, glass, metal) trash with Smart container system, and Smart container will pay you $RCX token with QR code. That way, youâ€™ll get income from your trash and become an environmentalist There will be a section where you can read your QR Code and receive coin payouts. It will work by taking energy from the solar panels on it. Incoming vehicles are weighed full. As a result of laboratory verification analysis, if applicable, the disposal is accepted and the menu is prepared according to the calories, physical and chemical properties of waste in the bunkers. In 800oC in the rotary oven, gas is released in an oxygen-free environment, and the remaining part is removed as ash. In the second combustion chamber, the contents of hazardous and chemical components are disposed of by breaking apart, with a transition time of 2-3 seconds in 1100oC. The gases generated are passed through the three-stage chimney gas filtration system and reduced to below the limits. Emissions are monitored by the continuous emission measurement system and can be monitored by the State Agency. The production of electrical energy is carried out by transferring the waste heat exchanger to the gas turbine.","links":"https://recyclextoken.info/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/recycle-x/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6fb8889b3c5d79a4c855d4de56ce3b742d8e0eba"}}}
