{"name":"Warlords of Solana","id":"warlords-of-solana","symbol":"wlos","description":"WLOS (Warlords of Solana) is a Solana-based utility token powering an ecosystem centered around gamified DeFi. The project integrates staking, NFT farming, and mission-based hero mechanics. WLOS is distributed through a 10% transactional fee that funds farming rewards, staking APYs, mission pools, development, and deflationary burns. Users can earn WLOS by staking or deploying NFT characters (Farmers or Heroes) that generate token-based returns. The platform aims to merge community incentives with light strategy mechanics in preparation for a larger game release.","links":"https://wlos.dev","market_cap":5575.44,"market_cap_rank":10087,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/warlords-of-solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"Fqag5o95nYJ4wof9VgSJmN1RiR684b7qWFZPoDf5zyA6","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/Fqag5o95nYJ4wof9VgSJmN1RiR684b7qWFZPoDf5zyA6"}}}
