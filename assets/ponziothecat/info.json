{"name":"PonzioTheCat","id":"ponziothecat","symbol":"ponzio","description":"Meet Ponzio the Cat ($PONZIO), a unique creation flaunting wealth and indifference. Ponzio has burned over 50 ETH in liquidity for amusement, showcasing his lavish nature. The financial mechanism he designed ensures $PONZIO's rapid rise: every four days, the token supply is halved, accelerating value growth far beyond Bitcoin's four-year halving cycle. This mechanism subtly reduces the supply every 34 minutes, driving prices up. Investors in $PONZIO, who contribute to the liquidity pool and stake their tokens, are rewarded with an additional 13.37% in debased tokens every four days. This continuous value addition increases the total value locked (TVL) as more participants join.","links":"https://ponzio.io","market_cap":962302,"market_cap_rank":2781,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ponziothecat/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x873259322be8e50d80a4b868d186cc5ab148543a"}}}
