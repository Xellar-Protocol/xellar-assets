{"name":"TUNA","id":"tuna_solana","symbol":"tuna","description":"Tuna.fun is a Solana-based meme coin launchpad designed for seamless creation, discovery, and trading of community-driven tokens. Anyone can launch a token effortlessly, with high creator rewards, making it highly accessible for fun, speculative meme projects. The platform utilizes a bonding curve mechanism: token prices start low and rise progressively as users buy with SOL. Real-time tracking shows bonding progress, and once it reaches 100%, liquidity automatically migrates to a decentralized exchange (DEX) like Raydium, enabling broader trading. Users can explore trending tokens sorted by market cap, monitor recent purchases, and engage with popular themes such as $TUNA variants, $CORG, $WOJAK, and other viral meme coins. Tuna.fun prioritizes speed, low costs, and early-stage speculation in the volatile Solana meme ecosystem, fostering rapid community growth and high-risk, high-reward opportunities.","links":"https://tuna.fun","market_cap":583049,"market_cap_rank":4519,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/tuna_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"GfLD9EQn7A1UjopYVJ8aUUjHQhX14dwFf8oBWKW8pump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/GfLD9EQn7A1UjopYVJ8aUUjHQhX14dwFf8oBWKW8pump"}},"is_native":false}
