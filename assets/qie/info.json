{"name":"QI Blockchain","id":"qie","symbol":"qie","description":"Why QIE is the Blockchain Worth Building On — And Owning QIE isn’t just another blockchain. It’s a complete, high-performance Layer 1 system—engineered from the ground up for real-world usability, developer freedom, and long-term economic sustainability. Every design choice reflects one goal: to create a blockchain that works for builders, users, and investors alike. Fast, Final, and Fair by Design Consensus in QIE is powered by Delegated Proof of Stake (dPoS) with Tendermint Core, combining speed and security like few others. Transactions settle in 1 second, with instant finality—meaning no reorg risks or delays. This isn’t probabilistic guesswork; it’s mathematically certain. Validators must perform. If they double-sign, go offline, or manipulate transactions—they’re penalized. And delegators, everyday users like you, help secure the network by choosing which validators to support. Everyone earns rewards. Everyone shares responsibility. EVM-Compatible. Cosmos-Ready. No Limits. QIE speaks Solidity—so developers familiar with Ethereum can migrate instantly and launch dApps without new tooling. But it goes further. Built on Cosmos SDK, QIE is IBC-ready, enabling seamless communication with other IBC chains. This makes QIE a bridge between ecosystems—not just a siloed blockchain. No Layer 2s. No bridges. No gimmicks. Just one fast, cheap, composable base layer. Economic Model That Actually Works Most projects inflate endlessly. QIE does the opposite. • 80% of all transaction fees are burned, permanently reducing supply. • 55,000 coins/month are emitted today (July 2025), dropping by half every two years. • Max supply is hard-capped at 150 million, but due to burning, that will never be reached. And yes, unlike fiat currencies or inflated meme coins, QIE is deflationary by nature—designed to protect long-term value and wealth. Community Governance, Not Closed Committees Every upgrade, economic change, and policy shift on QIE is done on-chain, transparently. Anyone can submit a proposal. Anyone who holds QIE can vote. Want to change the halving cycle? Propose it. Want to increase validator rewards? Vote for it. Want to fund a public goods initiative? Start a proposal. QIE puts decision-making where it belongs: in the hands of its users. Get Involved — Whether You’re a Developer, Validator, or Curious Investor • Become a Validator – No minimum QIE required.
