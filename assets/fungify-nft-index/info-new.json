{"name":"Fungify NFT Index","id":"fungify-nft-index","symbol":"nft","description":"The $NFT Protocol facilitates a permissionless, exchange-traded fund (ETF) mechanism for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It operates through a vault system where NFTs are deposited and a corresponding $NFT token is minted, representing the value of the NFTs within the vault. The $NFT token can be traded in the open market, and its value is pegged to the collective floor prices of the NFTs in the vault.","links":"https://fungify.it","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/fungify-nft-index/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x4268a135840e5273e9dcb3dc78303767d3964f43"}}}
