{"name":"WizoLayer","id":"wizolayer","symbol":"wizo","description":"WizoLayer is a community-powered mining and rewards protocol built on the Base Network. It transforms the way users participate in decentralized ecosystems by enabling on-chain mining, activity-based rewards, and a multi-tier referral system. Unlike traditional projects, WizoLayer combines gamified mining, sustainable tokenomics, and community-first governance to ensure long-term growth. By focusing on fairness and accessibility, it allows every participant to contribute and earn through tasks, referrals, and staking. With upcoming products like WizoQuest and the WizoLayer Mobile App, the project is positioned to evolve into a complete ecosystem blending DeFi, mining, and community engagement into one powerful platform.","links":"https://wizolayer.app/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wizolayer/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
