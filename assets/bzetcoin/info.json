{"name":"BzetCoin","id":"bzetcoin","symbol":"bzet","description":"What is the project about? While BzetCOIN operates on the same principle as Bitcoin, there are some differences between them. It was created to address some of the flaws in the Bitcoin system and has been successful in doing so. BzetCOIN is a cryptocurrency that operates on an open-source blockchain system, which is part of the BzetMex ecosystem. It was created to enable money transfers at very low costs. Unlike the Bitcoin blockchain, BzetCOIN's blockchain system creates blocks faster, which enables faster transaction confirmations for BzetCOIN. What makes your project unique? Although Bzetcoin utilizes the same underlying system as other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, it offers some advantages compared to other crypto values. BzetCOIN was created by being inspired by Bitcoin's open-source software, but it uses a different algorithm. This algorithm makes block transactions easier to perform and keeps system requirements to a minimum. This advantage in block transactions significantly reduces transaction confirmation times and greatly affects transaction speeds. History of your project. Our project is just starting. It will go on pre-sale on April 6, 2023. Whatâ€™s next for your project? Our project provides independent easy coin transfer thanks to android and iOS mobile wallets. It helps payment technologies thanks to the system adaptable to pos devices. What can your token be used for? With its unique features, it can also be used as a means of payment, and with the right ecosystem management, it will be a successful coin.","links":"https://bzetcoin.com","market_cap":429565,"market_cap_rank":3163,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bzetcoin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
