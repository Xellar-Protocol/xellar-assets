{"name":"COINDEPO","id":"coindepo_ethereum","symbol":"coindepo","description":"CoinDepo is a decentralized finance platform that merges high-yield deposit accounts with instant crypto lending, giving users the chance to earn passive income while maintaining liquidity. By depositing cryptocurrencies or stablecoins, users can earn up to 24% APR with daily compounding and no strict lock-up requirements, making the product flexible compared to traditional staking. At the heart of the ecosystem is the COINDEPO token (CDP), which supports platform rewards, governance opportunities, and a unique charitable component, as 3% of the total supply is automatically allocated to social causes through its smart contract. This combination positions CoinDepo as both a profit-oriented and socially responsible project within the DeFi industry.","links":"https://coindepo.com/token","market_cap":1379825,"market_cap_rank":3372,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/coindepo/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb40725714fe8c547c5b0c1472cba3554efa81718","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xb40725714fe8c547c5b0c1472cba3554efa81718"}},"is_native":false}
