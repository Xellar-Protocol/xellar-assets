{"name":"Dynex","id":"dynex_ethereum","symbol":"dnx","description":"Dynex is a DePIN platform for neuromorphic quantum computing, based on an innovative new blockchain protocol. It consists of participating Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) miners that constitute a decentralised n.quantum computing network which is capable of computing quantum computing algorithms, featuring quantum-entanglement and -tunnelling effects, at scale. Without the limitations of traditional quantum computing, it can solve real-world problems, made possible with our proprietary algorithm DynexSolve. All this is wrapped in a sustainable and long term business model.","links":"https://dynexcoin.org/","market_cap":2776888,"market_cap_rank":2619,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dynex_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x9928a8600d14ac22c0be1e8d58909834d7ceaf13","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x9928a8600d14ac22c0be1e8d58909834d7ceaf13"}},"is_native":false}
