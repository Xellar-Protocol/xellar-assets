{"name":"WABA","id":"waba_ethereum","symbol":"waba","description":"WABA is a Layer-1 energy blockchain transforming grids into intelligent, incentive-driven networks to accelerate breakthroughs in robotics and AI. Using Proof-of-Consumption (Proof of Non Work), participants earn and mine the WABA token by operating WABA DePIN devices or completing verified demand-response tasks within the ecosystem. Instead of rewarding raw compute, WABA rewards verified reduction or reshaping of energy use. Turning down at the right time is the “work.” That flips mining into a real-world service.","links":"https://www.wabanetwork.org/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/waba_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xbc53e54ee9b39d6347e49566ea0edaf1da107288","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xbc53e54ee9b39d6347e49566ea0edaf1da107288"}},"is_native":false}
