{"name":"Evolva","id":"evolva","symbol":"eva","description":"Evolva Token (EVA) is a forward-thinking cryptocurrency operating on the BEP20 standard, contributing to the evolution of decentralized finance (DeFi). The project's foundation is rooted in a commitment to providing users with a reliable and efficient blockchain experience, focusing on practical applications rather than extravagant claims. At its core, Evolva Token seeks to overcome common challenges faced by existing cryptocurrencies, such as scalability and fee stability. The platform employs a robust Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism named Nightshade, which is designed to enhance scalability without compromising on security. One of the primary utilities of EVA is its role in facilitating transactions within the Evolva ecosystem. Users transacting on the platform incur fees in EVA, providing a seamless and efficient method for value exchange. Additionally, EVA serves as the lifeblood of the network by empowering validator nodes through staking, contributing to the overall security and decentralization of the network. Governance plays a pivotal role in the evolution of the Evolva ecosystem. EVA holders actively participate in governance votes, influencing decisions related to resource allocation within the network. This democratic approach ensures that the community has a voice in shaping the future of Evolva, fostering a sense of inclusivity and shared responsibility. Evolva Token, in its essence, is not positioning itself as a revolutionary or groundbreaking solution. Instead, it acknowledges the iterative nature of the blockchain space, building upon existing frameworks to address practical challenges faced by users.","links":"https://evolva.io","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/evolva/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6c2c232ead0d384c4dcb1f5d3ee80ffe5ba32ec9"}}}
