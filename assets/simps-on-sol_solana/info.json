{"name":"SIMPS ON SOL","id":"simps-on-sol_solana","symbol":"simp","description":"Who is Homer Simp? Meet Homer Simp — the face of glorious, chaotic, meme-fueled trading. He's yellow. He's poor. He's always drooling. And yet… somehow, he wins. Homer Simp isn't your average crypto degen — he's worse. He buys tops, sells bottoms, and thinks red candles mean \"fire sale.\" His wallet's a graveyard of rugs and false hope… But every now and then, this clueless simp stumbles into a 100x, chest bumps his monitor, and calls it \"a calculated play.\" And that, friends, is exactly the energy $SIMP was built on. What is $SIMP? $SIMP is a memecoin for the hopelessly hopeful. It's for the chart-riders with no TA, no plan, and way too much conviction. It's a tribute to the lucky few who trade like it's a casino — and still walk away with the chips. Powered by the community and held together with Copium, $SIMP embraces: Luck over logic Memes over metrics Drawdowns over discipline Why $SIMP Wins (Eventually) Just like Homer Simp himself, this coin shouldn't work… But because it's so dumb, it's brilliant. You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll probably question your decisions. But most importantly: You'll be early to the greatest $SIMPlication of wealth the crypto world's ever seen.","links":"https://simpsonsol.xyz","market_cap":5711.49,"market_cap_rank":12173,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/simps-on-sol_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"B39SX6An7SE3BEj6wq9k8eeZNAgERNgoT8U7a6EJPUMp","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/B39SX6An7SE3BEj6wq9k8eeZNAgERNgoT8U7a6EJPUMp"}},"is_native":false}
