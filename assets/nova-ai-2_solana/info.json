{"name":"NOVA AI","id":"nova-ai-2_solana","symbol":"nova","description":"NOVA AI Detector is an advanced browser extension designed to protect Web3/Solana ecosystem users from the most common yet dangerous risks: phishing, malicious contracts, compromised wallets, and sophisticated scams that evolve daily. Unlike passive solutions or incomplete tools, NOVA acts as a true digital shield, working in the background while the user browses, analyzes, or interacts with any site, contract, or address on the blockchain. Its modular design allows for intelligent scanning of websites, smart contracts, and wallets, providing contextual alerts based on real-world on-chain behavior and threat patterns. Thanks to its user-centric approach, no technical expertise is needed to understand the risks: NOVA simplifies complexity, automates protection, and empowers users with clear explanations and intuitive features. Its integration with AI specifically trained in Web3 security, along with an active community that can report and receive rewards for threats, makes NOVA much more than an extension: it's a constantly evolving, intelligent cybersecurity agent.","links":"https://www.nova.galaxyhub.ai/","market_cap":204952,"market_cap_rank":5879,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nova-ai-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"AfLh3wndb2yHQWJZFSjyncvRDDyU8DQPcGbY1eiABdev","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/AfLh3wndb2yHQWJZFSjyncvRDDyU8DQPcGbY1eiABdev"}},"is_native":false}
