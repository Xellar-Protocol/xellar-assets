MGH is engaged in populating & monetizing LANDs, building games on them and creating unique experiences for communities around the globe. MGH solves multiple problems the NFT and Metaverse space is currently facing by: * A valuation algorithm to estimate the fair price of Metaverse LANDs combined with a user-friendly interface to evaluate LANDs * Creating state-of-the-art metaverse experiences in form of community hubs, games, events and more... * Offering the dcl-editor that makes building in Decentraland a children’s game * A Chainlink Oracle to push valuation data on-chain MGH is the native utility token of the DAO and it is used... * as a medium of exchange for services within MGH’s ecosystem * for staking linked to revenue-backed network rewards * to participate in the governance of the MGH DAO How does MGH's token model work? MGH has a long-term revenue-backed burning and staking model which rewards token holders and stakers due to its deflationary nature. When a user pays for services and experiences using $MGH, 40% is burned and 60% distributed as staking rewards. When the user pays with other accepted currencies, 30% is distributed to the MGH treasury and the rest is swapped for MGH tokens (creating buying pressure) and subsequently burned and distributed as staking rewards.","links":"https://www.metagamehub.io/","market_cap":164125,"market_cap_rank":4011,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/metagamehub-dao/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8765b1a0eb57ca49be7eacd35b24a574d0203656"},"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc3c604f1943b8c619c5d65cd11a876e9c8edcf10"}}}
