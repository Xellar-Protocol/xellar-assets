{"name":"BIM","id":"bim","symbol":"bim","description":"Overview The BIM project represents an innovative initiative in the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem, aiming to bridge the gap between the traditional world and Web 3.0. Through a series of interconnected services, BIM aims to democratize access to blockchain technologies, while supporting the real economy. Origins The BIM project was born in August 2022, the fruit of an ambitious vision driven by LÃ©o Pestre and Damian Py. BIM's objective was clear from the outset: to create a complete ecosystem that facilitates the integration of blockchain into the real economy, while supporting the innovation and development of startups and SMEs. This vision was driven by the conviction that blockchain can be a powerful engine for reindustrialization and the valorization of know-how. BIM's pivot towards increasing decentralization marked a significant evolution in its strategy. The group broadened its horizons to develop a complete ecosystem centered around its governance token, BIM. This transformation has created an extensive range of services and utilities for the token, enriching its ecosystem.","links":"https://bim.finance/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bim/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":17,"contract_address":"0xe78649874bcdb7a9d1666e665f340723a0187482"}}}
