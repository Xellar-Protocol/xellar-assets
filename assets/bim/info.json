{"name":"BIM","id":"bim","symbol":"bim","description":"The BIM Token is the governance token for the team and its objectives. It is the central asset that links all BIM project stakeholders, in order to perpetuate the virtuous cycle of value creation around which BIM was invented. The token's usefulness is twofold: on the one hand, token holders have the right to vote on important governance decisions. Secondly, a portion of all revenues generated by the BIM Exchange protocol goes towards our incentive programs for token holders. Incentives are paid on a regular basis.","links":"https://bim.finance/","market_cap":36227139,"market_cap_rank":1094,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bim/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe78649874bcdb7a9d1666e665f340723a0187482"}}}
