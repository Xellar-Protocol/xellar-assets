{"name":"aSUGAR","id":"asugar","symbol":"asugar","description":"Jiko is a DeFi yield optimizer gamified as a PvP idle card game. Users stake in single-sided pools to earn yield while powering up their cards—whose stats scale with token and NFT prices. By integrating liquid staking, CDPs (collateralized debt positions), and gamification, Jiko transforms passive financial activities into a dynamic player-versus-player (PvP) experience. Built natively on Berachain, it introduces a new era where financial acumen and PvP strategy work hand-in-hand.","links":"https://app.beraji.com","market_cap":256037,"market_cap_rank":6071,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/asugar/logo.png","detail_platform":{"berachain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x804cf700de1e18f2411bd05aad5fa10d60e1900f","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/berachain/tokens/0x804cf700de1e18f2411bd05aad5fa10d60e1900f"}}}
