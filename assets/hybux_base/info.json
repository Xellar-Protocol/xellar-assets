{"name":"HYBUX","id":"hybux_base","symbol":"hybux","description":"HYTOPIA is the next evolution in user-generated gaming - an open, creator-first platform where anyone can build, share, and play instantly in their browser. Founded in 2021 by Temptranquil and ArkDev, HYTOPIA was born from a deep commitment to creative freedom. Before launching HYTOPIA, the founders helped empower Minecraft creators to build and sell digital assets. When Microsoft’s NFT policy ended that ecosystem, they set out to build a platform where creators could never lose ownership again. Today, HYTOPIA gives developers the tools to create multiplayer games in days (sometimes hours!) instead of weeks, using familiar web technologies like JavaScript and TypeScript. Its browser-native engine, live testing environment, and World Editor make building and publishing as easy as sharing a link. For players, there’s no friction - just click and play. With its creator-first economy, on-chain asset ownership, and higher earnings model, HYTOPIA is opening the door to a new era of digital creativity. Whether it’s cozy farming sims, racing games, or competitive PVP arenas, HYTOPIA’s growing community of developers is proving that the future of gaming belongs to the creators.
