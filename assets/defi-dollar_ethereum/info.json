{"name":"DeFi Dollar","id":"defi-dollar_ethereum","symbol":"usdfi","description":"DeFi needs more truly native, on-chain, and censorship-resistant stablecoins to fulfill its promise. That's why today, we are incredibly proud to launch DeFi Dollar. We’re further powering the Future of Finance by introducing $USDFI, an unstoppable stablecoin backed by the very tokens that govern DeFi itself. To start, DeFi Dollar is collateralized by ten of the most trusted and liquid assets on Ethereum: $AAVE, $CRV, $FXS, $LDO, $LINK, $LQTY, $SKY, $UNI, $WBTC, and $YFI. But we aren’t just using these assets as collateral; we are building upon the foundational blocks they represent, integrating with battle-tested protocols including Uniswap, Chainlink, Curve, Yearn, Frax, and Liquity to create a truly composable and resilient system.","links":"https://defidollar.io/","market_cap":339144,"market_cap_rank":5120,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/defi-dollar/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa0ed3359902eff692e5b8167038133a73d641909","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xa0ed3359902eff692e5b8167038133a73d641909"}},"is_native":false}
