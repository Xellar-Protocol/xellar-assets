{"name":"Etheism","id":"etheism","symbol":"e","description":"Etheism is an ERC-20 token with serial numbers that incorporates a unique feature: it embeds an SVG image of an 'Etheist Freak' directly within the tokenâ€™s transaction data. This image is generated using a mathematical formula inspired by DNA sequencing, evolving as the token supply decreases. Unlike standard ERC-721 tokens, which use separate protocols for storing images, Etheism integrates its image directly into the token itself. This approach establishes Etheism as a protocol distinct from traditional token standards.","links":"https://etheism.me","market_cap":53447,"market_cap_rank":6680,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/etheism/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xc0cfbe1602dd586349f60e4681bf4badca584ec9"}}}
