{"name":"YieldNest Restaked BNB","id":"yieldnest-restaked-bnb","symbol":"ynbnb","description":"ynBNB is a Liquid Restaking Token (LRT) developed to optimize yield from Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) by restaking. With ynBNB, users can maximize their returns by restaking staked BNB tokens, such as slisBNB, across leading restaking protocols like Kernel, Karak, and Binomial. ynBNB, built on vaults, will eventually rebalance to the highest-yielding restaking opportunities, keeping security and flexibility in mind.","links":"https://yieldnest.finance/","market_cap":223098,"market_cap_rank":4373,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/yieldnest-restaked-bnb/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x304b5845b9114182ecb4495be4c91a273b74b509"}}}
