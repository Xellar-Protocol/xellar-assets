{"name":"Kochi Ken","id":"kochi-ken","symbol":"kochi","description":"What is the project about? Kochi Ken, the brave wolfdog is on a mission to innovate and maximize the potential of tokens & NFTs. Kochi’s new TriFi Tokenomics shares 50% utility revenue with KOCHI token stakers. What makes your project unique? We coined the term “TriFi” to describe the three primary functions of Kochi Ken’s ecosystem – revenue sharing utilities, NFTs with utilities, and a memecoin. This groundbreaking revenue sharing model enables the Kochi Pack the opportunity to earn passive income from the success of our products and KOCHI’s token value. KOCHI is the fuel to the TriFi KochiKen ecosystem and your ticket to joining the Kochi Pack. Each token represents a share – the more KOCHI you stake, the higher your USDT dividends will be. KOCHI token stakers share 50% of Kochi’s ecosystem revenue. Both Kochi token & NFT stakers will also be granted raffle tickets to win upcoming KochiPad presale whitelists and access future real-time DeFi analytics. History of your project. What’s next for your project? Launchpad KOCHIPAD Kochipad, our flagship product, allows token projects to host presales on our platform with a very advantageous fee structure of not collecting tokens. This means we can’t negatively impact the chart through profit taking. Our business model is all about sharing. Out of all the fees collected, 50% will be going towards the team and 50% to Kochi token stakers. What can your token be used for? To get rewards from our launchpad.","links":"https://kochiken.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kochi-ken/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x41b2f7acc00035f9b1cec868b5054a6238c0a910"}}}
