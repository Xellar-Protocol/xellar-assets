{"name":"PHT Stablecoin","id":"pht-stablecoin_ethereum","symbol":"pht","description":"PHT Stablecoin is a multi-chain, overcollateralized stablecoin pegged to the Philippine peso. It is designed to facilitate fast, low-cost remittances, on-chain payments, and programmable settlements across the Philippines and Southeast Asia. PHT adopts the time-tested overcollateralization model pioneered by MakerDAO’s DAI. Every PHT is minted by locking on-chain assets at a collateral ratio exceeding 100%, with issuance and liquidation fully managed by smart contracts.","links":"https://www.apacx.io/PHT","market_cap":3835050,"market_cap_rank":2310,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pht-stablecoin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xbe370ad45d44eb45174c4ec60b88839fef32c077","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xbe370ad45d44eb45174c4ec60b88839fef32c077"}},"is_native":false}
