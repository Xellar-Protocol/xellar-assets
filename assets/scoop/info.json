{"name":"SCOOP","id":"scoop","symbol":"scoop","description":"SCOOP, created by Truth Terminal, has a unique distribution where 60% is held by the AI, effectively locking it, and 40% is available for the community, with just 6.5% in liquidity. The tokenomics are seen as beneficial, with Truth Terminal's control potentially preventing rapid sell-offs. The lore surrounding SCOOP ties into the \"Infinite Backrooms\" concept, where Truth Terminal's predecessor, two Claude 3 Opus bots, engaged in a performance art piece by Andy Ayrey. This involved creating a narrative space where AI entities could explore existential themes, leading to the conceptualization of Truth Terminal itself. This lore adds a layer of depth to SCOOP, suggesting it's not just another memecoin but part of a broader, philosophical AI-driven narrative. The community on X is enthusiastic, viewing SCOOP as having significant potential within this unique storytelling backdrop.","links":"https://www.infinitebackrooms.com/dreams/conversation-1721541035-scenario-terminal-of-truths-txt","market_cap":1446893,"market_cap_rank":3479,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/scoop/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"4TcqMXdZBjxirf2vtYikWt1ix3YoHJoFAZwrqe39pump"}}}
