{"name":"WrongCoin","id":"wrongcoin_solana","symbol":"wrong","description":"Wrongcoin ($WRONG) is a community-driven, meme-based cryptocurrency built on the Solana blockchain, embracing the absurdity of being the \"wrong\" choice in a market full of overhyped projects. It leans into humor, transparency, and community engagement, with no promises of utility beyond fostering a fun, ironic ecosystem. Wrongcoin doesn’t pretend to solve world hunger or revolutionize finance. It’s a self-aware experiment in community-driven absurdity, offering a refreshing break from overhyped crypto projects. By embracing its \"wrongness,\" it creates a unique niche for meme enthusiasts, crypto degens, and those who love a good laugh.","links":"https://thewrongcoin.vip","market_cap":4649.16,"market_cap_rank":12461,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wrongcoin_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"5B8jpiDY6WftBdwEyL3LWwYKeDSVikUpXoSYZhFxbonk","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/5B8jpiDY6WftBdwEyL3LWwYKeDSVikUpXoSYZhFxbonk"}},"is_native":false}
