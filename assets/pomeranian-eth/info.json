{"name":"Pomeranian ETH","id":"pomeranian-eth","symbol":"pom","description":"POMv2 is a layer1 EVM compatible solution, leveraging proof-of-stake (PoS) using Tendermint’s Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus algorithms. The native token of POMv2 is “POMv2”. Computations are performed by each node on the network for verifiability, security, and consensus purposes. Due to being a layer one solution, POMv2 Network is chain-agnostic and capable of interoperability with a range of networks using soon to be announced protocol. I want to prevent copycats from stealing my ideas. The underlying ledger of POMv2 is publicly visible; the native token POMv2 is used for DeFI, transactions, and gas fees.","links":"https://www.pomeranian.dev/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pomeranian-eth/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x24ffe459f51ea20c5d8ad49843529fc33654e7e4"}}}
