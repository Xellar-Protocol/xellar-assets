{"name":"Prima Donna","id":"prima-donna_base","symbol":"donna","description":"DONNA (Prima Donna) is a scientific research initiative focused on developing the world’s first therapeutic approach to regenerate natural tooth enamel. Led by researchers using stem-cell derived organoids, the project explores how to bioengineer enamel-forming cells and translate these findings into practical dental applications. The purpose of DONNA is to address enamel erosion, a condition affecting over 90% of people worldwide, by creating a regenerative solution where none currently exists. The DONNA IP Token (IPT) allows holders to participate in governance around the project’s intellectual property and research direction through Molecule's Protocol.","links":"https://molecule.xyz/ipts/donna","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/prima-donna/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x61527cd3667243b0a80d41cb690237444e42a8d0","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x61527cd3667243b0a80d41cb690237444e42a8d0"}},"is_native":false}
