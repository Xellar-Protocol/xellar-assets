{"name":"Kotanosuke (豆柴)","id":"kotanosuke_solana","symbol":"豆柴","description":"Meet Kotanosuke: cute and viral black Shiba Inu on the Solana Blockchain. In the rapidly evolving landscape of meme tokens and decentralized communities, few projects capture both virality and staying power. Launched via the BonkFun Launchpad, this project combines high memeability, strong community support, and viral appeal to position itself as a standout in the crypto ecosystem. What sets Kotanosuke apart is not only its unique branding and aesthetic — a striking black Shiba Inu — but also its social credibility and influence. Already recognized and followed by leading Solana-based personalities and projects such as Manyu, Bonk, and Momo. A passionate and organically formed community has rallied behind Kotanosuke. This is not just another meme token — it’s the beginning of a cultural movement. The community is driven, engaged, and focused on expanding the project’s awareness across Web3 platforms. The project’s ultimate ambition is clear: to become the “Shiba Runner” of the Bonk ecosystem. By leveraging Bonk’s established infrastructure, vibrant user base, and trusted brand presence, Kotanosuke aims to carve out a unique and lasting role within the Solana meme-token sphere. The term “Shiba Runner” encapsulates the idea of speed, agility, and viral momentum — qualities that align perfectly with the project’s vision and identity.","links":"https://x.com/kotanosuke_sol/status/1948399430379491598","market_cap":4989.7,"market_cap_rank":12371,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kotanosuke_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"SUBXNGpJq2kseayQihcqTjfc8EbT3W5iQwjXFQpbonk","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/SUBXNGpJq2kseayQihcqTjfc8EbT3W5iQwjXFQpbonk"}},"is_native":false}
