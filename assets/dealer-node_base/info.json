{"name":"Dealer Node","id":"dealer-node_base","symbol":"dnode","description":"Dealer Node is a decentralized ephemeral compute platform built on Base, allowing developers and AI agents to run code on-demand through on-chain micropayments. Instead of relying on traditional servers or fixed cloud costs, users submit a Docker image, pay only for execution time, and receive an isolated, private, disposable environment. The platform already integrates with the Base App and Farcaster MiniApp, offering a full dashboard for deployment monitoring. Dealer Node aims to become a new infrastructure layer for Web3 and AI-to-AI automation, delivering privacy, efficiency, and flexible compute for the next generation of applications.","links":"https://dealernode.app","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dealer-node/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa7f6e8a35d83228cc6c241c8dd0fb687552f75d1","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xa7f6e8a35d83228cc6c241c8dd0fb687552f75d1"}},"is_native":false}
