{"name":"Genit Chain","id":"genit-chain","symbol":"gnt","description":"Genit Chain is Blockchain L1 to relies on a system of PoA consensus that can support short block time and lower fees. The most bonded validator candidates of staking will become validators and produce blocks. The double-sign detection and other slashing logic guarantee security, stability, and chain finality. Improving the System Decentralized: Genit Chain is validated by thousands of nodes that operate independently of each other, ensuring your data remains secure and censorship resistant guarantee security, stability. Purpose: To create a highly scalable, energy-efficient, and decentralized blockchain platform that addresses the limitations of current blockchain technologies. To provide a secure and sustainable infrastructure for various applications, including those in finance, supply chain, gaming, and more. Function: Layer 1 Blockchain: Operates as a foundational blockchain network, enabling the development of decentralized applications and services. Proof-of-Authority Consensus: Relies on a system of trusted validators to secure the network and process transactions, ensuring efficiency and speed. Key Features: - Decentralization: Validated by thousands of independent nodes, promoting data security and censorship resistance. - Scalability: Designed to handle increasing transaction volumes without compromising performance. - Energy Efficiency: Prioritizes sustainability through eco-friendly approaches, reducing environmental impact. - High Security: Employs double-sign detection and slashing logic to safeguard the network. - Smart Interface: Offers a user-friendly interface for developers and users. - Acceleration: Focuses on speed and efficiency for transactions and processes. - Multi-Chain: Interacts with other blockchain networks for greater interoperability. - Maximizes Transactions and Control: Enables a high volume of transactions with user-controlled features.","links":"https://genitchain.org","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/genit-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x70d0a15410a1ab343551da57946a23e5d3ee8381"}}}
