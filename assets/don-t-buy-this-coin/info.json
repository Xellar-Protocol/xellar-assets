{"name":"Don't buy this coin","id":"don-t-buy-this-coin","symbol":"dbtc","description":"Don't buy this coin, it won't even load the logo. \"Don't Buy This Coin\" is a meme coin created for entertainment purposes on the Pumpfun site within the Solana network. It has no purpose or benefit. Ironically, its approach has been loved by people, and the fact that nearly 50% of the token's supply has been sent to and held by Binance makes it even more ironic. It aimed to become a cult meme coin.","links":"https://dontbuythis.co/","market_cap":33211,"market_cap_rank":8087,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/don-t-buy-this-coin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"BUAv6q4v5E2Pt5ms15uzxhFF1L6rXsG5i4NmSim9pump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/BUAv6q4v5E2Pt5ms15uzxhFF1L6rXsG5i4NmSim9pump"}}}
