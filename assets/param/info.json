{"name":"Param","id":"param","symbol":"param","description":"Param Token ($PARAM) powers a modular, interconnected Web3 gaming ecosystem developed by Param Labs. As the central utility token, $PARAM facilitates governance, ecosystem revenue sharing, and practical utility across the network. It serves as a payment method within the ecosystem, for example in Wager Matches, and is also used for gas fees across Param's network layers. Token holders benefit from exclusive discounts, staking rewards, and a voice in governance through a democratic voting mechanism. The token economics are designed to sustainably support and enhance the ecosystem's value, with a deflationary mechanism to promote long-term value appreciation. The ecosystem is geared towards revolutionizing gaming experiences by leveraging AI and blockchain technologies, uniting unique IPs within a vast gaming ecosystem.","links":"https://paramgaming.com/","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/param/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":null}}}
