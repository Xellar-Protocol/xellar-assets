Shutter is an encryption-as-a-service protocol, which makes simultaneous move situations fair by ensuring no participant can see another participant's move before making their own move. Shutter is working to implement encrypted mempools on Ethereum mainnet - which will prevent malicious MEV and real-time censorship. Shutter is also powering a range of applications, including: private voting, sealed bid auctions, pari-mutuel betting, sealed bounties.","links":"https://shutter.network","market_cap":1306513,"market_cap_rank":3426,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/shutter_optimistic-ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"optimistic-ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xaf1d71bf947709315655514467d5158e5d3046d5","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/optimism/tokens/0xaf1d71bf947709315655514467d5158e5d3046d5"}},"is_native":false}
