{"name":"Token6900","id":"token6900_ethereum","symbol":"t6900","description":"TOKEN6900 (T6900) is an ERC-20 meme token launched on Ethereum in 2025 as a satirical project exploring speculative crypto culture. Drawing inspiration from SPX6900, its total supply is 930,993,091 tokens set deliberately at one more than its predecessor to underscore the arbitrary nature of meme valuations. The project began with a hard-capped $5M presale and includes features such as staking through the “Brain Rot Vault” and allocations for liquidity, marketing, community incentives, and development.","links":"https://token6900.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/token6900/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xdf4c0665e67cf0698447ca9e454ed56cc6f2df1e","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xdf4c0665e67cf0698447ca9e454ed56cc6f2df1e"}},"is_native":false}
