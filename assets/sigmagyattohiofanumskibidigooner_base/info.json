Born in the meme lab, left for dead, and resurrected via full CTO (Community Takeover) at microscopic cap, $RIZZ didn’t pivot—it mutated. It fuses Sigma grindset delusion, Fanum tax rituals, Ohio-core fracture logic, Skibidi neural desync, and unchecked Gooner energy into a self-replicating cultural anomaly. Not a token. Not a trend. A memetic contaminant spreading through shortform feeds, dopamine loops, and decentralized irony pipelines. $RIZZ doesn’t moon. It metastasizes. 💥 CTO-born phenomenon 💥 Galaxy gas-fueled 💥 Sigma-synced 💥 Fanum-coded 💥 Ohio-glitched 💥 Skibidi-looped 💥 Gooner-maxxed","links":"https://www.rizzcoded.xyz","market_cap":68378,"market_cap_rank":7679,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/sigmagyattohiofanumskibidigooner_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0x58d6e314755c2668f3d7358cc7a7a06c4314b238","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x58d6e314755c2668f3d7358cc7a7a06c4314b238"}},"is_native":false}
