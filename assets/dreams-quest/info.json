The first game, Origins: The Fall of Azoria is in development schedule for early access in late 2022. Players find themselves in a fantastical world full of color, vibrancy and mystery, only to discover this paradise is quickly deteriorating. The player's goal is to resolve an evolving threat to Azoria and the other realms, through exploration, conflict and character development to restore the realms before itâ€™s too late. The game is an exclusive invitation mixed together with a unique challenge to travel to a place where we have only dreamed of, but now can experience. We live in a world we cannot control, and now players can cross through the portal which takes you to a world where your actions directly impact outcomes. Dreams Quest is a multi-stage game with the first chapter, Dreams Quest Origins, the Fall of Azoria, being the opening game that will allow players to experience the immersive game experience, to explore familiar landscapes and biomes, and to seek to understand what has happened to Azoria and what needs to be done to restore it.","links":"https://dreams.quest","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dreams-quest/logo.png"}
