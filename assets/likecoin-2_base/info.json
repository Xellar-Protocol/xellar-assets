{"name":"LikeCoin","id":"likecoin-2_base","symbol":"like","description":"LikeCoin is a DeBook protocol designed to revolutionize book publishing. LikeCoin empowers authors with immutable content metadata, persistent storage (IPFS/Arweave), and fairer revenue share, while readers become curators, stakeholders and may participate in governance. The core is the $LIKE token (ERC-20 on Base), which readers own and can stake on books to endorse them, influencing their ranking and discoverability. Also, $LIKE holders may participate in proposal voting directly or through delegates. Stakeholders of a book share in book sale income, aligning incentives between creators and consumers. This fosters a community-driven literary ecosystem where books, as NFTs, are co-curated and co-monetized.","links":"https://like.co/","market_cap":2124673,"market_cap_rank":2906,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/likecoin-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0x1ee5dd1794c28f559f94d2cc642bae62dc3be5cf","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x1ee5dd1794c28f559f94d2cc642bae62dc3be5cf"}},"is_native":false}
