{"name":"Hound","id":"hound","symbol":"hound","description":"Hound is the first lending and margin trading platform launching on Dogechain, bringing real yield. Being built on BentoBox Hound allows anyone to create customized and gas-efficient markets for lending, borrowing, and collateralizing a variety of DeFi tokens, stablecoins, and synthetic assets. Hound’s future broad diversity of tokens is supported through the use of a unique isolated market framework. Unlike traditional DeFi money markets where high-risk assets can introduce risk to the entire protocol, in Hound each market is entirely separate (similar to the SushiSwap DEX), meaning the risk of assets within one lending market has no effect on the risk of another lending market. And the best thing: Hound’s code is battle-tested and bulletproof, because, as mentioned before, it is based on Sushi’s BentoBox.","links":"https://www.houndfinance.xyz/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/hound/logo.png"}
