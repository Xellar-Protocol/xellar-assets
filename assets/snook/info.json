{"name":"Snook","id":"snook","symbol":"snk","description":"Snook is an online, multiplayer, \"Snake\"-like IO game. It's riding the fastest growing trend in this segment - the \"Play-to-earn\" NFT game. OK, so this is hot! Great. But, what is it? The player's snook-character in the game is a minted NFT. As the player advances in the game (by eating everything it can, avoiding and killing other snooks and taking their traits), she accrues achievements (e.g., traits and rare/difficult to get special skins). Blockchain and Crypto technologies make it possible for us to immutably record these achievements (think of it as a Blockchain/Crypto \"barrel\"). The game character/NFT can be accessed for future games or for commercial purposes, and under certain conditions provides financial incentives to the player.","links":"https://www.snook.gg/","market_cap":62597,"market_cap_rank":5144,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/snook/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x689f8e5913c158ffb5ac5aeb83b3c875f5d20309"}}}
