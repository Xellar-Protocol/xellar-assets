{"name":"LayerEdge","id":"edgen_ethereum","symbol":"edgen","description":"LayerEdge Network achieves unprecedented security through a multi-layered approach that combines Bitcoin's proven consensus mechanism with distributed verification. By anchoring to Bitcoin's blockchain while distributing verification across millions of lightweight nodes using edgenOS, LayerEdge creates a security model that is both robust and scalable. Our unique architecture ensures that no single point of failure exists, while zk cryptography mathematically guarantees computational integrity. This hybrid security model allows LayerEdge to maintain Bitcoin-grade security without inheriting its throughput limitations.","links":"https://www.layeredge.io/","market_cap":739161,"market_cap_rank":4106,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/edgen_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xaa9806c938836627ed1a41ae871c7e1889ae02ca","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xaa9806c938836627ed1a41ae871c7e1889ae02ca"}},"is_native":false}
