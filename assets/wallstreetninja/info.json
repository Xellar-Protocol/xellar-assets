{"name":"WallStreetNinja","id":"wallstreetninja","symbol":"wsn","description":"WallStreetNinja (WSN) is a complete decentralized accessibility solution, where users can access decentralized ecosystems of their choice, in a more simplistic manner, broadening accessibility and fostering mainstream adoption. We feel the barrier to adoption is the need to install browser extensions and smartphone wallet apps. In the fast paced world of decentralized ecosystems, who has time to install an app and learn how to use it? There are already a multitude of protocols and technologies available within the decentralized ecosystem, but largely inaccessible to the average person. Essentially we want to give people accessibility to existing infrastructure in a more user friendly fashion. Our solution is to provide an easy to use web application that does not require browser extensions or userside web3 plugins. Instead we intend to take advantage of APIs such as Pocket Network (blockchain relays), 1inch (trading) and Wallet Connect v2.","links":"https://ws.ninja","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wallstreetninja/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x7fa4cd8aeedcb8d36dbc5d856e3a1bee490d7b36"}}}
