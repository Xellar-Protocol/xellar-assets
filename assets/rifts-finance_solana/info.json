{"name":"Rifts Finance","id":"rifts-finance_solana","symbol":"rifts","description":"Rifts Protocol is a decentralized yield and liquidity infrastructure built on Solana. The protocol enables users to generate sustainable, non-inflationary yield by converting market volatility into fees through arbitrage and trading activity. Rifts allows the creation of fully collateralized Pools that wrap SPL tokens into synthetic assets (wTKNs), which represent 1:1 ownership of underlying assets. These wrapped tokens are programmable, tradable, and designed to drift from their peg, creating arbitrage-driven revenue for users and liquidity providers. The system avoids external oracles, using a self-updating pricing mechanism to reduce manipulation risks. Rifts includes single-asset vaults, multi-asset index vaults, and future lending layers that allow collaborative volatility farming. Fee structures, burn mechanics, and buybacks return value to token holders in a transparent and long-term manner.","links":"https://rifts.finance/","market_cap":2131006,"market_cap_rank":2901,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/rifts-finance_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"HjBMk5rABYdAvukYRvrScBnP9KnN9nLdKSbN2QPppump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/HjBMk5rABYdAvukYRvrScBnP9KnN9nLdKSbN2QPppump"}},"is_native":false}
