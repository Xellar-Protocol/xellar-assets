{"name":"Staked Tharwa USD","id":"staked-tharwa-usd_ethereum","symbol":"sthusd","description":"Holding stablecoins has historically meant sacrificing yield in exchange for stability. With sthUSD, that tradeoff disappears. sthUSD is a yield-bearing token that distributes returns from Tharwa’s real-world asset portfolio directly to users passively, transparently, and without the need to lock capital in high-risk strategies. It’s simple: hold thUSD, stake it to receive sthUSD, and earn real yield backed by diversified real-world assets. No auto-compounding loops. No farming gimmicks. Just actual returns from actual assets.","links":"https://tharwa.finance/","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/staked-tharwa-usd/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf7af0a8079f12f19533b0df69ce7ee6718b0c46f","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xf7af0a8079f12f19533b0df69ce7ee6718b0c46f"}},"is_native":false}
