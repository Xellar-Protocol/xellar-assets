{"name":"Ampleforth","id":"ampleforth_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"ampl","description":"Ampleforth is a digital-asset-protocol for smart commodity-money. The smart commodity money with a unique elastic supply protocol. AMPL supply expands and contracts in response to it’s price deviating from a 1 USD target. Deviations result in a supply change of AMPLs once every 24 hours, increasing or decreasing the number of tokens in each holder’s wallet pro-rata. Ampleforth is the only asset in the world with this elastic supply property, and therefore has counter-cyclical trading pressure and is uncorrelated with other digital assets such as Bitcoin.","links":"https://www.ampleforth.org/","market_cap":17328341,"market_cap_rank":1195,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ampleforth_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xdb021b1b247fe2f1fa57e0a87c748cc1e321f07f","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xdb021b1b247fe2f1fa57e0a87c748cc1e321f07f"}},"is_native":false}
