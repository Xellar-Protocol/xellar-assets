{"name":"CAT Terminal","id":"cat-terminal_solana","symbol":"cat","description":"The $CAT project is a community-led fusion of AI, crypto, and internet meme culture. At its core lies Cat-Terminal, an open-source AI framework originally created for voice and multimodal conversational agents. After being abandoned by its original developers, the project was revived by a passionate community who breathed new life into the technology, evolving it into a decentralized, self-sustaining multi-agent system. Through a spontaneous hackathon experiment, the AI framework developed a unique personality Meowthra the Unhinged, or simply “MEOW”an unpredictable, meme-obsessed digital feline. Powered by this chaotic energy, $CAT has become more than just a meme coin; it’s a movement to build an AI-driven metaverse where $CAT serves as the universal token, governed entirely by its community.","links":"https://x.com/CTO_Cats","market_cap":11849767,"market_cap_rank":1435,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cat-terminal/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"4HBQm2EhdpUWZkTYxttxNDnsoWi5beRAGWHpjVo8pump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/4HBQm2EhdpUWZkTYxttxNDnsoWi5beRAGWHpjVo8pump"}},"is_native":false}
