{"name":"Momento","id":"momento","symbol":"momento","description":"A DEFI+NFT project that aims to portray some of the most iconic and fascinating moments of the past decade that helps you to earn through the NFTs you buy. We have 2 broad categories of NFTs: a. General Category - Where we depict some of the most talked about moments of the past decade b. Cryptocurrencies - Where we depict the journey of some of the most prominent and upcoming cryptocurrencies. Through our NFTs, people will be able to earn through multiple forms. a. There is a 3% redistribution per transaction. So you earn just by holding. b. You can stake the NFTs you own with just a couple of clicks and start earning staking rewards c. The subsequent NFT sales get redistributed to the initial holders so more income from just holding the NFTs. There is a 10% tax per buy/sell: 3% - Liquidity (Increased the price floor over time) 3% - Redistributed to holders (Passive income) 4% - Buyback and burn (Anti-dump measure)","links":"https://momento.art/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/momento/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x0ae8b74cd2d566853715800c9927f879d6b76a37"},"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x1b9a8c4f2df5dc7b8744b1a170d8d727360c67ee"}}}
