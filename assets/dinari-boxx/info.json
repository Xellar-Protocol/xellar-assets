This exchange-traded fund seeks to replicate the returns of short-term U.S. Treasury bills using an options-based strategy known as a box spread, which involves simultaneously buying and selling options to create a risk-free return profile similar to Treasury bills. Each BOXX.d token is fully backed by a corresponding BOXX ETF share, securely held in a transparent and auditable treasury. By leveraging blockchain technology, BOXX.d provides investors with exposure to short-term, low-risk returns, while benefiting from 24/7 trading, fractional ownership, instant settlement, and enhanced liquidity.","links":"https://www.dinari.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dinari-boxx/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xcd3246f6173217dbecf63ffab83d477b266679da","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/arbitrum/tokens/0xcd3246f6173217dbecf63ffab83d477b266679da"},"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x088828f0a8e2dc8511e957230f4681371451fa1d","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x088828f0a8e2dc8511e957230f4681371451fa1d"},"blast":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe0ced15bc8ea1335bec573819f1813ffc5e38878","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/blast/tokens/0xe0ced15bc8ea1335bec573819f1813ffc5e38878"},"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa70cc6f267e02a6e135fa2589432e6734a613eb3","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xa70cc6f267e02a6e135fa2589432e6734a613eb3"}}}
