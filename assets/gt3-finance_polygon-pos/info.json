{"name":"GT3 Finance","id":"gt3-finance_polygon-pos","symbol":"gt3","description":"GT3 is the native token used in GT3.finance, a mobile-first DEX based on veTokens. Most of DEX and AMMs are designed to work on desktops. GT3 is designed to run perfectly on mobile devices, adding a new generation wallet (based on smart accounts & Passkeys) to simplify user experience. GT3 is also based on the concept of vote escrow tokens: users block our $GT3 native tokens and vote for their favourite pools, receiving Bribes from projects and increasing APR for liquidity pools.","links":"https://www.gt3.finance/","market_cap":4386915,"market_cap_rank":2186,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gt3-finance/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x06737d16ad9c1e41aa44fee2a952b26723b20673","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/polygon_pos/tokens/0x06737d16ad9c1e41aa44fee2a952b26723b20673"}},"is_native":false}
