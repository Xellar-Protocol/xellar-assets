{"name":"OMOM","id":"omom","symbol":"omom","description":"The OMOM project is a blockchain-based platform designed to digitalize physical assets, allowing individuals and institutions to convert tangible assets such as real estate, art, and precious metals into digital tokens. These tokenized assets can be easily bought, sold, or used for financing on the OMOM platform, thereby enhancing asset liquidity and providing investors with access to markets that were previously difficult to penetrate. Aimed at creating a transparent, efficient, and decentralized ecosystem for asset trading and management, OMOM leverages blockchain technology to address the challenges of poor liquidity and high market entry barriers associated with traditional assets.","links":"https://www.omomtoken.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/omom/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd93a10aaf86c18333e34e1c2eb628ef0d8215de0"}}}
