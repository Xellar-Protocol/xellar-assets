{"name":"Zunami Governance Token","id":"zunami-governance-token","symbol":"zun","description":"Zunami is a decentralized protocol that issues aggregated stablecoins, with their collateral utilized in omnipools and diversified across various profit-generating strategies. The entire income generated by the protocol, including the full yield from zunStables collateral and performance fees from Vaults, is distributed among ZUN stakers. These stakers manage strategies in Omni Pools or obtain zunStables liquidity from Vaults through DAO proposals. Additionally, ZUN stakers participate in a Gauge weight vote every two weeks to decide the distribution of ZUN token emissions.","links":"https://app.zunami.io/","market_cap":8928.19,"market_cap_rank":9680,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/zunami-governance-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6b5204b0be36771253cc38e88012e02b752f0f36","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x6b5204b0be36771253cc38e88012e02b752f0f36"},"optimistic-ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x25193034153afb4251a8e02a8db0deaef4c876f6","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/optimism/tokens/0x25193034153afb4251a8e02a8db0deaef4c876f6"},"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x346e74dc9935a9b02eb34fb84658a66010fa056d","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/arbitrum/tokens/0x346e74dc9935a9b02eb34fb84658a66010fa056d"},"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x1db0fc8933f545648b54a9ee4326209a9a259643","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x1db0fc8933f545648b54a9ee4326209a9a259643"}}}
