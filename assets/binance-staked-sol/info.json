{"name":"Binance Staked SOL","id":"binance-staked-sol","symbol":"bnsol","description":"Binance Staked SOL (BNSOL) represents your staked SOL plus the staking rewards received, in a tradable and transferable form. Ordinary staking would lock up your staked assets, which means you cannot use them for other purposes â€“ it increases a user's opportunity cost. In contrast, BNSOL provides flexibility to sell, transfer, or use the staked SOL position. You can even move BNSOL to a personal wallet and use it outside the Binance platform whilst still earning rewards. BNSOL accumulates staking rewards through the BNSOL:SOL conversion rate on Binance SOL Staking, even when it is used in other Binance products or external DeFi applications for additional yield opportunities.","links":"https://www.binance.com/en/solana-staking","market_cap":1282682610,"market_cap_rank":118,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/binance-staked-sol/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"BNso1VUJnh4zcfpZa6986Ea66P6TCp59hvtNJ8b1X85"}}}
