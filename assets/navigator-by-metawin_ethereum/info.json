{"name":"Navigator by MetaWin","id":"navigator-by-metawin_ethereum","symbol":"navi","description":"Navigator is a crash-style game with 0% house edge, designed so players capture the value instead of the house. The project’s purpose is to provide transparent, fair gameplay while rewarding activity through hourly leaderboards, daily prizes, and monthly airdrops. In addition, 1% of all wager volume is used to buy back NAVI tokens from the market, creating consistent demand. With 50% of the total supply allocated to the community, Navigator aligns token utility directly with player growth and activity.","links":"https://metawin.com","market_cap":928532,"market_cap_rank":3829,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/navigator-by-metawin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x86e1714dca461a66b24193cbc902515ddcb2d12c","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x86e1714dca461a66b24193cbc902515ddcb2d12c"}},"is_native":false}
