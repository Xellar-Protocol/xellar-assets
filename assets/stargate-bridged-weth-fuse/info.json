{"name":"Stargate Bridged WETH (Fuse)","id":"stargate-bridged-weth-fuse","symbol":"weth","description":"This is a Stargate version of WETH bridged to Fuse network. WETH is an ERC-20 token on Ethereum that represents 1 Ether (ETH). ETH is used to pay for transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. For example, swapping between cryptoassets on an Ethereum-based DEX will cost some small amount of ETH. The two main differences between WETH and ETH is that WETH cannot be used to pay for transactions and ETH is not an ERC-20 token. The next section will cover why there is a need to make an ERC-20 compatible version of ETH.","links":"https://fuse.io/","market_cap":264149,"market_cap_rank":6038,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/stargate-bridged-weth-fuse/logo.png","detail_platform":{"fuse":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x2f6f07cdcf3588944bf4c42ac74ff24bf56e7590","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/fuse/tokens/0x2f6f07cdcf3588944bf4c42ac74ff24bf56e7590"}}}
