Zero utility, but W I D E L Y integrated throughout the Berachain ecosystem. Henlo is more than just a memecoin; it’s the heartbeat of a new cultural wave on Berachain. By integrating with Berachain’s revolutionary Proof-of-Liquidity consensus model, Henlo turns every laugh, every meme, and every transaction into a part of the chain’s block rewards–making fun intrinsic to the ecosystem’s growth.","links":"http://henlo.com","market_cap":970791,"market_cap_rank":3681,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/henlo-3/logo.png","detail_platform":{"berachain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb2f776e9c1c926c4b2e54182fac058da9af0b6a5","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/berachain/tokens/0xb2f776e9c1c926c4b2e54182fac058da9af0b6a5"}}}
