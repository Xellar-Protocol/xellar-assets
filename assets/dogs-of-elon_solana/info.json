{"name":"Dogs of Elon","id":"dogs-of-elon_solana","symbol":"doe","description":"The Dogs of Elon (DOE) is a community take-over project. Rug-pulled twice by evil forces, these dogs of war refuse to give up. No more teams, no more rugs, just a community of loyal dogs working together. The DOE mission is simple - to Mars and beyond. Fuck the jeets... DOE relies on the community to push the narrative so join the DOE army and show us what you got. With a blue-tick OpenSea NFT collection and a community developed Web3 game ready to drop, these dogs cant be stopped.
