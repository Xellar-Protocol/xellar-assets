{"name":"Burncoin","id":"burncoin-2_solana","symbol":"burn","description":"Burncoin ($BURN) is a deflationary Solana-based meme coin with a fixed 21 million supply and no team, no insiders, and no inflation. Every swap and wallet transfer burns 4.20% of the tokens — permanently. Built using Solana Token Extensions, the burn is enforced on-chain by the protocol itself. Launched via a fair Dutch auction with no VC allocations, Burncoin is a community-owned token forged in the spirit of scarcity and decentralization — a fiery sibling to Bitcoin, but made to burn.","links":"https://getburncoin.com/","market_cap":224136,"market_cap_rank":5737,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/burncoin-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"GQe8DCQTBkuX5E2sjvwuKDZsjGYhU8k3DN5dkSbQLfqJ","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/GQe8DCQTBkuX5E2sjvwuKDZsjGYhU8k3DN5dkSbQLfqJ"}},"is_native":false}
