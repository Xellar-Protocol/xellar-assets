{"name":"NOTA","id":"nota","symbol":"usnota","description":"A digital token backed by fiat currency provides individuals and organizations with a robust and decentralized method of exchanging value while using a familiar accounting unit. The innovation of blockchains is an auditable and cryptographically secured global ledger. Asset-足backed token issuers and other market participants can take advantage of blockchain technology, along with embedded consensus systems, to transact in familiar, less volatile currencies and assets. In order to maintain accountability and to ensure stability in exchange price, we propose a method to maintain a one-足to-足one reserve ratio between a cryptocurrency token, called USNOTA, and its associated real足world asset, fiat currency. This method uses the XinFin Network (XDC) blockchain, Proof of Reserves, and other audit methods to prove that issued tokensare fully backed and reserved at all times.","links":"https://www.usnota.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nota/logo.png","detail_platform":{"xdc-network":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"xdcd04275e2fd2875beaade6a80b39a75d4fe267df6"}}}
