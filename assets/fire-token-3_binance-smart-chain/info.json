{"name":"Fire Token","id":"fire-token-3_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"fire","description":"Fire Token is a cryptocurrency that connects directly with Bitcoin mining to offer users exclusive earning opportunities. By staking tokens or NFTs, participants can receive Bitcoin mining rewards, distributed according to each member’s weighted contribution to the staking pool. This system enables everyone to take part in BTC mining and share in the generated rewards. The presale of the Fire Token started in November 2023 and ended in February 2024. The raised amount was invested in BTC mining equipment and activated shortly after. Overall, the project leverages Canada's low electricity rates of 0.065 cents per kWh to mine Bitcoin efficiently. The mission of FIRE is to give people to opportunity to share rewards earned from mining $BTC. Normally, buying and operating equipment on a smaller scale is hard and not worth it. Together we can scale to a big BTC mining farm and all rewards earned will be shared with NFT holders or token stakers.","links":"https://fire-token.ca","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/fire-token-3/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xed51083ad183e05ef2d9dfde1ad758c7384d652f","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0xed51083ad183e05ef2d9dfde1ad758c7384d652f"}},"is_native":false}
