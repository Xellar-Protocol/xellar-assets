{"name":"Chiva","id":"chiva-token","symbol":"chiv","description":"Chivatoken is the main token of our NFT Game Ecosystem Chivas Farming, a multiverse of interconnected multiplatform games supported by NFT technology, using the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network. It is a world exploration game based on digital creatures (Chivas), where the players own them, take care of them, have various confrontations and can trade them, becoming their true asset. Chivas are sold through our marketplace. In the different corrals, from the free to the most valuable, you will be able to play and win different types of rewards and even acquire different types of real assets. The game takes place in a world that is now known as CHIVAS FARMING, which was once a harmonious and lively place. Its ancient inhabitants misused resources and ended up releasing large doses of pollution and radiation, which brought death and destruction to their own end. The dying planet decided to be reborn, granting its elemental power to the only pure beings, who were free from the negative effects of living on the peaks of the high mountains, the Chivas. These creatures became special, they grew up unique, faster, stronger, and smarter. They inherited elements of nature and particular traits that allowed them to adapt, becoming the protectors of the new world, and capable of facing the old and new dangers that they may encounter.","links":"https://chivasfarming.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/chiva-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x9500e05ea02cc9cf3f904e83248b16e54e3e6e2e"}}}
