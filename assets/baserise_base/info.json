{"name":"BaseRise","id":"baserise_base","symbol":"brise","description":"BaseRise (BRISE) is a decentralized finance (DeFi) token built on the Base blockchain designed to integrate automatic buybacks and ecosystem growth into every transaction. The project introduces a dual-mechanism model where a portion of each trade funds token buybacks while another portion contributes to a growth fund. This structure aims to create sustainable demand pressure, reduce supply over time, and provide capital for marketing and ecosystem development, all within a transparent and community-governed framework.","links":"https://www.baserise.digital/","market_cap":9830.63,"market_cap_rank":11218,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/baserise/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xbcc7ff0361f659b1437001f9593e6d638b7dfc37","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xbcc7ff0361f659b1437001f9593e6d638b7dfc37"}},"is_native":false}
