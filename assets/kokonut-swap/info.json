Kokonut Swap is a next-generation AMM DEX protocol for the Polygon zkEVM ecosystem, powered by a dynamic-peg concentrated liquidity mechanism. What makes your project unique? Kokonut Swap is the only implementation of Curve v2's dynamic-peg concentrated liquidity algorithm in Solidity. What’s next for your project? We aim to grow liquidity on Kokonut Swap so that it can be the de facto DEX on Polygon zkEVM What can your token be used for? The KOKOS token is the governance token for the Kokonut Swap protocol. Users can stake KOKOS tokens to take part in Kokonut Swap’s decentralized governance and receive rewards.","links":"https://kokonutswap.finance","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kokonut-swap/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-zkevm":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf329bc8e21da7f278ce806e04c2266974edb1386"},"klay-token":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xcd670d77f3dcab82d43dff9bd2c4b87339fb3560"}}}
