RYO and the RYO Platform were developed to enhance online commerce, facilitate face- to-face and remote contactless payments, and to leverage certain existing and mass-market financial infrastructure such as ATMs and card processing systems. The blockchain, wallet, and server node technologies have already been developed and are in limited use by test users outside the Company.
