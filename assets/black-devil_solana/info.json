{"name":"Black Devil","id":"black-devil_solana","symbol":"anglerfish","description":"An anglerfish was spotted surfacing in Tenerife this week. This was reportedly the first time the six-inch deep-sea dweller had been observed so close to the surface. Unfortunately, the tiny \"sea devil\" didn't survive its ascent, but its brief appearance still left scientists in awe. A Community formed and made a tribute token. Different people with different skills have come together to make it what it is now.","links":"https://anglerfishsol.com/","market_cap":22082,"market_cap_rank":9589,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/black-devil/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"DjgujfEv2u2qz7PNuS6Ct7bctnxPFihfWE2zBpKZpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/DjgujfEv2u2qz7PNuS6Ct7bctnxPFihfWE2zBpKZpump"}},"is_native":false}
