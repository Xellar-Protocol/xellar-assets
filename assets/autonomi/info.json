{"name":"Autonomi","id":"autonomi","symbol":"ant","description":"Autonomi is a decentralised network where data is stored securely across millions of everyday devices, with privacy the default, not the exception. The Network is a fully decentralized ecosystem for data storage and retrieval. It does not require any single entity or service control as nodes are able to validate and engage (or ignore) one another without intervention. Unlike edge computing and others promoting private, decentralized hosting, The Autonomi Network is autonomous, permanent and has zero subscriptions or recurring fees. To use Autonomi a one-time upload fee is paid to The Network - the uploaded data is then quantum securely encrypted end to end. With Autonomi, everyday internet users, content creators and app developers will have access to a truly decentralized infrastructure layer - they’re going to be able to build, protect and deploy amazing things. With AI and Robotics changing our world fast, Autonomi will ensure each and everyone of us can be in control of our own knowledge, thoughts and actions.","links":"https://autonomi.com","market_cap":31956229,"market_cap_rank":885,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/autonomi/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa78d8321b20c4ef90ecd72f2588aa985a4bdb684"}}}
