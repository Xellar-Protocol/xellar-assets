{"name":"Ink Fantom","id":"ink-fantom","symbol":"ink","description":"\"The first cross-chain protocol allowing you to take your PAPER gains with you. Rather than being pegged to a native token, Paper is free to travel across all available chains at zero cost to you. No fee, no charge, no tax. Just the freedom to take your PAPER with you wherever you go in the blockchain. This cross-chain mobility will also allow you to take advantage of price differences across chains, and make even more gains from the arbitrage. Buy low, sell high has never been easier.\"","links":"https://printer.financial","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ink-fantom/logo.png"}
