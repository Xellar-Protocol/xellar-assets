{"name":"ARTE","id":"arte","symbol":"arte","description":"$ARTE is a utility token with a buyback-and-burn mechanism (we are using 5% of ArtPunks royalties to burn $ARTE), as well as multiple utilities related to the ArtPunks NFT collection. With $ARTE, holders will be able to: -Upgrade their ArtPunks NFT via the ‘Restoration’ system. -Purchase ArtPunks Paint Palettes to change the painting style of ArtPunks. -Enter lotteries for physical works of art as well as NFTs. -Purchase subscriptions to an educational virtual art gallery. -Use it to create \"\"Landscape NFTs\"\" - low supply, upgradeable, gamified NFTs. In short, the $ARTE token will be the fuel of the ArtPunks ecosystem - in all of the above utilities, used $ARTE will be burned - reducing its supply and increasing its value!
