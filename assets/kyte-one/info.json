{"name":"Kyte.One","id":"kyte-one","symbol":"kte","description":"In the current blockchain world, the growth hacking activities for crypto are difficult to conduct, and those that are somehow managed end up being a bot-fest & this ultimately causes huge losses to startups & the community alike. Events like airdrops, giveaways are raided by bots and there is an unfair distribution of prizes that ultimately diminishes all interest of participants in these giveaways. In addition to this, there is currently no option for rewarding users on dynamic activities that are being performed by the users on the organization's website, causing lesser and lesser conversions, and hence most of the users liquidate their tokens. In short, there is currently no easy option for achieving dynamic engagement via marketing methodologies and having legit participation in the blockchain world. AIRLYFT by Kyte.One: This is the problem we are trying to solve with our flagship product, AirLyft that aims to provide a one-stop solution for all the growth hacking needs for a crypto startup where each organization can create an event and let AirLyft do the maximum for them. It will be a platform where startups can run customized events on social channels & their own apps, distribute rewards on-chain, organize Giveaways, Quizzes, and Competitions. They can also Integrate their SMART CONTRACTS for dynamic rewards based on tasks a user performs on their website as well as on other social media platforms. This helps startups establish, engage & manage their community with a breeze.\"","links":"https://www.kyte.one/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kyte-one/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x61fa01129ac0bb124d1c60dc9f735c6c579a858b"},"avalanche":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x056d114ff1e01de3bca30f0efa3655df42880e5b"}}}
