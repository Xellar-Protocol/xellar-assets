{"name":"Muon","id":"muon_avalanche","symbol":"muon","description":"Muon is a decentralized, general-purpose validation layer for Web3. It enables dApps to run off-chain micro-validators (MuonApps) that process, validate, and sign data before pushing it on-chain. With a modular architecture secured by Threshold Signature Schemes (TSS), Shield Nodes, and EigenLayer, Muon powers scalable, trustless applications like oracles, bridges, and verifiable randomness tools.","links":"https://www.muon.net/","market_cap":106829,"market_cap_rank":6884,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/muon/logo.png","detail_platform":{"avalanche":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x6b1ecf0c181afff3d7096b26c3d2bc31f55ceab9","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/avax/tokens/0x6b1ecf0c181afff3d7096b26c3d2bc31f55ceab9"}},"is_native":false}
