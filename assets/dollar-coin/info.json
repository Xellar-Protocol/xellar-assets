{"name":"Dollar Coin","id":"dollar-coin","symbol":"dc","description":"Dollar Coin ($DC) is a community-driven meme project born out of satire — but backed by a powerful truth: fiat currency is broken. With over 40% of all USD printed in the last few years, inflation has become a global joke. Dollar Coin flips that joke on its head.
