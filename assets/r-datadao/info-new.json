{"name":"r/DataDAO","id":"r-datadao","symbol":"rdat","description":"r/DataDAO is a community owned project, we first launched with an airdrop where users uploaded their Reddit data to our platform and received RDAT tokens in exchange. Our goal is to monetize this data and pass on the proceeds to the DAO members who provided their data. Currently we have used the data to develop our own language model which will be deployed in the coming weeks by Ora protocol. We have no central authority and governance belongs 100% to the token holders.","links":"https://rdatadao.org","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/r-datadao/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x4498cd8ba045e00673402353f5a4347562707e7d"}}}
