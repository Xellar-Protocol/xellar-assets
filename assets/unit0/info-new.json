{"name":"Unit0","id":"unit0","symbol":"unit0","description":"UNIT0 addresses the challenge of blockchain scalability by creating Layer 2 (L2) networks that utilize the existing consensus of Layer 1 (L1) to process transactions more efficiently. This setup reduces the complexity typically associated with independent L2 consensus mechanisms, as L1 handles the primary validation. The network also enables cross-layer data and asset transfers, fostering an interconnected, scalable ecosystem. This design minimizes redundancy, cuts operational costs, and improves speed, making it ideal for high-traffic or resource-intensive blockchain applications. Additionally, it lays the groundwork for future integrations, such as Zero-Knowledge Proofs, to further enhance verification and security across networks.","links":"https://units.network/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/unit0/logo.png","detail_platform":{"waves":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"GjwAHMjqWzYR4LgoNy91CxUKAGJN79h2hseZoae4nU8t"},"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x48b847cf774a5710f36f594b11fc10e2e59bba72"}}}
