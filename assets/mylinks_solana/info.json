{"name":"MyLinks","id":"mylinks_solana","symbol":"link","description":"MyLinks is a Web3 link-in-bio platform built on Solana. It allows users to create customizable, token-gated personal pages where they can share links, social media, and premium content. Users can connect their wallets with one click, rearrange links easily, and even monetize their content through paid links or hidden premium access. Our goal is to make Web3 onboarding simple by giving creators, projects, and communities an easy tool to showcase their presence while integrating Solana-native features such as micro-payments, token gating, and Jupiter swap modules.","links":"https://mylinks.fun/","market_cap":2640.79,"market_cap_rank":12976,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mylinks/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"A7qn22uQNpUHWmSk5GY5N4vmVJ4uPUzGySegdkm1pump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/A7qn22uQNpUHWmSk5GY5N4vmVJ4uPUzGySegdkm1pump"}},"is_native":false}
