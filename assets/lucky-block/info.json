{"name":"Lucky Block","id":"lucky-block","symbol":"lblock","description":"The internet has created a demand for online gambling, with companies offering easily accessible online wagering. So, itâ€™s hardly surprising these websites are fast-growing and highly profitable. Lucky Block envisions a worldwide lottery with players using Blockchain Protocols, operating on the Binance smart chain. We believe the lottery should not be bound geographically or tied to local financial systems. Instead, our focus is to develop further transparency and fairness in gaming, creating a lottery where every player has better win odds while providing a solid investment strategy for token holders while contributing to the community. LBLOCK is available to buy on a growing number of decentralised and centralised exchanges including Pancakeswap and Lbank. Futher CEX lisitings pending with updates provided in the offical Lucky Block Telegram.","links":"https://luckyblock.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/lucky-block/logo.png"}
