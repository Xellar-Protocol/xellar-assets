{"name":"0L Network","id":"libra-3","symbol":"libra","description":"Libra Coin is a fork from Facebook's Diem (Libra) blockchain that was announced in 2019. Libra Coin operates on its own high-performance Layer 1 blockchain, known as the 0L Network. In October 2021, Libra Coin began mining. Like Bitcoin, there were no pre-mined coins or dedicated token allocation to any parties; all coins were minted through a mining process. Unlike Bitcoin, which undergoes continuous issuance, Libra Coin has a fixed supply. By December 2023, all the Libra Coin had been issued, establishing a capped supply and making the coin permanently deflationary. Fiercely independent, the project has a long-term view because it is unburdened by venture capital funding, \"labs\" entities, a foundation, and the influence of other blockchain ecosystems. Carpe diem.","links":"https://0l.network/","market_cap":2884258,"market_cap_rank":2049,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/libra-3/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""},"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x01edbffa4f61404458e22ff45deffef1c62228b5"}}}
