{"name":"Aristo","id":"aristo_solana","symbol":"aristo","description":"$ARISTO is a philosophical meme token that explores the metaphysical idea of emptiness, as described by thinkers like Aristotle and Plato. It challenges the notion that the void is mere absence, instead presenting it as pure potential. Drawing inspiration from the Japanese concept of ma — the space between things that gives them meaning — $ARISTO invites holders to reflect, pause, and find value in the undefined. It’s not just a token; it’s a symbol of intentional presence in a world of noise.","links":"https://aristocoin.org","market_cap":277395,"market_cap_rank":5442,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/aristo_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"HZXyLwwoxWHnnxfwFnQSTTBs3ys1xJsTQG8CzhUnzray","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/HZXyLwwoxWHnnxfwFnQSTTBs3ys1xJsTQG8CzhUnzray"}},"is_native":false}
