{"name":"Coin on Solana","id":"coin-on-solana","symbol":"coin","description":"$COIN is a decentralized digital currency project positioned as a community-driven, anti-establishment movement rather than a traditional financial asset. The core purpose of the project is to challenge and disintermediate established financial systems and \"middlemen.\" Its ethos is rooted in decentralization, operating without a formal corporate structure, board of directors, or IPO process, suggesting a community-owned and governed model. The project's function appears to be that of a \"memecoin,\" where its value and utility are derived from community sentiment, collective action, and viral marketing. The $COIN token serves as a symbol of participation in this \"hostile takeover\" of conventional finance, making it primarily a speculative asset for individuals who align with its disruptive and decentralized ideology.","links":"https://coinonsol.io","market_cap":15248.77,"market_cap_rank":10345,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/coin-on-solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"6CzvM95SQABhdjX4taXdpXYArz5daqcin4iM7CGjNwmW","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/6CzvM95SQABhdjX4taXdpXYArz5daqcin4iM7CGjNwmW"}}}
