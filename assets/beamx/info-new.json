{"name":"BEAMX","id":"beamx","symbol":"beamx","description":"Our goal is to make the Beam ecosystem as decentralized as possible, giving the stakeholders full control over the protocol governance. We foster a global community of researchers, developers and activists to maintain, develop and promote Beam and financial privacy in general. Stakeholders can vote on all aspects of the ecosystem through ownership of the BeamX governance token. Voters are incentivized to vote; their choices, identity and holdings are completely private.","links":"https://www.beamxdao.org/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/beamx/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
