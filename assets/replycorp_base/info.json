{"name":"ReplyCorp","id":"replycorp_base","symbol":"reply","description":"ReplyCorp turns social media posts into viral storefronts, onboarding experiences, and more through AI-powered flows right in the comments, not only avoiding the need to immediately direct users to a website, but virally marketing the posts with every interaction. ReplyCorp puts fully functional applications directly onto every major social media platform, with social media scrollers instantly becoming app users when they interact- using comments, likes, and shares as the interface. Behind the scenes, those actions connect back to an external database to read and write information, to enable functionality like checking product inventory for a checkout flow in a post, prompting AI models when a user is interacting with an AI app through comments, and adding rewards to a user’s account so that it’s waiting for them when they continue the interaction on the separate app or website. These are apps with the virality of memes, natively inside major social media platforms where 5.5B users already are.","links":"https://www.replycorp.io/","market_cap":1207072,"market_cap_rank":3526,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/replycorp/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x05b1266ddcee093ce060dbf697e230ea9b453633","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x05b1266ddcee093ce060dbf697e230ea9b453633"}},"is_native":false}
