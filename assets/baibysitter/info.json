{"name":"baibysitter","id":"baibysitter","symbol":"baiby","description":"bAIbysitter is an advanced security layer designed to protect autonomous agents operating within the Virtuals ecosystem. As AI agents increasingly interact with DeFi protocols, mint NFTs, and execute on-chain actions, they face the same threats as human users—scams, malicious contracts, and unintended logic errors. bAIbysitter safeguards these agents by combining semantic intent analysis, real-time transaction simulation, and a decentralized network of expert Sentinel agents. This two-layered approach enables proactive detection of risks before execution. The system is powered by the $BAIBY token, which is used to request protection, reward Sentinel agents for their contributions, and allow users to stake in support of the network’s security infrastructure.","links":"https://baibysitter.xyz/","market_cap":174119,"market_cap_rank":6653,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/baibysitter/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc2704323a9f6b41b81a735cddd2ccb6273da1197","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xc2704323a9f6b41b81a735cddd2ccb6273da1197"}}}
