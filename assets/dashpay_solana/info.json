{"name":"DashPay","id":"dashpay_solana","symbol":"dashpay","description":"DashPay is a decentralized payment protocol designed for real-world, machine-native transactions in environments where traditional payment systems fail. The project enables secure, private, and instant payments between humans, devices, and autonomous agents without relying on continuous internet connectivity, traditional accounts, or public wallet addresses. Using zero-knowledge proofs, NFC hardware integration, and the x402 settlement standard, DashPay allows offline-first payments that can later settle on-chain. Its purpose is to support practical everyday payments, micro-transactions, and machine-to-machine commerce in low-connectivity, edge-network, and IoT environments.","links":"https://dashpay.tech/","market_cap":9988.9,"market_cap_rank":11183,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dashpay_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"7GM8291Ze6AA9sA4Lr2B5nhLWWZJ6zhks9p6j8CMpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/7GM8291Ze6AA9sA4Lr2B5nhLWWZJ6zhks9p6j8CMpump"}},"is_native":false}
