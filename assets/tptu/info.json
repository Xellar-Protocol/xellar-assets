{"name":"TPTU","id":"tptu","symbol":"tptu","description":"TPTU is a multifunctional trading and utility token built on SMART Blockchain and serves as the gateway to the broader Ultima ecosystem, which includes over 3 million users across 120+ countries. The project aims to simplify user access to blockchain technologies by enabling plug-and-play interaction with automated trading bots, staking, and smart contract resources. TPTU can be used to activate the Ultima Trading bot — a platform that connects to major exchanges (e.g., MEXC, BingX) via API and executes trading strategies on the TPTU/USDT pair. In addition, users can freeze their TPTU tokens to receive UENERGY, a resource required to interact with the Ultima Chain. This provides low-cost access to blockchain transactions, DeFi, marketplaces, and other decentralized apps within the ecosystem. With a fixed supply of 15 million tokens, TPTU powers key products such as the Ultima Wallet, Ultima Card (crypto debit card), Umarkt marketplace (5M+ products), blockchain-integrated mobile games, and internal swap and staking platforms. The token's design supports real-world usability, reward generation, and frictionless adoption of decentralized financial tools.","links":"https://tpt-token.com/","market_cap":16979602,"market_cap_rank":1438,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/tptu/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":null}}}
