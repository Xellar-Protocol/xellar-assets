{"name":"alXAI","id":"alxai","symbol":"alxai","description":"alXAI is the stable pegged token of stXAI is a liquid staking derivative of the XAI token, part of the broader XAI ecosystem. The XAI ecosystem is a Layer 3 gaming blockchain built on Arbitrum, designed to support decentralized gaming applications and infrastructure. XAI staking is highly attractive to users. However, the conventional XAI staking system comes with significant drawbacksâ€”tokens are locked up for up to 180 days, and early redemptions can incur penalties as high as 75%. This can limit flexibility and access to funds, despite the high yield potential. stXAI addresses these challenges by offering a liquid staking alternative. With stXAI, users can stake their XAI assets without being tied to long lockup periods or facing heavy penalties. Holders of stXAI earn passive rewards from the XAI ecosystem while maintaining full liquidity, allowing them to trade, transfer, or redeem their tokens at any time. The stXAI can be converted into alXAI and then traded for XAI directly on DEXs.","links":"https://novadash.io","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/alxai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x4ac623237de0aa622b4fdf4da63cf97216371acf"}}}
