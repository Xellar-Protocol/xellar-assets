{"name":"SAKE","id":"sak3","symbol":"sak3","description":"SAKΞ is the first of its kind: a tokenized sake bridging tradition and technology with quality design. The pinnacle of the brewers' craft and technological innovation, every bottle of SAKΞ is a work of art. With the highest attention to the details of production, from planting rice seeds to hand-bottling to order, SAKΞ is curated by Sake Samurai Elliot Faber and produced by Kitanishi Shuzo, makers of Bunraku, with a bottle designed by BIG Architects and featuring the art of Jonathan Jay Lee. Only 888 bottles of SAKΞ will ever be made.","links":"https://sake.sushi.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/sak3/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe9f84de264e91529af07fa2c746e934397810334"}}}
