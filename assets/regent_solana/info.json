{"name":"REGENT","id":"regent_solana","symbol":"regent","description":"Regent represents a novel approach to LLM architecture, drawing inspiration from Daniel Kahneman's dual-process theory of cognition outlined in Thinking Fast and Slow. Regent implements a split-mind system that separates AI responses into distinct intuitive and reasoned phases, mirroring the human brain's System 1 (fast, intuitive) and System 2 (slow, deliberative) thinking processes. Combined with a modified RAG memory store, this allows an em to truly \"think step by step\" in the same way that humans do — with an internal reasoning monologue operating over the babble from a brilliant but unreliable intuition.","links":"https://regentsol.io","market_cap":72533,"market_cap_rank":7542,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/regent/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"6HgJHzGpq3fSLmkepsaC8F3VtpUWfXcG4hmUaf4Vpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/6HgJHzGpq3fSLmkepsaC8F3VtpUWfXcG4hmUaf4Vpump"}},"is_native":false}
