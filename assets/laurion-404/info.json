{"name":"Laurion 404","id":"laurion-404","symbol":"laurion","description":"Laurion is an experimental, DN404-based project that starts on Ethereum and continues on Blast. Miners are acquired by buying $LAURION on Uniswap or Laurion NFTs on various marketplaces. Each Laurion miner generates 1 ore per block. Miners are soft-staked by holding in your wallet. You must hold your $LAURION miner to keep your ore. If you sell or transfer, you will lose ores generated by that miner.","links":"https://www.laurion.xyz","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/laurion-404/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x61db59daf2af68310fffa003d3b2f452260b673c"}}}
