{"name":"Safegem","id":"safegem","symbol":"gems","description":"A Diamond Strong Community Safegem is a frictionless high-yield generation protocol combined with continuous permanent burn. With professionalism and transparency, we are building a united community across the entire crypto space. Safegem differentiates itself from other projects by being a 100% community owned and operated BSC token. The project is managed by a team of professional volunteers committed to realizing our unique vision for NFT authentication and brought together by our love of crypto and precious stones. Safegem has two functions as a high-yield generation protocol that takes place during each transaction: 6% of the transaction is redistributed to all GEMS holders and 5% is burned forever. As of June 2022, over 78% of all GEMS have been burned. In December 2021, Safegem launched their NFT marketplace https://safegemstore.com, featuring best-in-class NFT artwork and collectibles. In 2022, Safegem began offering physical gemstone authentication and certification utilizing the ERC-721 non-fungible token standard on Binance Smart Chain.","links":"https://safegemofficial.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/safegem/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xdfdec49462f7d3c3b0a48e729f77a0645cdfa7c0"}}}
