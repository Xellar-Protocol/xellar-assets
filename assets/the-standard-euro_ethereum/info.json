{"name":"The Standard EURO","id":"the-standard-euro_ethereum","symbol":"euros","description":"EUROs is a decentralized stablecoin pegged to the value of the Euro. It operates on a principle of over-collateralization, where users lock up assets exceeding 110% of the EUROs they mint. These EUROs represent a 0% interest debt, giving users the flexibility of minting without fixed repayment deadlines. Its design ensures stability, transparency, and user autonomy, eliminating reliance on centralized entities.","links":"https://TheStandard.io","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/the-standard-euro_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb399511642fe1666c6a07f83483e6e4feaed9a00","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xb399511642fe1666c6a07f83483e6e4feaed9a00"}},"is_native":false}
