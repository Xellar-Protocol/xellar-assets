{"name":"SolenceAi","id":"solenceai_solana","symbol":"sai","description":"SolenceAi is a Solana-native security and intelligence platform that analyzes on-chain wallet activity and produces deterministic risk scores for users, projects, and payment flows. It combines heuristic checks with AI-generated guidance to help users identify unsafe wallets, suspicious interactions, and exploit-prone patterns. The platform also issues an on-chain “Safety Badge” for wallets that meet defined security thresholds, and exposes the same logic through a public API/SDK so developers can integrate wallet checks into their dApps, bots, and payment products. The SAI token is used inside the ecosystem for accessing premium scans, minting the badge, and paying for developer features.","links":"https://www.solenceai.com/","market_cap":5193.49,"market_cap_rank":12308,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/solenceai_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"GUhVUdAgT2VPaDL9EtCTqBptX8ENrgs5WqR3c8EJpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/GUhVUdAgT2VPaDL9EtCTqBptX8ENrgs5WqR3c8EJpump"}},"is_native":false}
