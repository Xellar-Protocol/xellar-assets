{"name":"POPG","id":"popg_ethereum","symbol":"popg","description":"Launched in mid-2024, POPG is a Web3 entertainment ecosystem designed to enhance user engagement across rewards, iGaming, and live events. The project centers around the POPG Token, an entertainment utility token that provides users access across the ecosystem's platforms. POPG consists of three interconnected platforms: POP.VIP: A tiered VIP rewards system that allows users to earn rebates by saving $POPG. Higher levels offer bigger rebates that can be redeemed for entertainment products and services. The tier system also acts as a qualifier for the exclusive events platform. POP.GAME: An iGaming platform focused on transparency and responsibility. POP.GAME builds its policies with community input, offering an alternative to traditional iGaming. POP.LIVE: An exclusive platform for premium event access. Based on users' levels in POP.VIP, they receive exclusive access to purchase tickets for concerts, sports matches, and other major events. The project takes a community-centric approach, making community involvement a central aspect of the development process and gathering input to continuously improve the ecosystem. POPG is strongly focused on maximizing the utility of its token and ecosystem, aiming to offer a seamless and rewarding entertainment experience.","links":"https://popg.com","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/popg/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xdac070102b0cfde1493026454c9c608924f6db71","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xdac070102b0cfde1493026454c9c608924f6db71"}},"is_native":false}
