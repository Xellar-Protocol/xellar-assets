{"name":"e-Money EUR","id":"e-money-eur","symbol":"eeur","description":"e-Money stablecoins are a further stage in the development of collateralized stablecoins, but with some great advantages of their own which truly set them apart. Firstly, e-Money stablecoins are not prone to the many drawbacks and inherent instability of algorithmic stablecoins. e-Money stablecoins are collateralized in the same currency as which they are issued so the eEUR stablecoin is collateralized in Euros. The simplicity of this system also means that currency-backed stablecoins are highly efficient and liquid.","links":"https://e-money.com","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/e-money-eur/logo.png"}
