{"name":"Amnis Finance","id":"ami","symbol":"ami","description":"Amnis Finance - a Pioneering Liquidity Staking on Aptos. As a foundational component of the Aptos ecosystem, Amnis Finance introduces a secure, user-friendly and innovative liquid staking protocol that empowers users to effortlessly maximize returns on their APT tokens while unlocking their liquidity. Features Liquid Staking on Aptos Traditional Proof-of-Stake ̣̣̣̣̣(PoS) protocols used to be about users locking their tokens and receiving an anticipated amount of staking reward in exchange. However, because these tokens are locked, users are prevented from trading or investing in other token pairs on other platforms. This consequently restricts the ability to explore higher-yield opportunities. Amnis Finance offers the capability of liquid staking, a pivotal concept in the realm of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Through this feature, Amnis allows users to instantly receive tokens of equivalent value to those they have staked, enabling them to make use of the value of these tokens in transactions or other activities of interest, all without necessitating the unstaking process and the subsequent waiting period for token release. Liquid staking also provides flexibility for users to take advantage of trading or investment opportunities without having to withdraw tokens from the PoS network.","links":"https://amnis.finance/","market_cap":8780752,"market_cap_rank":1651,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ami/logo.png","detail_platform":{"aptos":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"0xb36527754eb54d7ff55daf13bcb54b42b88ec484bd6f0e3b2e0d1db169de6451"}}}
