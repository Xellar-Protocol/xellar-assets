Governance The Defina team is planning to adopt a governance system to allow Defina Finance to become a decentralized autonomous organization. $FINA will be the governance token for the community to do proposal votings. The Defina team will start with a centralized operation first, and gradually pivot to a decentralized project to ensure the project starts off strong. Defi Rewards In order to increase the liquidity of $FINA on the decentralized exchange (DEX), a proportion of our reserved tokens will be rewarded to the liquidity providers.","links":"https://defina.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/defina-finance/logo.png"}
