{"name":"Griffin Land","id":"griffin-land","symbol":"gland","description":"Griffin Land is a blockchain-based, play-to-earn battle game powered by NFT technology, inspired by the mythological characters where each hero is an NFT. Players can go on heroic adventures, fight each other in mythical battles and earn plenty of items and redeemable rewards. The game is built on the Binance Smart Chain. Griffin Land's unusual in-game economy and reward system aims to prevent the usual in-game token selling pressure by providing the in-game rewards from inside the game.","links":"https://griffin.land/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/griffin-land/logo.png"}
