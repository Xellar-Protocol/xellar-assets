{"name":"MINER","id":"miner","symbol":"miner","description":"MINER is a collection of 100,000 avatars tied to the first tokens built on ERC-X, a fully optimized, experimental standard that enables the use of multiple standards in one (ERC20, ERC404, ERC721, ERC721A, ERC721Psi, ERC1155, and ERC1155Delta). ERC-X is gas-efficient and scales to nearly any project size, with adjustable tokens per NFT amount. It also reintroduces all the standard features from ERC20s such as anti-snipe for smoother launches.","links":"https://miner.build/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/miner/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x23cbb9f0de3258de03baad2bcea4fccc55233af0"}}}
