{"name":"Lumiii","id":"lumiiitoken","symbol":"lumiii","description":"Lumiii: A Convergence Lifestyle Brand and Ecosystem with Entertainment, Gaming, Learn-To-Earn, Metaverse, and Family DeFi Platforms. ------- Lumiii is an entertainment brand – specifically, a tween anime and convergence lifestyle brand – that uses interactive storytelling, learn-to-earn gaming, and DeFi, to build the next generations of skilled and conscientious people. Lumiii is training the untrainable and banking the unbankable people of the world with its 360 ecosystem comprised of world-class animation, play-to-earn gaming, NFTs, a network of platforms (learn-to-earn, AR Metaverse, Family DeFi), and consumer packaged goods – crafted by Secret Pirates: A AAA team comprised of the world’s best storytellers, designers, developers, marketers, and operators. Lumiii solves a massive global problem: No access and no guidance. There are currently zero co-engagement experiences or onboarding resources for families in Web3 – problematic, considering that only 49% of parents talk to their kids about crypto, but over 86% of kids ask their parents about crypto. Bigger than that, there are no gamified learning resources on the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) or future-needed job skills like product marketing, game development, and machine learning – all of which are critical for individuals and families throughout the world. Lumiii provides free gamified and incentivized education on the UNSDGs, Web3 essentials, and future-needed job skills. Through its partnership with UCL EdTech Labs, Lumiii's learn-to-earn platform, LumiiiAcademy, will be reaching over 10M students around the world.","links":"https://lumiii.com","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/lumiiitoken/logo.png"}
