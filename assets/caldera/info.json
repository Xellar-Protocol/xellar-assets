{"name":"Caldera","id":"caldera","symbol":"era","description":"Caldera is a rollup platform on Ethereum that enables horizontal scaling and interoperability between rollups. Instead of optimizing a single blockchain, Caldera allows projects to launch customizable rollups while maintaining Ethereum's security and decentralization. The platform introduces the Metalayer, a unifying layer designed to connect rollups across Optimistic and Zero-Knowledge (ZK) frameworks. This enables coordination, communication, and resource sharing while preserving the distinct features of each rollup.","links":"https://www.caldera.xyz/","market_cap":119742361,"market_cap_rank":462,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/caldera/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe2ad0bf751834f2fbdc62a41014f84d67ca1de2a","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xe2ad0bf751834f2fbdc62a41014f84d67ca1de2a"},"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x00312400303d02c323295f6e8b7309bc30fb6bce","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x00312400303d02c323295f6e8b7309bc30fb6bce"}}}
