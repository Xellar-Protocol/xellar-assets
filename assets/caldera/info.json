{"name":"Caldera","id":"caldera","symbol":"era","description":"Caldera is a rollup platform on Ethereum that enables horizontal scaling and interoperability between rollups. Instead of optimizing a single blockchain, Caldera allows projects to launch customizable rollups while maintaining Ethereum's security and decentralization. The platform introduces the Metalayer, a unifying layer designed to connect rollups across Optimistic and Zero-Knowledge (ZK) frameworks. This enables coordination, communication, and resource sharing while preserving the distinct features of each rollup.","links":"https://www.caldera.xyz/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/caldera/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
