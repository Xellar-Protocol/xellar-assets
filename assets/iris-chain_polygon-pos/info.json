{"name":"IRIS Chain","id":"iris-chain_polygon-pos","symbol":"irc","description":"IRIS Chain is a blockchain-based digital identity and health infrastructure project that uses AI-powered iris recognition to provide decentralized identity verification (DID) and personalized healthcare services. By integrating biometric data with blockchain and AI, IRIS Chain enables secure, non-invasive health monitoring and digital ID issuance across devices such as KIOSKs and smartphones. The IRC token serves as a utility token for subscribing to health services, accessing AI-based health analytics, verifying user identity via APIs, and participating in future staking/governance mechanisms. The project aims to build a globally accessible health-data and identity protocol compliant with data privacy regulations (e.g. GDPR), currently active across Japan, Korea, China, and Vietnam.","links":"https://www.irischain.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/iris-chain_polygon-pos/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf9a3e803ed270cf0ca6cd76ea40b8cc8562cf93f","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/polygon_pos/tokens/0xf9a3e803ed270cf0ca6cd76ea40b8cc8562cf93f"}},"is_native":false}
