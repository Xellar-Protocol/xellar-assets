{"name":"MINGMING","id":"mingming_solana","symbol":"ming","description":"$MING is inspired by Sachi, the cat that started it all — a reminder of simplicity, loyalty, and real Filipino vibes. We wanted to create a truly Filipino native token, something that feels ours. And what better name than “Ming Ming” — the most common and beloved name for pet cats across the Philippines. It’s familiar, it’s warm, and it instantly connects with every Filipino household. $MING isn’t just a meme — it’s culture, identity, and community rolled into one. From Sachi’s spirit to the Filipino heart, this token is built for the people, by the people.","links":"https://www.mingming.world/","market_cap":3030.49,"market_cap_rank":12904,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mingming_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"9uu3yAY9uAa76pxjAuFe8BPKEQ56CZGJnaxstgW1pump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/9uu3yAY9uAa76pxjAuFe8BPKEQ56CZGJnaxstgW1pump"}},"is_native":false}
