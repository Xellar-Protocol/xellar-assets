How do I benefit by holding this token? - By holding this token you are rewarded with 4% #BB reflections in turn are then being rewarded with 5% BTC rewards by accumulating on the reflections. ( #BBBR > #BB > #BTC ) Why should I ape? - This token is backed/partnered with the daddy token & also backed by whales. You are accumulating a constant burning supply and by holding this token is also on a constant burn. YOU ARE VERY EARLY.
