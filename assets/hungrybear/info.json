Hungry bear has for noble mission to solve this issue as well as helping in the conservation of endangered species. Providing relief for the economically disadvantaged benefits humanity in many more ways. With this primary need already fulfilled, people would be able to focus on growing and leading a worthy life. The philanthropic aspect of Hungry Bear is a founding pillar as to why we started this cryptocurrency project. As such, charity donations will be made on a regular basis to different organizations with a similar vision. Doing so can only be made possible by remaining a tight-knit community that is looking to make a difference and sees long-term, by establishing essential and strategic partnerships as well as demonstrating full transparency over our actions.","links":"https://hungrybear.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/hungrybear/logo.png"}
