{"name":"aPriori","id":"apriori_ethereum","symbol":"apr","description":"aPriori is building the intelligent order flow coordination layer for high-performance blockchains. Its architecture comprises an Order Flow Segmentation Engine that classifies trades in real time and a flow-aware routing engine that directs benign orders into efficient liquidity pools while isolating riskier ones to resilient paths. The system integrates MEV capture with a redistribution mechanism, returning value to stakers and validators to better align incentives.","links":"https://apr.io","market_cap":24117874,"market_cap_rank":1011,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/apriori_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x5a9610919f5e81183823a2be4bd1beb2b4da2a20","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x5a9610919f5e81183823a2be4bd1beb2b4da2a20"}},"is_native":false}
