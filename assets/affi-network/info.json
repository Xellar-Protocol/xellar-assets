{"name":"Affi Network","id":"affi-network","symbol":"affi","description":"Affi Network is a decentralized on-chain incentives platform, which enables marketers to incentivize users for on-chain actions, such as voting, swapping, minting, staking, depositing, or playing. While the first iteration of our platform focused on affiliate incentives for NFT mints, our commitment to evolution led us to expand our research into participation incentives for DeFi, GameFi, DAOs, and beyond. With V2 underway and set to launch in 2024, we invite you to join us in revolutionizing incentive distribution for millions of users worldwide, while increasing transparency, security, and efficiency for performance marketers on a global scale.","links":"https://affi.network/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/affi-network/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x1c15926ea330c394d891fd88f62d37ea6af953c3"}}}
