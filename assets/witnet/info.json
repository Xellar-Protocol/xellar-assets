{"name":"Witnet","id":"witnet","symbol":"wit","description":"The Witnet protocol enables smart contracts to realize their true potential by giving them access to all sorts of valuable data sets, and by attesting and delivering that information securely thanks to its strong cryptoeconomic guarantees. Witnet is specially designed for “autonomous” smart contracts — those that require a high degree of tamper resistance and shouldn’t leave space for manipulation. Witnet can power most DeFi primitives like price feeds, stable coins, derivatives, etc., as well as acting as a reliable source of randomness for creating uniqueness in NFTs.","links":"https://witnet.io/","market_cap":3344760,"market_cap_rank":2188,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/witnet/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
