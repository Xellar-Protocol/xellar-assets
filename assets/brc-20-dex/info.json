{"name":"BRC-20 DEX","id":"brc-20-dex","symbol":"bd20","description":"The BRC20 DEX Exchange is an innovative decentralized exchange built on the BRC20 protocol. In recent years, decentralized exchanges (DEX) have gained significant traction in the blockchain ecosystem due to their enhanced security, transparency, and user control over funds. The BRC20 DEX Exchange builds upon these principles and aims to provide a seamless and secure trading experience for BRC20 tokens. The BRC-20 DEX Bridge provides a sophisticated yet user-friendly mechanism for transferring BRC-20 tokens from Bitcoin to EVM networks. Users initiate the transfer to a designated BRC-20 address, and upon successful confirmation, these tokens become eligible for minting on Ethereum (ETH), Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Polygon (Matic). Additionally, the bridge supports the reverse process, enabling the transfer of assets from EVM networks back to the BRC-20 blockchain, ensuring a complete, bidirectional flow of assets across these diverse blockchain ecosystems.","links":"https://brc-20dex.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/brc-20-dex/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x312d43881860807fa04b193d69744d087fc3308a"},"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x312d43881860807fa04b193d69744d087fc3308a"}}}
