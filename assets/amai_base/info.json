{"name":"AMAI","id":"amai_base","symbol":"amai","description":"AMAI (Autonomous Multi-Agent Intelligence) is a decentralized ecosystem that enables the creation, coordination, and capitalization of autonomous AI agents on-chain. AMAI introduces a programmable framework where agents can act as wallets, execute strategies, and form “Smart Swarms” that collaborate autonomously. The protocol focuses on establishing on-chain trust through bonded staking and behavioral reputation. AMAI’s mission is to build a “machine-first economy,” where intelligent agents can earn, spend, and create value without centralized control.","links":"https://www.amai.net/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/amai_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xdb4f5678aa11bbe0f980bf36c511d923bd3d5471","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xdb4f5678aa11bbe0f980bf36c511d923bd3d5471"}},"is_native":false}
