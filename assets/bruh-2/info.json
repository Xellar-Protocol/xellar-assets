{"name":"Bruh","id":"bruh-2","symbol":"bruh","description":"Meet $BRUH, a green monster who's tired of the hype, the pumps, and the inevitable dumps. Unlike other tokens, $BRUH doesn't care about the moon or lambos. In fact, $BRUH doesn't care about much at all. He's seen the meme tokens come and go, watched as their value bled to zero, and he's had enough. So, what does $BRUH do? He launches his own token, of course. Powered by the iconic Mike Wazowski $BRUH face, $BRUH is here to spread a different kind of energyâ€”a laid-back, \"whatever\" attitude that's refreshingly honest in a space filled with overzealous optimism. This isn't about creating the next big thing; it's about embracing the $BRUH moments in life, those times when you just want to throw your hands up and say, \"Bruh.\"","links":"https://bruheth.com/","market_cap":1132733,"market_cap_rank":2669,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bruh-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd7cfdb3cdc33dbeb9e9a4c95b61953cf12a008b3"}}}
