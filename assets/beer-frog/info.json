{"name":"Beer Frog","id":"beer-frog","symbol":"frog","description":"Beer Frog is a meme project inspired by Matt Furies first frog, presented on his website mattfurie.com on April 16 2004. The idea that this blue eyed frog with blue eyes and a beer belly was the first Matt drew was reason enough to dedicate a token to him. Beer Frog is basically the Nestor of Matt Furie memes. Also known as the FrogFather (referenced to DogeFather - Elon Musk). The project also is a hommage to the original creator, Matt Furie.","links":"https://beerfrogeth.com","market_cap":312668,"market_cap_rank":5020,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/beer-frog/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x0101013d11e4320d29759f40508c61110f525211"}}}
