{"name":"Secret","id":"secret","symbol":"scrt","description":"Secret is the native coin of the Secret Network, a decentralized network for private / secure computation. Nodes on the network (known as secret nodes) can perform generalizable computations over encrypted data, which allows smart contracts (known as secret contracts) to use private and sensitive data as inputs. Our focus is on computational privacy, not just transactional privacy. Developers can build decentralized, privacy-preserving \"Secret Apps\" on the network. The privacy functionality of the Secret Network is critical for many fields, including decentralized finance, Web3, machine learning, access control, and many more. The Secret Network is supported by many independent development teams and entities, including Enigma, Secret Foundation, Secretnodes.org, Chain of Secrets, and more","links":"https://scrt.network","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/secret/logo.png","detail_platform":{"secret":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"secret1k0jntykt7e4g3y88ltc60czgjuqdy4c9e8fzek"}}}
