It also features a Shiba Inu on it's logo, but in a form of a memeful and not that smart example. The Dogu Inu's code received 100 out of 100 points on TokenSniffer. It has an ambition to further develop into a project that's features are something more than just creative graphics and community management, but the creators haven't disclose what will it be yet.","links":"https://www.doguinu.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dogu-inu/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8326bf664704966c984a3a46fa37d7a80a52dcf4"}}}
