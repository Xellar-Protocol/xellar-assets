It also features a Shiba Inu on it's logo, but in a form of a memeful and not that smart example. The Dogu Inu's code received 100 out of 100 points on TokenSniffer. It has an ambition to further develop into a project that's features are something more than just creative graphics and community management, but the creators haven't disclose what will it be yet.","links":"https://www.doguinu.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dogu-inu/logo.png"}
