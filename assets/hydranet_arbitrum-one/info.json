{"name":"Hydranet","id":"hydranet_arbitrum-one","symbol":"hdn","description":"What is the project about? Hydranet is the first fully decentralized trading network that combines the speed and cost-efficiency of centralized exchanges, while preserving the self-custody and security of DeFi. Leveraging off-chain protocols such as the Lightning Network for Bitcoin and Hydranet’s Lithium Network for EVM and smart contract-based blockchains, Hydranet offers trustless, peer-to-peer trading with instant trade confirmations and zero network fees, even when trading between different blockchains. Using Hydranet, traders no longer need to compromise on security, scalability, and decentralization - they get it all! Hydranet is designed for everyone, offering multiple trading interfaces. Casual traders can use recognizable interfaces similar to popular DEXs for a simplified one-click trading experience, while experienced traders can opt for an order book interface or API, providing greater flexibility for advanced trading strategies. Beyond its key features - instant trades, zero network fees, and cross-chain trading - Hydranet introduces several innovations: the Lithium protocol (a state channel protocol for smart contract-based blockchains akin to the Lightning Network), the first-ever Lightning (and Lithium) off-chain nodes running directly in a browser environment, and an external off-chain signer for secure signatures of off-chain transactions. Read more about Hydranet on their documentation page: https://docs.hydranet.ai/ What makes your project unique? Hydranet offers an entirely new approach to solving the blockchain trilemma of security, scalability, and decentralization. While other decentralized projects turn to sidechains to address scalability, Hydranet takes a different route by using off-chain protocols that run on top of established blockchains. Sidechains often lead to issues in DeFi, such as liquidity fragmentation and increased ecosystem complexity. By focusing on off-chain protocols, Hydranet allows original blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum to scale without sacrificing liquidity, decentralization, or security. Hydranet doesn’t just enhance the scalability of these blockchains, it also connects them, enabling seamless cross-chain trading with full control, instant confirmations, and zero network fees! What can your coin/token be used for? HDN is the native token of the Hydranet Network and plays a central role in the network’s operation and governance. It enables community members to actively participate in maintaining and securing the decentralized infrastructure that powers Hydranet’s off-chain DEX. By locking HDN as collateral, token holders can operate Titans or Guardians - two key node roles in the Hydranet Network. Titans facilitate the trading process by hosting the off-chain order book and matching trades, while Guardians ensure network integrity by monitoring behavior and enforcing protocol rules. Both roles are essential to the trustless, decentralized operation of the network, and are rewarded for their contributions.","links":"https://hydranet.ai/","market_cap":6244968,"market_cap_rank":1896,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/hydranet/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb0f66bdb39acbb043308eb9dbe78f5bb47ea5430","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/arbitrum/tokens/0xb0f66bdb39acbb043308eb9dbe78f5bb47ea5430"}},"is_native":false}
