{"name":"Action Coin","id":"action-coin","symbol":"actn","description":"The Action Coin Platform represents over 1 Million Action collectors and customers from more than 200 countries and territories. It is the basis of an incentive-driven rewards program with “points” that are rewarded in the form of a decentralized, blockchain-based digital asset known as Action (“ACTN”). Action may be redeemed for member-only discounts on a growing list of products and services offered through our business network. Vendors market and sell their products and services through the Action Coin Platform in exchange for Action Coin (“Action” or “ACTN”). It is up to the vendor to determine how much Action they are prepared to accept for their products or services (the suggested rate of exchange for deals on the Action Coin Platform is 1,000 ACTN for every $1 USD in value). They may choose to accept Action Coin for partial payment or full payment, but their choice and their terms of business must be clearly stated and explained within the description of their offer. Action Coin (“Action” or “ACTN”) is earned by joining our website, referring friends and family to our platform and participating in community activities. You may also find and collect Action Coin in “Augmented Reality“. Community members may use their Action Coin to obtain deals and discounts on a growing list of products and services offered by Vendors from more than 26 countries. They may also trade their ACTN for other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). The price and liquidity of ACTN is determined on the Open Market.","links":"https://actioncoin.com","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/action-coin/logo.png"}
