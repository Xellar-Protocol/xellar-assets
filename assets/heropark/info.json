{"name":"HeroPark","id":"heropark","symbol":"hp","description":"\"HeroPark is a GameFi-based platform that creates a gaming ecosystem for play-to-earn (P2E) by combining traditional gameplay with modern decentralised finance (DeFi) tech such as blockchain, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and creating its own gaming metaverse. HeroPark is revolutionising modern-age gaming by integrating DeFi and NFTs with blockchain gaming, and in doing so, creating an ecosystem where users can play-to-earn instead of play-to-win. The key motivation behind HeroPark is that it strives to empower both the gaming users and developers within the ecosystem. In the HeroPark ecosystem, developers get the chance to leverage HeroPark infrastructure to tokenise their gaming projects, raise funds, offer NFTs and, in the process, create revenue streams for themselves. Similarly, users can play multiple games whereby they can earn passive income through NFTs collection, gameplay and getting rewards from the play-to-earn. By integrating GameFi with HeroPark, users also get DeFi features such as staking, farming, NFT minting and trading.\"","links":"https://heropark.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/heropark/logo.png"}
