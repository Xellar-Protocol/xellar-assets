{"name":"Liquity USD","id":"liquity-usd_polygon-pos","symbol":"lusd","description":"LUSD is a fully redeemable USD-pegged stablecoin issued by the Liquity Protocol. Liquity is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows you to draw 0% interest loans against Ether used as collateral. Loans are paid out in LUSD and need to maintain a minimum collateral ratio of only 110%. In addition to the collateral, the loans are secured by a Stability Pool containing LUSD and by fellow borrowers collectively acting as guarantors of last resort. Liquity as a protocol is non-custodial, immutable, and governance-free.","links":"https://www.liquity.org/","market_cap":36372791,"market_cap_rank":782,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/liquity-usd_polygon-pos/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x23001f892c0c82b79303edc9b9033cd190bb21c7","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/polygon_pos/tokens/0x23001f892c0c82b79303edc9b9033cd190bb21c7"}},"is_native":false}
