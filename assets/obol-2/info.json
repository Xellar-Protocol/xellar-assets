{"name":"Obol","id":"obol-2","symbol":"obol","description":"Obol exists to distribute, decentralize, and democratize the digital infrastructure of the future — starting with Ethereum, and expanding to all of Web3. As the foundation for Layer 1 blockchains and decentralized infrastructure networks, the Obol Collective is home to the world’s largest decentralized operator ecosystem. Today, over 800 operators globally decentralized operators run Obol Distributed Validators (DVs) to secure more than $1B on mainnet. Obol DVs deliver better performance, fewer risks, and greater rewards than traditional validators — empowering anyone to run high-performance, slashing-resistant validators. Alongside DVs, the Obol Stack is a modular, plug-and-play framework that makes it easy to deploy and manage Ethereum nodes, AI agents, AVSs, and other decentralized infrastructure. From L1s and L2s to DePIN, AVSs, AI Agents, and beyond — Obol is powering the next generation of decentralized systems.","links":"https://obol.org/","market_cap":13453542,"market_cap_rank":1375,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/obol-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0b010000b7624eb9b3dfbc279673c76e9d29d5f7"}}}
