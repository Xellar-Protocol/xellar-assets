{"name":"Viridis Network","id":"viridis-network","symbol":"vrd","description":"Viridis.Network is a token built to facilitate decentralized finance for carbon - it will be the gas token of the upcoming Viridis.Network L2, bridgable from ETH onto a dedicated, low-gas chain. Crucially, each Viridis token is made to represent 1 tonne of carbon - when the Viridis onramp is built, users can exchange verified carbon credits for Viridis and explore a full ecosystem of carbon-driven DeFI. The ultimate aim of Viridis is to bring greater financial interest and volume to the carbon market, and grant this growing market the convenience and growth of Decentralized Finance applications.","links":"https://viridis.network","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/viridis-network/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf25304e75026e6a35fedca3b0889ae5c4d3c55d8"}}}
