{"name":"Solomon USDv","id":"solomon-usdv","symbol":"usdv","description":"Solomon USDv is a Solana‑native synthetic dollar issued by Solomon Labs. The protocol delta‑hedges spot positions (typically SOL, ETH or wrapped BTC held on‑chain) with equal‑and‑opposite perpetual shorts to create a fully market‑neutral collateral base, allowing USDv to hold its one‑dollar peg while generating yield. This yield is then passed back to users that have staked USDv for sUSDv. Like other stablecoins, USDv is designed to be composable within the DeFi ecosystem. All contracts are on‑chain, audited.","links":"https://solomonlabs.org","market_cap":1136449,"market_cap_rank":3523,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/solomon-usdv/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"Ex5DaKYMCN6QWFA4n67TmMwsH8MJV68RX6YXTmVM532C"}}}
