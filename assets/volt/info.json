{"name":"Volt","id":"volt","symbol":"acdc","description":"VOLT is a platform that allows centralized platforms such as Uber, to be developed in a decentralized manner and enables direct delivery through P2P. Uber and other models play a role of Central Control as middlemen and receive a fee of 20% or more. VOLTâ€™s P2P direct deal model is an efficient model that aims to eliminate brokerage fee by lowering direct costs to customers and messengers, to less than 5%, or even in hopes to eliminate completely. The existing delivery model is a centralized model, with a system called Hub & Spoke. This centralized model, including DHL, has dominated the delivery market worldwide. However, the centralized model is unable to meet the needs of same day delivery. VOLT is blockchain-based P2P delivery model that solves limitation of the same day delivery more effectively than existing models. Core Concept Decentralization VOLT is a decentralized platform. There is no middleman or broker, which leads to lower the cost offered for customers, and also maximize profit for the messengers. Transparency In VOLT, we offer a transparent environment. All customers and messengers or delivery companies benefit from the privacy and transparency of the fees and expenses. Security A secure payment system that allows two authenticated P2P entities to send and receive money that gets held in VOLT Tokens until after a successful exchange of services between the two parties.","links":"https://volttech.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/volt/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xfc44ec51c80e35a87bc2140299b1636ec83dfb04"}}}
