{"name":"Lucrosus Capital","id":"lucrosus-capital","symbol":"$luca","description":"Lucrosus Capital aims to be the first decentralized Venture Capital, thanks to our utility token - $LUCA. Lucrosus Capital team will be constantly monitoring the market looking for investment opportunities and after complex research will connect projects with Lucrosus Capital's community. Holders of the $LUCA token will be able to receive an allocation in the early stages of cooperative projects and take advantage of buy-back events provided by our company. It all will be due to part of the Lucrosus Capital income used to buy back tokens from the open market. Thanks to the shared allocation program, our company provides investment opportunities that are currently reserved for institutions to individual investors. It is combined with supporting the development of the most lucrative blockchain initiatives which results in the development of the whole market.","links":"https://www.lucrosus.capital/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/lucrosus-capital/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf82aa46120314904cd8119dac84f6bcc7d90ed2e"}}}
