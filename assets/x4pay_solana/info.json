Create a discovery layer for x402 enabled machines like robots, drones, even vending machine or even a coffee machine. It provides both human to machine and machine to machine autonomous payments. Powering up future, making a global mesh of machines which accept x402 payments. we are done with : Low level SDKs for microcontrollers which verifies and settles x402 payments on a 520Kb microcontroller. Cross platform app with tap to pay feature A remaining python SDK will enable global mesh.","links":"https://x4pay.org/","market_cap":73657,"market_cap_rank":7538,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/x4pay/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"6ikxp2KnQcdCik8Aadi2ScE7qgH4j5C7BvSyA29Wpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/6ikxp2KnQcdCik8Aadi2ScE7qgH4j5C7BvSyA29Wpump"}},"is_native":false}
