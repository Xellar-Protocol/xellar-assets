{"name":"Genesis Shards","id":"genesis-shards","symbol":"gs","description":"Genesis Shards (GS) is a whole new marketplace for pre-IDO tokens on NFTs powered by Polkadot. GS was created to usher in a new paradigm for DeFi transforming NFTs into a liquidity vehicle for pre-IDO tokens, and to introduce a whole new suite of DeFi products across multiple blockchains. Most pre-IDO transactions are currently being executed in OTC. With this come the problems of a) illiquidity and also b) the big problem of highly inconsistent OTC trade practices for pre-IDO tokens. Trades are often conducted by two parties in an uncertain environment with a high risk of default. GS aims to 'NFT-y' the OTC market - transforming NFTs into a liquidity vehicle for pre-IDO tokens. By wrapping time-locked fungible tokens into NFTs, Genesis Shards is creating a new marketplace for previously illiquid tokens. Also, investors will no longer have to worry about shady OTC deals with high default risk : they can simply utilize the safe, trustless pre-IDO liquidity provided by Genesis NFTs.","links":"https://www.genshards.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/genesis-shards/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe0b9a2c3e9f40cf74b2c7f591b2b0cca055c3112"},"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x9ba4c78b048eeed69f4ed3cfddeda7b51baf7ca8"}}}
