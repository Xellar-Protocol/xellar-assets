{"name":"Fetch.ai","id":"fetch-ai","symbol":"fet","description":"Fetch.ai is delivering AI to the crypto economy. Digital Twins, powered by artificial intelligence, can provide automation to decentralized finance that can serve the needs of a single user or aggregate millions of data points for on-chain oracles. These agent-based systems provide greater flexibility, speed and crypto-economic security than existing oracle networks and represent the future of decentralized finance. This technology enables creation of personalized oracles that maintain userâ€™s DeFi positions using decentralized and non-custodial protocols to increase the security and convenience of crypto asset management. The Fetch.ai network is an interchain protocol, based on the Cosmos-SDK, and uses a high-performance WASM-based smart contract language (Cosmwasm) to allow advanced cryptography and machine learning logic to be implemented on chain. This also allows the Fetch.ai network to serve as a layer-2 network for Ethereum and as an interchain bridge to the rest of the blockchain world.","links":"https://fetch.ai/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/fetch-ai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xaea46a60368a7bd060eec7df8cba43b7ef41ad85"},"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x031b41e504677879370e9dbcf937283a8691fa7f"},"osmosis":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":"ibc/5D1F516200EE8C6B2354102143B78A2DEDA25EDE771AC0F8DC3C1837C8FD4447"}}}
