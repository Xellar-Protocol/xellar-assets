{"name":"Lady Uni","id":"lady-uni","symbol":"luni","description":"Lady Uni ($LUNI) is the start of something much bigger than a token. It marks the first building blocks of the Luniverse. The Luniverse involves multiple things: • Lady Uni ($LUNI) • Lunicorns (NFTs) • Astrolady (Lady Uni travelling to the metaverse) • Luni Park (Multiplayer Metaverse) The Luniverse has been in construction for over two months and launched with functionality and utility already built in. The Lunicorns NFT collection is reflective and provides 7% rewards in BNB! They also provide a 10% buyback and burn to the token. Eventually Lunicorns will be used in the 3D Mulitplayer Metaverse to exhange for skins and items, and the long term vision is that they will assist in the governance. Luni Park was built on the teams vision of creating a fun, safe space to connect projects with investors, while remaining fun for people who just want to play and earn with their friends! With the park ever expanding and new utility being added every week, Luni Park will quickly become the go-to place.","links":"https://www.luniverse.world/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/lady-uni/logo.png"}
