{"name":"Eywa","id":"eywa","symbol":"eywa","description":"Eywa is an ecosystem that facilitates communication between blockchains and comprises two major components: Consensus bridge - a trustless token and data bridge that uses the consensus of the most secure data transfer protocols in the market for transaction verification, such as Axelar, Chainlink CCIP, L0, Wormhole. CrossCurve - an innovative cross-chain trading and yield protocol that addresses the issue of fragmented liquidity through the use of Curve Finance's deep liquidity pools, the world's largest decentralized exchange. Our mission is to unite the fragmented DeFi market. We aim to enable the industry to reach a new level of maturity and adapt DeFi for the masses. We intend to make decentralized finance efficient, simple, convenient, and understandable, even for beginners. To this end, we are dedicated to simplifying the user experience of interacting with DeFi as much as possible. At the same time, it is extremely important to us that decentralized finance remains truly decentralized, and we do not wish to compromise on this principle, as many do. Eywa gives users the ability to quickly and economically exchange assets across different networks and provides yield farming for liquidity providers.","links":"https://eywa.fi/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/eywa/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8cb8c4263eb26b2349d74ea2cb1b27bc40709e12"},"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x7a10f506e4c7658e6ad15fdf0443d450b7fa80d7"},"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x7a10f506e4c7658e6ad15fdf0443d450b7fa80d7"},"fantom":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x7a10f506e4c7658e6ad15fdf0443d450b7fa80d7"}}}
