{"name":"GRAIN","id":"grain-2","symbol":"grain","description":"Paloma is a fast, permissionless Cosmos-SDK blockchain that securely moves messages between any other blockchains. It is designed for developers who wish to manage bidirectional messages between chains in a scalable and secure manner. Paloma validators, also known as pigeons, validate and secure the blockchain network state. Paloma AI LightNodes manages the delegation of stake across all validators to ensure blockchain interoperability across all Paloma target chains. Validators on Paloma must all support each target chain voted into governance, providing an infrastructure to deliver computing middleware services on all target blockchains. Paloma AI LightNodes locally store AI context window data. When a LightNode user wishes to use their Paloma LightNode CustomAI application, the LightNodes access Paloma's API infrastructure to access decentralized LLM APIs provisioned by the Paloma network.","links":"https://palomachain.com","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/grain-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
