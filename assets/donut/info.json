{"name":"Donut","id":"donut","symbol":"donut","description":"Donuts are Ethereum main-net ERC-20 tokens that represent community contribution & engagement at the /r/ethtrader subreddit. Users earn Donuts simply by participating and contributing content to /r/ethtrader. An easy way to think of them is a spendable and trade-able karma, but exclusive to /r/ethtrader. Donuts can be used to purchase aesthetic perks via a special subscription as well as the top banner, which is often used for advertising purposes. Donuts can also be tipped to other users and are used as vote weight in community governance polls. Subreddit members receive Donuts in monthly batches, and may receive them on the Ethereum main net or opt to receive them on the xDai sidechain. Liquidity staking incentives are available for liquidity providers on Uniswap (Ethereum main net) and Honeyswap (xDai). Donuts are the very first prototype of Reddit's Community Points initiative, which has since spread to /r/cryptocurrency (MOON) and /r/fortniteBR (BRICK).","links":"https://www.donut.foundation","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/donut/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc0f9bd5fa5698b6505f643900ffa515ea5df54a9"},"xdai":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x524b969793a64a602342d89bc2789d43a016b13a"}}}
