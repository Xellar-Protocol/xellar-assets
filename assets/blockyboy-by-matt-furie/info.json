{"name":"BlockyBoy by Matt Furie","id":"blockyboy-by-matt-furie","symbol":"blockyboy","description":"Blocky Boy wasn’t born to fit in—he was born to stand out. In a world of sleek logos, futuristic promises, and overpolished whitepapers, he arrived jagged, pixelated, and unapologetically rough around the edges. And that was his superpower. While other tokens talked about “bridging finance” and “enterprise adoption,” Blocky Boy just kept stacking. Each block he placed wasn’t just another pixel—it was another meme, another inside joke, another piece of culture cemented forever on-chain. The higher he stacked, the stronger he became. He wasn’t fast, but he was immovable. Scammers tried to rugpull in his presence, and their liquidity instantly froze, bricked over by his chunky fists. Influencers tried to spread FUD, but their words bounced right off his 8-bit armor. Blocky Boy wasn’t here to argue—he was here to block. And the community loved it. Holders didn’t see him as just a meme; they saw him as a protector. A guardian of vibes. A living reminder that crypto didn’t have to be sleek to be strong—it just had to stack, one block at a time. Legend says that whenever you see green candles that look like a perfect staircase, Blocky Boy is stacking himself higher. And when the market dips? He doesn’t fall—he just builds a stronger foundation. Blocky Boy isn’t promising to change the world. He’s promising to block, stack, and vibe—forever.","links":"https://www.blockyboy.vip/","market_cap":598700,"market_cap_rank":4874,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/blockyboy-by-matt-furie/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x76b6f7bd8857195c5165a49a6ff75f84a3f081ca","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x76b6f7bd8857195c5165a49a6ff75f84a3f081ca"}}}
