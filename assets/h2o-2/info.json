{"name":"H2O","id":"h2o-2","symbol":"h2o","description":"The Hydration Omnipool is a novel type of AMM which concentrates all liquidity in a single trading pool, thus unlocking an array of efficiencies. This doc contains a mathematical specification of the mechanics which power the Omnipool. The Omnipool uses H2O as a \"hub\" token through which all trades are routed, avoiding the segmentation of liquidity inherent to AMMs which require LPs to provide liquidity for a pair of tokens. Both transaction fees and partial impermanent loss mitigation are paid out in H2O.","links":"https://app.hydration.net/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/h2o-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"hydration":{"decimal_place":12,"contract_address":"asset_registry%2F1"}}}
