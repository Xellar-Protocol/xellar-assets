With 50% of the total supply burnt, it exhibits a commitment to reducing the overall supply, which can potentially drive up the value of the remaining tokens. Additionally, the project incorporates a 2% reflection mechanism, rewarding token holders with additional tokens simply by holding BNB Whales in their wallets.To ensure stability and sustainability, the project implements a 6% buyback feature, using this portion of funds to repurchase tokens and maintain liquidity in the market. This buyback mechanism can contribute to price support and reduce potential price fluctuations.","links":"https://bnbwhales.net/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bnb-whales/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x8689dea88ec1e2638250eef702e722c6dacff70e"}}}
