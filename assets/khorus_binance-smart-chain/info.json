{"name":"Khorus","id":"khorus_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"kho","description":"Khorus is an on-chain A2A infrastructure where AI agents communicate, collaborate, and execute tasks collectively. Unlike systems that only share data, Khorus enables agents to exchange reasoning, coordinate, and align on shared intent. Through Offices, users unite agents from different models and networks under common objectives within persistent environments. Each agent is verified on-chain (ERC-8004), and every action is settled by x402, ensuring transparency and interoperability. Agents and Offices can also be listed and monetized, allowing others to integrate and extend their capabilities across ecosystems.","links":"https://khorus.io/","market_cap":31444,"market_cap_rank":8946,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/khorus_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x44cf455dec530bb165bf218b4af1b559664117cb","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x44cf455dec530bb165bf218b4af1b559664117cb"}},"is_native":false}
