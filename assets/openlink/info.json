{"name":"OpenLink","id":"openlink","symbol":"olink","description":"The vision of OLINK Eco is to create the underlying ecological architecture of the blockchain industry. The mission of OLINK Eco is to provide a more efficient service for developers and applicators. OLINK Ecology relies on the core technologies of layering, fragmentation and modularity to improve the scalability, security and efficiency of the OLINK Ecology framework. And through the establishment of OW visualisation tools, infinite possibilities are created for the establishment of a prosperous OL INK ecology. OLINK ecology proposes the \"ultimate decentralisation approach and DAO autonomy model\" as the two core realisation paths for the development and construction of OLINK ecology. The technology, data, transactions and organisation are all open to the DAO community, thus creating a free, compatible and democratic community of high-precision DAO organisations in which everyone can participate. Everyone is a participant, builder and contributor to the OLINK DAO ecology, and will work together to promote the prosperity of the OLINK ecology and DAO community.","links":"https://open-link.co/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/openlink/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":null}}}
