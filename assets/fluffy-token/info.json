{"name":"Fluffy Token","id":"fluffy-token","symbol":"$fluffy","description":"What is the project about? FLUFFY is the ERC-20 native token of the Fluffytopia ecosystem, a play-and-earn web platform based on a fantasy universe. The FLUFFY token is used to interact with the different elements of the platform. What makes your project unique? The FLUFFY token is unique due to its utility directly linked to the Fluffytopia platform. This token is at the heart of Fluffytopia, being used both to play and to be rewarded on this platform. History of your project. The Fluffytopia project first started with two NFT collections, named \"Fluffers\" and \"Fluffylands\", both minted in January and February 2023. These two collections helped to establish the imaginary world that is Fluffytopia. The web platform was then launched on Monday March 20, 2023, along with its $FLUFFY token. Whatâ€™s next for your project? After the TGE of the $FLUFFY token and the opening of Fluffytopia on March 20, 2023, new features will be added periodically to the platform. The launch of new gamified mechanisms and elements to be used in this P2E is already planned for the first weeks. The tokenomics of the $FLUFFY token and the circular economy mechanisms implemented on the web platform make it possible for its token to keep its value on the long term and for new features to be implemented according to what its community wants. What can your token be used for? The FLUFFY token can be used to acquire on-chain game items and to be staked on the Fluffytopia platform.","links":"https://fluffytopia.wtf/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/fluffy-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc2a2e9b87b37938d934fd51cfec0c5fd5cb14c31"}}}
