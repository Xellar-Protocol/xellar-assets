{"name":"Checkmate","id":"checkmate-2_ethereum","symbol":"check","description":"Chess remains one of the most widely played and culturally significant games in history. With over 605.0 million players globally and over $2.5 billion in market value, its recent resurgence, driven by digital platforms, live streaming, and global accessibility, has brought the game to new audiences. Yet despite this momentum, the digital chess experience has remained largely unchanged. It continues to be the same game, with the same rules and mechanics. Anichess looks to modernize chess and reimagine the timeless game. By integrating spell-based mechanics, digital ownership, and player-driven governance, it reimagines chess as an interactive, evolving ecosystem. Anichess transforms the game as a new title that looks to advance chess adoption, giving seasoned players a twist to the game they love and empowering newer players by giving them an even playing field to enter the game and test their skills.","links":"https://anichess.com/","market_cap":4908518,"market_cap_rank":2087,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/checkmate-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x9126236476efba9ad8ab77855c60eb5bf37586eb","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x9126236476efba9ad8ab77855c60eb5bf37586eb"}},"is_native":false}
