{"name":"AgentiPy","id":"agentipy","symbol":"apy","description":"The Python toolkit for connecting AI agents to any onchain app. 🐍 $APY is the community token powering Agentic Apps development in Python. We’re on a mission to connect AI agents coded in Python to any onchain app starting with @Solana. We released our open-source toolkit and got a lot of attention from AI/ML developers. We truly believe in the future of AI x Blockchain. Every agent will be onchain and call it home. For more agents to be onchain, more languages need to be supported. Python is the most popular language used in AI/ML and $APY will enable devs to do more actions onchain.","links":"https://agentipy.fun/","market_cap":1203854,"market_cap_rank":3438,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/agentipy/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"yLUD35WTiPLEY6DUqEj5W2JVXF2DfKB5arPkKJXpump"}}}
