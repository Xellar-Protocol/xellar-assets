{"name":"DAMA","id":"dama","symbol":"dama","description":"YCS DAO is an NFT Metaverse P2E project where our DAMA token will be used as an in-game currency for our upcoming P2E game. Users can earn DAMA token by staking their YCS NFTs and with DAMA, can recruit our second generation NFTs. Other utilities for DAMA are being built out with the game prototype scheduled to be released at the end of Q3 2022. YCS NFTs will be used as in-game characters for the upcoming game. DAMA tokenomics are also created to help incentivize users. An initial burning mechanism for all DAMA used to recruit our YCS Killer Cats with additional burn mechanisms in the future will help to keep the token deflationary.","links":"https://ycsdao.com/dama","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dama/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x2c0da41c89adb5a1d4430e5761b9b400911426b0"}}}
