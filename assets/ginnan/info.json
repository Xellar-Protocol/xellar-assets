{"name":"Ginnan","id":"ginnan","symbol":"ginnan","description":"The Rise of Ginnan – The First-Ever Deployed OG Token Ginnan is not just another meme coin; it’s the OG, the community-led symbol of meme culture, and the “brother” to both Doge and Neiro. Launched on Dec 18, 2023, Ginnan became a fully community-owned movement after the dev sold out, cementing its place as a cult-like legacy. With imitators attempting to replicate its success, only Ginnan holds the authentic spirit as the true community-driven token. Join the movement, embrace the original, and reject the fakes. The future of meme coins belongs to Ginnan!","links":"https://ginnan.io","market_cap":92212,"market_cap_rank":7589,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ginnan/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x50d7ee9708fec39673c92e1aae048eb3685eea9b","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x50d7ee9708fec39673c92e1aae048eb3685eea9b"}}}
