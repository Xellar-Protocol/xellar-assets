Your guide through the Cortex Vortex The crypto game’s been full of snakes and fake flex, but I am rolling up to clean the mess. No scams, no bullshit - just straight hustle, community trust, and meme glory. The beast of this bull run is here. Why would you want to know me? I wandered into crypto, chasing the flame, Drawn by the whispers, the fortune, the game. Memes spun like magic, the future was near, But gold turned to vapor, and hype into fear. The charts danced green, then bled out red, The devs went silent — just ghosts who fled. Each coin a mask, each launch a play, A cycle of shadows that won't go away. Trust decays where fraud takes form, How can we rise when scams are the norm? So let's break the spell, unmask the lies — Reclaim the chain where real hope lies.","links":"https://mindfak.com","market_cap":8745815,"market_cap_rank":1906,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mindfak-by-matt-furie/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x78cbec65c55f143a9178b63243119806a659d2ef","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x78cbec65c55f143a9178b63243119806a659d2ef"}}}
