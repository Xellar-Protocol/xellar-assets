{"name":"Energy Dollar","id":"energy-dollar_solana","symbol":"energy","description":"Electricity demand has reached unprecedented levels, and our infrastructure is struggling to keep up. Grids were built for the last century, not for AI data centres, or transport electrification. Limited capacity means our grids now experience severe network congestion during times of peak demand. The result is systemic inefficiency: volatile energy prices, decade-long delays to connect new sites to the grid, and stranded cheap power. The Energy Network is engineered to scale our energy grids. The network connects homes and distributed devices such as EV chargers, home batteries, and solar panels with energy flexibility markets. Participants shift energy usage to reduce grid network congestion, improving the price of energy and grid reliability. For their contributions, participants earn the project’s native utility token, Energy Dollars ($ENERGY), which can then be burned to unlock discounts on products and services in the ecosystem.","links":"https://www.fuseenergy.com/energy-network","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/energy-dollar/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"ENERGYi1ApwBAtGLKaeLZ4hRGMuPu1EG8PQTV4EDqFsW","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/ENERGYi1ApwBAtGLKaeLZ4hRGMuPu1EG8PQTV4EDqFsW"}},"is_native":false}
