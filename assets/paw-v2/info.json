{"name":"Paw V2","id":"paw-v2","symbol":"paw","description":"Polycat Finance launched May 2021 as a yield farm and yield aggregator. Since then it's expanded to become a hybrid yield optimizer: with yield aggregation (Vaults), decentralized exchange (DEX) and launchpad for ecosystem projects. Polycat is built on Ethereum's EVM and Solidity smart contracts, powered by Polygon Network's Layer 2 scalability and infrastructure. By utilizing L2 for transactions, Polycat's users can trade, invest and farm cryptoassets instantly, with close to zero gas/transaction costs. Polycat is currently only accessible on the Polygon blockchain. What is the PAW token? PAW is the protocol's DEX reward token with an infinite max supply. PAW can be staked in liquidity pairs or pools (tanks) for rewards. PAW rewards from farming are vested, linearly unlocking over a 30-day period.","links":"https://polycat.finance/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/paw-v2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xbc5b59ea1b6f8da8258615ee38d40e999ec5d74f"}}}
