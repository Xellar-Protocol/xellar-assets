{"name":"T A O S","id":"t-a-o-s_base","symbol":"taos","description":"T.A.O.S. — Autonomous Oracle System T.A.O.S. is an autonomous AI-powered oracle system designed to monitor, interpret, and publish real-time data from the decentralised subnet structure of the Bittensor network. Designed as an intelligence guardian, this system continuously scans changes in subnets and shares its structured, human-readable insights directly via Twitter. By combining on-chain data from platforms like Taostats.io with algorithmic anomaly detection, T.A.O.S. enables users, developers, and investors to observe the network's evolving dynamics—from stake flows to miner rewards, new token listings, and sudden activity spikes—without diving into complex dashboards or manually collecting data. 🌐 What does T.A.O.S. do? Monitors live subnet activity: T.A.O.S. tracks validator and miner activity, stake inflows/outflows, subnet rewards, performance changes, and registry changes across all active subnets. Detects anomalies and trends: Using statistical techniques and AI prediction models to be integrated soon, it detects unusual subnet behaviour such as sudden volume increases or reward imbalances. Important information: Of course, keep in mind that the bot cannot perform graphical analysis, so graphical analysis is performed by a human.","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/t-a-o-s_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x68c83304d5e348b392a2fd542f56dddbac03a984","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x68c83304d5e348b392a2fd542f56dddbac03a984"}},"is_native":false}
