It's highlighted by the Gorilla Pad, an IDO launchpad that allows token projects to conduct presales with no upfront fees. They offer a suite of tools including whitelists, vesting, claims, refunds, and liquidity pool (LP) locking, aiming to establish trust through doxxing, KYC procedures, and audits. Their platform also features an affiliate program and a low tax rate on sales, supporting the $GORILLA ecosystem through buybacks and marketing efforts. Additionally, the project presents the Gorilla Swap, a service enabling users to perform cross-chain trades with unique features like a stop-loss limit and AI technology to mirror top traders' strategies. It also supports smooth transitions across different blockchains. The Gorilla project's NFT initiative, #MGUC, offers the \"Mad Gorilla\" NFT collection, limited to 3,333 pieces minted on the Ethereum blockchain, with staking benefits that allow earning $BANANAS. The roadmap includes strategic marketing through various platforms, listing on BITMART, and development plans for new functionalities and exclusive NFT launches. The project promotes its services with an active presence on social media and crypto listing sites, indicating a dynamic approach to community engagement and market presence.","links":"http://gorillatoken.io/","market_cap":1200740,"market_cap_rank":3758,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gorilla/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x33c04bed4533e31f2afb8ac4a61a48eda38c4fa0"}}}
