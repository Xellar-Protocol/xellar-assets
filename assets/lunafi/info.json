{"name":"Lunafi","id":"lunafi","symbol":"lfi","description":"LunaFi is the DeFi betting protocol where you become the house. By harnessing the power of the decentralized technologies, community governance, and autonomous smart contracts — we allow users to securely place peerless bets in a trustless, non-custodial gambling platform that is set to revolutionize the global sports betting industry by allowing the player to invest and become the house. To facilitate this, we provide a complete multichain DeFi platform designed to enable the integration of sports betting and prediction markets, powered by a community-owned liquidity pool known as a House Pool. This suite can be integrated by developers looking to add peerless betting functionalities to their dApps — the first of which will be LunaFi’s own dApp, Lunabets, a decentralized sports book application. In turn, these dApps empower individuals and communities with safe and equitable gambling experiences, operating on a secure infrastructure layer that is transparent, cannot be influenced by centralized entities, where odds are autonomously optimized in line with the market and all outcomes are verifiable on-chain.","links":"https://lunafi.io/","market_cap":6194.83,"market_cap_rank":5808,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/lunafi/logo.png","detail_platform":{"sx-network":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x4c882ec256823ee773b25b414d36f92ef58a7c0c"},"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x77d97db5615dfe8a2d16b38eaa3f8f34524a0a74"},"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb28f803a8772e6584a65ab6dfc535ae6fef8a0b2"}}}
