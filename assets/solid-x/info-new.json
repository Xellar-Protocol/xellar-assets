{"name":"Solid X","id":"solid-x","symbol":"solidx","description":"Hi there, This is my token. I was rank #8 on the Pulsechain sacrifice list. I was rank #1 on the 9inch sacrifice list. The hexscout.com developers named me the fire whale as seen under the Portfolio tab. I strongly believe in Richard Heart's end-game plan, and I have enough courage and patience to get there. If you share similar thoughts, take a leap of faith and join us! This is a Solid token with the same supply as Bitcoin (21.000.000). My guess is that the people who know me and bought this token, are also diamond handed. This token is intended to be a store of value for the Pulsechain community.","links":"https://solidx.win/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/solid-x/logo.png","detail_platform":{"pulsechain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8da17db850315a34532108f0f5458fc0401525f6"}}}
