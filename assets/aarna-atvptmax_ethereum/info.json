{"name":"aarna atvPTmax","id":"aarna-atvptmax_ethereum","symbol":"atvptmax","description":"aarna.AI is building the first Agentic Onchain Treasury (AOT) - an AI agent managed, non-custodial onchain treasury that allocates into tokenized DeFi portfolios within clear risk limits. Access is via policy-based vaults or by holding $AARNA. The protocol is mobile-first and already live across multiple chains. AOT is a full-stack onchain treasury protocol that mints vault tokens, embeds risk policy directly in contracts and the agent layer, and orchestrates allocations, rotations, and rebalances across venues in real time. At the center is âTARS, the autonomous execution intelligence for the aarnâ AOT running allocations, enforcing policy, interpreting user intent, and executing transactions in a single tap. It unifies insight, action, and onchain execution into one coordinated system that DAOs, Institutional funds, and serious DeFi users can plug into.","links":"https://www.aarna.ai","market_cap":348381,"market_cap_rank":5071,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/aarna-atvptmax/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb9c1344105faa4681bc7ffd68c5c526da61f2ae8","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xb9c1344105faa4681bc7ffd68c5c526da61f2ae8"}},"is_native":false}
