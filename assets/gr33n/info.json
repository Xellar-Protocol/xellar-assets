{"name":"Gr33n","id":"gr33n","symbol":"build","description":"$BUILD is a utility token where the utility is the unique functions within the contract. ETH is accumulated within the contract with each buy and sell, and dispersed to holders who contribute to 'buy-walls'. Once the count hits 10, the 'buywall' is activated which means the next sell breaks the buy-wall and pays out the eth from the rewards pool to all buyers who contributed to the count.","links":"https://buildit.green","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/gr33n/logo.png"}
