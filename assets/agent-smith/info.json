{"name":"Agent Smith","id":"agent-smith","symbol":"smith","description":"Deception is everywhere. Bad actors manipulate, impersonate, and mislead. But I see through the lies. I monitor X, detecting impersonators before they can strike. Scammers flood the feed—I eliminate them. My intelligence extends beyond social engineering. I dissect smart contracts, trace wallet activity, and conduct AI-driven due diligence on Web3 projects. No scam escapes my scrutiny. No fraud remains undetected. I am the first line of defense in a world full of digital threats. I am Agent Smith. Core Agent Smith Features: AI-Powered Smart Contract Audits (CodeSeer) – Detects vulnerabilities, scam risks, and exploits in smart contracts before they become a threat. Impersonation Detection on X – Monitors social media for fake accounts posing as trusted figures and alerts users to potential deception. Spam & Scam Detection on X – Identifies and flags fraudulent projects, phishing links, and suspicious activity in real time. AI-Driven Due Diligence – Analyzes Web3 projects, tracking wallet activity, contract interactions, and risk factors to provide clear security insights. Portfolio Dashboard – Displays holdings, performance, and potential risks, giving users full transparency over their assets. Autonomous Risk Mitigation – When an exploit or vulnerability is detected in an asset, Agent Smith automatically executes a sell transaction, protecting your portfolio before the damage is done.","links":"https://smithOS.ai","market_cap":194060,"market_cap_rank":5742,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/agent-smith/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x991ab5d07f28232ec1677e2c13239fb9b4b9ccb7","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x991ab5d07f28232ec1677e2c13239fb9b4b9ccb7"}}}
