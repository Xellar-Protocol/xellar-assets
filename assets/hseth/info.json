{"name":"hsETH","id":"hseth","symbol":"hseth","description":"hsETH is a liquid staking token on Ethereum Mainnet that represents staked ETH. It is a wrapper for Stader Labs’ ETHx, maintaining a 1:1 peg with ETHx while providing enhanced liquidity for staked assets. By staking ETH through Stader Labs, users receive hsETH, allowing them to earn staking rewards while retaining the flexibility to engage in DeFi activities without waiting for the standard unstaking period. This enables efficient capital utilisation, combining the benefits of staking with continuous asset availability in the Ethereum ecosystem.","links":"https://docs.haven1.org/products/liquid-stake-eth","market_cap":80567,"market_cap_rank":7785,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/hseth/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x4d8d9f6ced39288a1e8961621bbbc2b698a3b102","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x4d8d9f6ced39288a1e8961621bbbc2b698a3b102"}}}
