{"name":"Pepes Dog","id":"pepes-dog","symbol":"zeus","description":"$ZEUS is based on Pepe the Dog, a deep-cut character from Matt Furie’s Boy’s Club comics. Not a copy, not a clone — a real piece of Pepe lore. He’s the silent protector, the swamp’s secret guardian, the underdog watching from the shadows while frogs and cheems hog the limelight. Now he’s stepping out of the background and onto the blockchain. This isn’t just another memecoin. It’s a resurrection. A narrative play. A cultural callback to the roots of meme history — with paws on the ground and eyes on Olympus.","links":"https://www.zeuscoin.vip/","market_cap":13857593,"market_cap_rank":1356,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pepes-dog/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x0f7dc5d02cc1e1f5ee47854d534d332a1081ccc8"}}}
