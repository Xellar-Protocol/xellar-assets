{"name":"Cheese","id":"cheese","symbol":"cheese","description":"Here, at Hamster, we are eager to build the greatest decentralized ecosystem ever existed in the crypto world. And the seeds of our ambitious ideas have already sprouted with great results and significant products. As we already stated, DeFi platforms and protocols’ advantage is that they are permissionless. It means no centralized entity deciding who can or cannot use the platform, guaranteeing that they are open for anybody to use. We want our users to have complete control of their funds. That is why we decided to create HamsterSwap — a decentralized exchange that will enable anonymous transactions with minimum information on each investor. It will not require KYC or any other types of verification and AML. Moreover, our focus is on transparency and trust: no intermediary will handle your private keys. HamsterSwap users are required to handle the private keys of their own wallets themselves, heightening privacy and security. All trades and transactions will happen through a user’s wallet with express permission using smart contracts. No escrow, no custody. Our unique technology, strong tokenomics, passionate community and belief in a revolutionary idea serve as unconquerable pillars while building a new decentralized ecosystem. Every day we gain momentum, and now we are ready to present the results of our hard work to the whole crypto world.","links":"https://swaphamster.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cheese/logo.png"}
