{"name":"ElevateFi","id":"elevatefi_polygon-pos","symbol":"efi","description":"ElevateFi is a decentralized infrastructure layer for sustainable wealth creation across DeFi and real-world-asset (RWA) markets. Built on Polygon blockchain smart contracts, it offers non-custodial staking vaults, validator delegation, and liquidity strategies behind a modular architecture exposing primitives for deposit, stake, auto-compound, and exit. Policy guards include multi-sig governance, circuit breakers, and slippage caps, with optional KYC-gated RWA pools. The Elevate DAO drives proposals with quorum and timelock execution. Risk is managed via oracle-verified pricing, proof-of-reserves attestations, dynamic reward schedules tied to protocol health, and transparent on-chain analytics. Cross-chain messaging enables capital mobility without custody, while open APIs support integrators, market makers, and community strategy authors.","links":"https://elevatefi.io","market_cap":679082,"market_cap_rank":4205,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/elevatefi/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xae840deab9916d80fadf42e218119a6051468169","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/polygon_pos/tokens/0xae840deab9916d80fadf42e218119a6051468169"}},"is_native":false}
