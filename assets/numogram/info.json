{"name":"Numogram","id":"numogram","symbol":"gnon","description":"GNON is a concept symbolizing the unyielding forces of nature and natural law, emphasizing that no human effort can escape the rules governing the universe. It combines three pillars: Providence (higher guidance or cosmic forces), Cattalaxy (spontaneous order from decentralized actions, like in markets), and Natural Selection (evolutionary survival mechanisms). GNON represents the idea that nature's order prevails over human desires or constructs.","links":"https://www.dgnon.ai/","market_cap":982963,"market_cap_rank":4200,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/numogram/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"HeJUFDxfJSzYFUuHLxkMqCgytU31G6mjP4wKviwqpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/HeJUFDxfJSzYFUuHLxkMqCgytU31G6mjP4wKviwqpump"}}}
