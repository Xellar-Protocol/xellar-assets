{"name":"TAIKI INU","id":"taiki-inu","symbol":"taiki","description":"$TAIKI is a community-driven meme token honoring one of the earliest and most iconic Shiba Inu images on the internet — a 2008 public domain photo of Taiki, taken by Italian photographer Roberto Vasarri. The project aims to preserve a piece of meme and internet history by putting Taiki “on-chain.” It has no presale, no team allocation, and no tax — 100% fair launch, fully decentralized, and owned by the community.","links":"https://taikiinu.io/","market_cap":541672,"market_cap_rank":4406,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/taiki-inu/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe533c2480983e46664b15717d6fc02c0a1dad537","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xe533c2480983e46664b15717d6fc02c0a1dad537"}}}
