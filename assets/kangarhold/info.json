{"name":"Kangarhold","id":"kangarhold","symbol":"kanga","description":"Kangarhold is a meme-inspired crypto ecosystem built around the character KangaRHold (“Kanga” = short form; “Ranger” + “Hold”). The project explores internet culture through short-form video content such as funny animal moments, pranks, riddles, and gym clips published across its social channels. In addition to entertainment, Kangarhold actively collaborates with crypto-tools developing projects, including Anonymous Coding Cult (focused on Monero-based privacy tools) and supports early-stage blockchain projects, like a DEX tracker for Solana and Ethereum (to be launched). Revenue is generated through content, partnerships, and merchandise, then reinvested into platform development, token utility, awareness efforts, and community rewards.","links":"https://www.kangarhold.com/","market_cap":203842,"market_cap_rank":6413,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kangarhold/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"4yTZ41t1WUPJoEFwhmFFzrL3UbFWkdDRVUKJTtLwpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/4yTZ41t1WUPJoEFwhmFFzrL3UbFWkdDRVUKJTtLwpump"}}}
