{"name":"Codec Flow","id":"codec-flow_solana","symbol":"codec","description":"CodecFlow is the first Operator platform built on Vision-Language Actions (VLAs), enabling AI to see, reason, and act across screens or robotic systems. It includes Fabric, a multi-cloud execution layer for GPU-intensive or compute-heavy workloads. Fabric optimizes workload placement by sampling live capacity and pricing across connected providers and selecting the lowest-cost node that meets specified requirements. CodecFlow also developed Operator Kit (optr), a lightweight toolkit for building agents that operate on desktops, browsers, simulations, and robots. Optr provides composable utilities for managing actions, state, episodes, and safety, with a modular design that keeps other components pluggable. Together, these components form a framework that supports the development and deployment of agents across diverse digital and physical environments","links":"https://codecflow.ai/","market_cap":5287294,"market_cap_rank":2026,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/codec-flow_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"69LjZUUzxj3Cb3Fxeo1X4QpYEQTboApkhXTysPpbpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/69LjZUUzxj3Cb3Fxeo1X4QpYEQTboApkhXTysPpbpump"}},"is_native":false}
