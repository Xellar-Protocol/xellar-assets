{"name":"Boson","id":"boson-protocol_base","symbol":"boson","description":"The decentralized commerce layer of the agentic economy. Trade any asset between any agent, anywhere—from everyday commerce to high-value RWAs. We have solved the hard problems of decentralized commerce, so you can easily enable any agent to exchange any asset, verifiably, with low fees. Our no-code, low-cost tools make it easy to start decentralized agentic commerce in just a few clicks. With Boson dACP you can enable any agent to exchange any asset through the decentralized commerce layer of the agent stack—providing MCP-compatible infrastructure that integrates seamlessly with existing agent frameworks. Agents can autonomously handle everything from everyday purchases to high-value transactions, giving you full control of the commerce experience. Buyers can delegate purchasing to agents who benefit from secure, verifiable exchange guarantees. Agents can autonomously buy, transfer, or trade assets—ensuring buyers either receive the item or get their money back—all without needing to trust intermediaries or sellers, just code and independent dispute resolvers. Boson dACP is foundational infrastructure for decentralized agentic commerce and has been awarded Technology Pioneer status by the World Economic Forum. As a decentralized protocol, Boson is built for the benefit of and governed by its users. Consequently, Boson only charges minimal fees per transaction—designed to be minimally extractive.","links":"http://bosonprotocol.io","market_cap":4442791,"market_cap_rank":2175,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/boson-protocol_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x2192607c3cba9ec3d490206d10d831e68e5f3c97","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x2192607c3cba9ec3d490206d10d831e68e5f3c97"}},"is_native":false}
