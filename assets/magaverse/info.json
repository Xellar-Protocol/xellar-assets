{"name":"Magaverse","id":"magaverse","symbol":"mvrs","description":"MVRS is a community-driven token built on the Solana blockchain, designed to represent resilience, unity, and a shared vision for the future. Initially launched on Pump.fun, the project faced challenges due to the actions of its original developer, who dumped their holdings. The community stepped in to reclaim and rebuild the token, creating a narrative of collective strength and leadership. With a total supply of 1 billion tokens and 100% of the circulating supply distributed, MVRS emphasizes transparency and trust. Its liquidity is secured, with a significant portion burned to maintain value stability. The project also seeks to establish a cultural movement inspired by themes of progress, resilience, and pride. MVRS operates on the Solana blockchain, leveraging its fast and low-cost transaction capabilities to provide users with a seamless experience. The token aims to foster a community of individuals who believe in strength, innovation, and the potential of decentralized technologies to drive meaningful change.","links":"https://mvrs.wtf","market_cap":120009,"market_cap_rank":6365,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/magaverse/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"6dk9H7RD5m8JtRuUErNztwhBbr5ynzWvzPTusLpxpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/6dk9H7RD5m8JtRuUErNztwhBbr5ynzWvzPTusLpxpump"}}}
