{"name":"Bonk Index","id":"bonk-index_solana","symbol":"bnkk","description":"Bonk Index - $BNKK is an index token for the BONK ecosystem on Solana. 100% of creator fees are recycled back into the community by buying BONK ecosystem tokens such as $BONK, $DEBT, and $BNKK itself, then depositing them into staking pools. Holders simply stake $BNKK once to earn rewards across multiple tokens, gaining diversified exposure to the ecosystem. The project emphasizes transparency, with all fees, token purchases, and pool deposits logged on-chain and made visible through a public dashboard. This model turns what is usually developer profit into community rewards, boosting both BNKK stakers and the wider BONK economy.","links":"https://bnkk.fun/","market_cap":6715.67,"market_cap_rank":11915,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bonk-index/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"BP95AFpABStmiAo5En9a9RXXQoqq5xKSfdaNu2ETbonk","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/BP95AFpABStmiAo5En9a9RXXQoqq5xKSfdaNu2ETbonk"}},"is_native":false}
