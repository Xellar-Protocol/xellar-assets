{"name":"Shikoku Inu","id":"shikoku-inu-2_ethereum","symbol":"shik","description":"Shikoku Inu, also known as the $SHIK token, is inspired by the Shikoku dog breed, a legendary medium-sized hunting dog originating from the rugged, mountainous island of Shikoku, Japan. Known for their sharp instincts, agility, and fierce loyalty, Shikoku Inu dogs were historically used for hunting large game, particularly wild boars and deer. Their agility and intelligence made them excellent hunters, able to navigate the dense forests of Shikoku and work closely with their handlers to track and capture prey. These qualities—bravery, loyalty, and adaptability—are the core values embedded into the $SHIK token, creating a unique synergy between nature and modern technology.","links":"https://shikokudog.fun","market_cap":3689.53,"market_cap_rank":12751,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/shikoku-inu-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xf480f819766c024defc0e8a333b324350174ff71","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xf480f819766c024defc0e8a333b324350174ff71"}},"is_native":false}
