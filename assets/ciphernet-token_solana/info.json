{"name":"CipherNet Token","id":"ciphernet-token_solana","symbol":"cinet","description":"CipherNet is a Web3 privacy engine built for zero-footprint exploration. Ephemeral wallets, auto-burn sessions, encrypted dApp isolation, and a built-in MSG mask mixer that breaks every trace of your on-chain flow. No trails, no links, just pure anonymity. CipherNet is a privacy network that wraps every action inside an ephemeral identity. You can mix funds, send privately, test dApps, simulate flows and communicate without exposing your real wallet. Every session begins with a clean identity and ends in a complete wipe. Nothing can be reconstructed.","links":"https://ciphernetsol.xyz/","market_cap":125589,"market_cap_rank":6633,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ciphernet-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"3qAR4mq5X8WTuyqDeie2Mj9wGrYVb83TiGdkEgYbpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/3qAR4mq5X8WTuyqDeie2Mj9wGrYVb83TiGdkEgYbpump"}},"is_native":false}
