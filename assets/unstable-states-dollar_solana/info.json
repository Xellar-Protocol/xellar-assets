{"name":"Unstable States Dollar","id":"unstable-states-dollar_solana","symbol":"usd","description":"$USD The Unstable Dollar The only dollar that embraces chaos. $USD is a community-led meme coin that turns the concept of stability on its head. In a world where fiat is shaky and “stablecoins” are anything but, $USD proudly leans into volatility. It’s not trying to stay at $1 it’s daring the community to re-peg it through pure meme power and market energy. Already aligned with the BONK ecosystem and featuring Nom (co-founder of Let’s BONK) as a top holder. The mission is simple: build infrastructure, rally the troops, and push $USD toward becoming the official unstable coin of crypto. Why $USD? Meme-first, mission-powered, BONK ecosystem synergy, ATH of $2M still very early Narrative-driven: the ultimate re-peg challenge Now with a committed CTO building with the community This isn’t your average stablecoin. This is $USD. Volatile by design.","links":"https://www.usdbonk.xyz/","market_cap":12255.41,"market_cap_rank":10758,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/unstable-states-dollar_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"7WXaHLjatDZBAZ7hyRiFpYpGpPbcKiyHf6HaxUzSbonk","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/7WXaHLjatDZBAZ7hyRiFpYpGpPbcKiyHf6HaxUzSbonk"}},"is_native":false}
