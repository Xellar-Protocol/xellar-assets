A scarce NFT (e.g. Art, Collectible, Virtual Real Estate, In-Game Item, etc.) can now be transformed into a basket holding a number of other tokens. The Principal amount can be time-locked inside the NFT, and through integration with Aaveâ€™s aTokens, the programmable yield from these DeFi yield-generating assets is just a few clicks away.","links":"https://charged.fi/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/charged-particles/logo.png"}
