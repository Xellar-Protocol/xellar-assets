{"name":"Joe-Yo Coin","id":"joe-yo-coin","symbol":"jyc","description":"The Joe-Yo Coin is a crypto project that focuses on creating none-fungible tokens. With the help of NFT, the team tries to warn society about a huge problem. Kids are just playing with smartphones and don’t go outside. Also, texting while driving is six times more likely to cause an accident than drunk driving. Therefore, the project wants to inspire people to play outdoor games and sports instead of wasting time on smartphones. JYC is a BEP20 (BSC) token with 10% taxation. So, the coin’s contract takes ten percent from each transaction. 5% goes to the existing token-holders. Then, 4% goes to marketing. The rest, 1%, goes to the burning address. Besides, the developers have locked liquidity on the Pancake until August 2023.","links":"https://joeyocoin.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/joe-yo-coin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x13b8abb1cfd7bbe1f5764fe967ed049d488d9d1d"}}}
