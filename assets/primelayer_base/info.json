{"name":"PrimeLayer","id":"primelayer_base","symbol":"prml","description":"PrimeLayer is a flexible and future proof BTC Layer 2 that represents a paradigm shift in modular Bitcoin design. It merges the security of Bitcoin, the programmability of Ethereum, and the scalability and speed of ZK-rollups to offer the first truly compromise-free, production-ready Bitcoin Layer 2. PrimeLayer avoids the pitfalls of competitors by rooting its state data to the Bitcoin blockchain using AuxPow tags rather than public block space witness field data- making it a truly future proof solution, regardless of how large the Bitcoin ecosystem and public block space competition becomes. PrimeLayer: BTCFi without compromise.","links":"https://primelayernetwork.com","market_cap":560683,"market_cap_rank":4437,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/primelayer/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xfb1b73a861104b36049d1b6c0a0eb76a608ce5f7","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xfb1b73a861104b36049d1b6c0a0eb76a608ce5f7"}},"is_native":false}
