{"name":"ECOx","id":"ecox","symbol":"ecox","description":"Eco is a cryptocurrency with independent monetary policy, designed to evolve and support a growing Economy. Eco’s design is informed by the following assumptions: Given better economic data and a more transparent incentive structure for governance, it is possible to govern and grow a currency that is digitally-native and more clearly aligned with its users’ best interests. Within the Eco Currency system, there are two tokens. $ECO is the currency itself — governed by its community, with the goal of building an independent currency for saving and spending. $ECOx is the secondary token meant to bootstrap governance and liquidity for the system.","links":"https://eco.org","market_cap":27769844,"market_cap_rank":728,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ecox/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xcccd1ba9f7acd6117834e0d28f25645decb1736a"}}}
