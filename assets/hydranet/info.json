{"name":"Hydranet","id":"hydranet","symbol":"hdn","description":"What Is Hydranet (HDN)? Hydranet is a web3 crypto wallet that integrates a unique decentralized exchange (DEX), offering trustless, peer-to-peer trading with instant trade confirmations and no network fees, even across different blockchains. Using Hydranet, traders no longer need to deposit their funds to centralized exchanges (CEX) and risk their security. Instead, they can trade directly on Hydranet, benefiting from similar capabilities as on CEXs but maintaining full control of their private keys. Hydranet leverages and combines off-chain protocols such as the Lightning Network for Bitcoin and Hydranet’s Lithium Network for EVM and smart contract-based blockchains. Off-chain protocols enable transaction processing outside the blockchain, allowing users to conduct multiple transactions without recording every single one on the blockchain. This approach reduces transaction costs, improves scalability and speeds up transaction confirmations, addressing some of the key limitations of on-chain transactions (high fees and network congestion). This is how Hydranet offers decentralized trading with instant trade confirmations and no network fees. Hydranet is designed for everyone, offering multiple trading interfaces. Casual traders can use a user-friendly interface similar to popular DEXs for a simplified one-click trading experience, while experienced traders can opt for an order book interface or API, providing greater flexibility for advanced trading strategies. Beyond its key features - instant trades, zero network fees, and cross-blockchain trading - Hydranet introduces several innovations: the first-ever Lightning (and Lithium) off-chain nodes running directly in a browser, an external off-chain signer for secure off-chain transaction signing, and the Lithium protocol for off-chain EVM token transactions. Read more about Hydranet on their documentation page: https://docs.hydranet.ai/. What Powers Hydranet? Hydranet’s DEX is powered by the Hydranet Network, an infrastructure overseen by two key roles: Titans and Guardians. Titans are responsible for ensuring the network’s continuous operation by hosting the exchange’s order book and acting as the matchmaking engine for traders. Guardians, on the other hand, safeguard the integrity of the network by monitoring the behavior of both traders and Titans, ensuring compliance with the network’s rules, and penalizing violators as necessary. HDN token holders can participate in the Hydranet Network by collateralizing their tokens to run Titans or Guardians, and thereby contributing to the network's operations and security. What Makes Hydranet Unique? Hydranet offers an entirely new approach to solving the blockchain trilemma of security, scalability, and decentralization. While many decentralized projects turn to sidechains to address scalability, Hydranet takes a different route by using scalability protocols that run on top of established blockchains. Sidechains often lead to issues in DeFi, such as liquidity fragmentation and increased ecosystem complexity. By focusing on scalability protocols, Hydranet allows original chains like Bitcoin and Ethereum to scale without sacrificing liquidity, decentralization, or security. Hydranet doesn’t just enhance the scalability of these blockchains, it also connects them, enabling seamless cross-blockchain trading with full control, instant confirmations, and zero network fees!","links":"https://hydranet.ai/","market_cap":9001147,"market_cap_rank":1963,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/hydranet/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x3404149e9ee6f17fb41db1ce593ee48fbdcd9506"}}}
