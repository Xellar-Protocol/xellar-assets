{"name":"ZEUS10000","id":"zeus10000","symbol":"zeus10000","description":"ZEUS10000 was created by a group of developers that wished to create something contractually unique - without forking other contracts. ZEUS is a hyper deflationary token in that it burns tokens with every sell. Not only that, the amount of tokens burnt depends on the price impact meaning it's dynamic and anti-dump. This means the supply will continue erode, token scarcity will increase and so will holder investments. NFT sales will fund the first utility - the Zeus Bank whereby holders will be able to claim NFTs by burning tokens and stake NFTs to earn rewards. Zeus Bank will serve as a DAO whereby investment decisions will be made democratically both from the perspective of strategic capital and further utility.","links":"https://zeus10000.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/zeus10000/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":4,"contract_address":"0xcbc1aa6961b28cccb11e1cddd84ad8b42ec920b1"}}}
