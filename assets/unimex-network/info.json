{"name":"UniMex Network","id":"unimex-network","symbol":"umx","description":"UniMex is an innovative onchain margin-trading platform entirely contained within Uniswap. Which means that shorts/longs are directly executed on Uniswap, rather than through an offchain approach e.g. through a 0x relayer. Margin traders are charged fees which are disbursed to lenders as a reward for supplying liquidity to lending pools.","links":"https://unimex.network/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/unimex-network/logo.png"}
