How it Works ProtocolX uses strategically coordinated and planned variables to facilitate a protocol that all constantly and positively feeds into each other. Whether you simply want to buy PTX to enhance it and earn a daily APR or get into the depths of the ecosystem, ProtocolX serves every level of DeFi investor accordingly.
