{"name":"POP","id":"pop","symbol":"pop!","description":"POP is a platform that allows two projects to prove their partnership and allows one-sided Liquidity Pool funding in Uniswap by matching providers. The POP Token (POP) serves as both a DAO governance and incentive token by allowing users to receive rewards from the POP vault. In the future, the DAO, and thus POP holders, will be able to vote on which MLPs will be accepted into the POP marketplace, amongst other governance decisions regarding protocol development.","links":"https://pop.town/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pop/logo.png"}
