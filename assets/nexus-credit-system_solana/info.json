{"name":"Nexus Credit System","id":"nexus-credit-system_solana","symbol":"ncrs","description":"Nexus isn’t just a protocol where you can mine. It’s a digital society, where finance, communication, and creation all coexist in one open network. In traditional systems, money flows upward — to platforms, advertisers, and centralized authorities. In Nexus, value flows sideways — from person to person, peer to peer. Every post, every launch, every transaction recirculates through the ecosystem, strengthening it from within and growing the Nexus. This is what decentralization was always meant to be: a self-sustaining community, not a corporate product.","links":"https://projectnexus.world","market_cap":2861.4,"market_cap_rank":12938,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nexus-credit-system_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"8xTDsy1UFBYK1J37igAdwRDRqvgCEUJYe1QggFNApump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/8xTDsy1UFBYK1J37igAdwRDRqvgCEUJYe1QggFNApump"}},"is_native":false}
