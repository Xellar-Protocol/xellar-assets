{"name":"RECYCLING AI","id":"recycling-ai","symbol":"cycai","description":"RECYCLING AI is blockchain-based platform for converting waste and recyclables into real value — CYCAI token. RECYCLING AI Ecosystem connects people with companies and municipal services, and makes it possible to encourage citizens to exercise care with waste utilization. The current waste market operates based on an outdated scheme. Waste in most countries first goes to a landfill, and sorted only afterwards. However, to adequately cope with the large amount of garbage is difficult, and therefore most of it simply stays in the landfill. Landfills take up a lot of space, and contain untold quantities of useful recyclables that could be utilized. RECYCLING AI ecosystem Insufficient motivation is the main reason for improper waste disposal. We propose to reward people for every eco-friendly action. Every single piece of sorted garbage — such as discarded bottles, cola cans, or other packaging — will bring several coins to the person's account. You do not need to haul a bunch of metal coins, returned by a plastic bottles recycling automat, in your pocket; instead, simply and easily accumulate CYCAI token in your cryptocurrency account online.","links":"https://www.recycling-token.com","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/recycling-ai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xe5653d5795a2c0c3bb0532e028656b703c0be002"}}}
