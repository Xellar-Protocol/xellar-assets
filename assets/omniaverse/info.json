{"name":"OmniaVerse","id":"omniaverse","symbol":"omnia","description":"We are a group of makers who make cool and innovative blockchain products. We have been active builders in Minecraft community and like us there are a lot of minecraft build artists (Minecraft Builds). Now, Minecraft is just one platform, meta is another one that can house millions of artists too. This year, with emerging blockchain platforms and applications, we saw a need to build a platform for artists that create artwork, but this time on Multiverse supporting metaverses flavours like Minecraft and Meta powered by better/effective and economic blockchain providers such as Bitgert, Tron, Ethereum and Binance Chain. To make the experience even better, the platform would be integrated with Oculus for a seameless metaverse experience. So whether its imaginary or real, put on your oculus, and start building interesting things on Minecraft or MetaQuest. Once built, either sell or monetize by giving the world an opportunity to experience your creation. Our mission is to boost the blockchain adoption by bringing in applications that can fecilitate day to day crypto token usage and promotion, help humans try to transact crypto and not just use it as a stock but on day to day items. And, while doing so, its not a bad idea to go together to the moon!","links":"https://omniaverse.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/omniaverse/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"0x7e6a1299ae38b796404ee0d771b9ebc5fa535e7d"}}}
