{"name":"IBC Index","id":"ibc-index","symbol":"ibcx","description":"What is the project about? - IBCX is the interchain index token that represents the underlying values in Cosmos. What makes your project unique? - ION DAO, one of the most active DAOs in Cosmos, has been existing since the start of Osmosis which is the biggest DEX in Cosmos. ION is the second token native to Osmosis, and ION stakers have the right to directly participate in the IBCX's operation through the ION DAO governance. That means people who are familiar with the Cosmos ecosystem govern the IBCX. History of your project. - Beginning with the ION 3.0 proposal, there have been many other proposals based on feedback and suggestions from the community, and we have built the product together with ION DAO based on the communications. As a result, we launched IBCX on May 17th on Osmosis. - https://commonwealth.im/ion/discussions - https://ion.wtf/governance/make Whatâ€™s next for your project? - Our next stop is to launch liquid-staked IBCX with Stride in May, the leading liquid-staking provider in Cosmos. Furthermore, we are planning to bring further development that enables users to mint IBCX with ETH on Ethereum. IBCX's ultimate goal is to establish an easier process for newcomers on Cosmos to be onboarded. What can your token be used for? - IBCX doesn't offer use cases besides Mint/Burn at the moment, but after launching the features such as liquid-staked IBCX and cross-chain mint/swap, more use cases will come.","links":"https://index.ion.wtf/mint","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ibc-index/logo.png","detail_platform":{"osmosis":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":"osmo14klwqgkmackvx2tqa0trtg69dmy0nrg4ntq4gjgw2za4734r5seqjqm4gm"}}}
