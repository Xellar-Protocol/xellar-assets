{"name":"Chedda","id":"chedda","symbol":"chedda","description":"Buying CHEDDA is just as easy as ordering the extra cheesy nachos. CHEDDA is an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. It has a 3% tax on every transaction. 1% of that tax is burned forever. The other 2% is for Marketing and Project Development. This makes CHEDDA a deflationary cryptocurrency. 100B CHEDDA tokens have been minted. Half of the supply was burned after, with a total circulating supply of 50B tokens. 10% of the tokens will be released for presale.","links":"https://cheddatoken.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/chedda/logo.png"}
