{"name":"MORK","id":"mork-2","symbol":"mork","description":"Mork is a meme coin powered by a green cartoon dog with questionable intentions and a surprising grasp of blockchain fundamentals. It lives on the Solana network, where transactions are faster, fees are lower, and weirdness is welcomed. The project doesn’t promise utility-laced moon missions—it delivers community-driven chaos, meme culture, and a green dog who probably shouldn’t have this much influence. It’s meme meets machine, and somehow it works.","links":"https://morkcoin.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mork-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"ATo5zfoTpUSa2PqNCn54uGD5UDCBtc5QT2Svqm283XcH","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/ATo5zfoTpUSa2PqNCn54uGD5UDCBtc5QT2Svqm283XcH"}}}
