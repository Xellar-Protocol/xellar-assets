{"name":"Shibaverse SHIVER","id":"shibaverse-token","symbol":"shiver","description":"Shibaverse is the metaverse for Shiba Inus. Players will have their own Shiba Inu avatars, homes, possessions, and life in the Shiba metaverse. Shibaverse will have its beginnings on Shibae Planet, a planet with 1,000,000,000,000,000 square meters of surface area divided into 50% land and 50% water. Even more precisely the first region of the Shibaverse will be Shiba Island, an island with an area of one square kilometer. Shiba Island is at the center of Shiba City, which will be the first ever city with a quasicrystalline structure. The Shibaverse will feature Shibas, property, items, vehicles, weapons, activities, and many more things. Shibaverse will have a vibrant economy with jobs, businesses, products, and services. The Shibaverse economy will be built on the Shibaverse token and the Shibaverse NFT marketplace. The most important piece of the Shibaverse is you. Our community of Shiba lovers, holders, artists, fans, and entrepreneurs will breath life into the virtual realm that is the Shibaverse. We canâ€™t wait to see what the future holds! The Shibaverse token will be the primary currency of Shibaverse. Everything from NFTs and land to apparel and vehicles will be purchasable with Shibaverse tokens. Shibaverse tokens will be randomly dropped in the Shibaverse to reward players for being active in the virtual realm. All economic activity that pertains to trading Shibaverse tokens, such as business and banking, will be recorded on the Shibaverse blockchain, thus providing complete transparency and audit capability to all legal entities in the Shibaverse.","links":"https://www.shibaverse.co/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/shibaverse-token/logo.png"}
