{"name":"Nest Treasury Vault (LP)","id":"nest-treasury-vault-lp","symbol":"intbill","description":"inTBILL is a yield-bearing token that represents ownership in a vault backed by short-term U.S. Treasury bills. It is part of the Nest ecosystem, which offers a suite of tokenized vaults designed to give users transparent, on-chain access to real-world yield. The inTBILL vault uses the BoringVault architecture, a modular system that includes an Accountant contract responsible for setting the token's price per share based on underlying asset valuations. inTBILL integrates with regulated tokenized Treasury providers such as Superstate, M^0, Anemoy, and Mountain Protocol to aggregate and diversify U.S. Treasury bill exposure. The vault is designed to offer stable, dollar-denominated yield suitable for users seeking conservative financial products within a DeFi-native framework. By holding inTBILL, users can earn passive income backed by high-quality government debt while maintaining full on-chain transparency, self-custody, and composability with other protocols.","links":"https://app.nest.credit/nest-treasury-lp-vault","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nest-treasury-vault-lp/logo.png","detail_platform":{"plume-network":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0xdea149f84859d1ec50480c209b71bffa482b0530","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/plume-network/tokens/0xdea149f84859d1ec50480c209b71bffa482b0530"}}}
