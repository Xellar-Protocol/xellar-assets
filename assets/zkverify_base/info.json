{"name":"zkVerify","id":"zkverify_base","symbol":"vfy","description":"Zero-knowledge proofs are crucial for enhancing scalability and privacy by allowing computations to be verified without revealing the underlying data. However, verifying these proofs, especially on chains like Ethereum, is often computationally intensive, slow, and prohibitively expensive. This bottleneck limits the adoption of ZK-powered applications, from privacy-preserving DeFi to scalable rollups and verifiable AI. zkVerify is a high-performance, public, and decentralized Layer 1 blockchain specifically designed for zero-knowledge (ZK) proof verification. It is the universal proof verification layer for real-world, practical applications across the Internet. zkVerify uniquely blends universal compatibility with simplicity and performance, ensuring that as our digital lives grow more complex, keeping them secure becomes easier. It allows other blockchain networks, particularly Layer 2 solutions and dApps utilizing ZK-rollups, to offload the heavy and expensive process of ZK proof verification. This significantly reduces computational burden, lowers transaction costs, and enables faster, more efficient operations across the Web3 ecosystem. Essentially, zkVerify acts as a \"one-stop-shop\" for all ZKP verification needs, simplifying development and unlocking new use cases. Developers can plug into zkVerify to verify a wide range of proof systems without complex custom logic, accelerating innovation and adoption in the ZK ecosystem.","links":"https://zkverify.io/","market_cap":7763855,"market_cap_rank":1748,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/zkverify_base/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa749de6c28262b7ffbc5de27dc845dd7ecd2b358","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0xa749de6c28262b7ffbc5de27dc845dd7ecd2b358"}},"is_native":false}
