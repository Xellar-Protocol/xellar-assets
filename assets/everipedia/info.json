{"name":"IQ","id":"everipedia","symbol":"iq","description":"IQ is building EOAI (Enshrined On-chain AI), a new layer of intelligent agents focused on liquidity, bridging, lending, and launching tokenized agents. As cryptocurrency and DeFi grow increasingly complex, EOAI provides a streamlined, user-friendly interface that simplifies DeFi interactionsâ€”much like ChatGPT transformed information access. Users will be able to talk to the IQ superagent and the EOAI agents will handle tasks like cross-chain transfers and yield optimization in the background. Alongside EOAI, the IQ ecosystem already powers applications like IQ.wiki, the largest blockchain encyclopedia and IQGPT.com, an AI for blockchain knowledge, both applications dedicated to simplifying and expanding access to blockchain technology.","links":"https://iq.wiki/","market_cap":149216922,"market_cap_rank":463,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/everipedia/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x579cea1889991f68acc35ff5c3dd0621ff29b0c9"},"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0e37d70b51ffa2b98b4d34a5712c5291115464e3"},"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb9638272ad6998708de56bbc0a290a1de534a578"}}}
