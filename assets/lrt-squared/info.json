{"name":"LRT Squared","id":"lrt-squared","symbol":"lrt2","description":"LRT² (read as LRT Squared) is a unified restaking rewards protocol as a vault which holds the rewards tokens as underlying assets. Through LRT², LRT projects can pool restaking network protocol rewards into a single vault and issue vault share tokens to their stakers (or distributor contract). This system cuts transaction costs and streamlines the rewards process, great for those with smaller stakes who might find it easier to manage and trade their shares collectively.","links":"https://lrt2.gitbook.io/lrt2","market_cap":9855457,"market_cap_rank":1819,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/lrt-squared/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x8f08b70456eb22f6109f57b8fafe862ed28e6040"}}}
