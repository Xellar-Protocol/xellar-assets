{"name":"蜜蜂狗（Beedog)","id":"beedog_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"蜜蜂狗","description":"BeeDog (蜜蜂狗) comes from a viral Chinese meme — a little dog stung by a bee, with the most adorable and pitiful expression you’ve ever seen. It’s not just a meme — it’s a feeling. BeeDog is about love, joy. And the simple idea: if you like it, just vibe and buy it. What kind of community is BeeDog? BeeDog started its journey on Bonk (SOL) and built a passionate, thriving community for over 3 months. But as we all know — BSC is a better home for Chinese memes. So on October 8th, we officially migrated to BSC. Since the move, BeeDog has broken its previous ATH on SOL and now holds a strong base around $1M market cap. Compared to many new BSC meme projects, BeeDog already has months of solid community building behind it — making it one of the most mature, active, and organic communities on BSC. No bots, no paid shills — just real people, real energy, real vibes.","links":"https://beedog.fun/","market_cap":901368,"market_cap_rank":3874,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/beedog_binance-smart-chain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x2eb08a8fe215f72e01e089c1cd8c4c4937414444","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x2eb08a8fe215f72e01e089c1cd8c4c4937414444"}},"is_native":false}
