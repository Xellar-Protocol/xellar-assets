{"name":"DoubleZero","id":"doublezero","symbol":"2z","description":"DoubleZero is an N1 Network Layer: a foundational, sub-blockchain infrastructure that provides high-performance, low-latency connectivity between nodes, applications, and systems. The protocol enables the contribution of underutilized bandwidth and transaction filtering service, and coordinates their usage via token-based incentive mechanisms. 2Z Tokens are used to access the network’s connectivity service, and, on the other side, reward network contributors and resource providers based on performance and reliability. 2Z Tokens can also be staked to enhance the security of the network.","links":"https://doublezero.xyz/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/doublezero/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"J6pQQ3FAcJQeWPPGppWRb4nM8jU3wLyYbRrLh7feMfvd","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/J6pQQ3FAcJQeWPPGppWRb4nM8jU3wLyYbRrLh7feMfvd"}}}
