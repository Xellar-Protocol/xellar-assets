{"name":"NFT Track Protocol","id":"nft-track-protocol","symbol":"ntp","description":"Users usually store NFTs and tokens in a decentralized wallet. Decentralized wallets are valuable because there is no external intervention, but because individuals manage everything, accidents such as security key leaks occur frequently, and many NFT users are still complaining of loss of valuable assets and damage due to unexpected accidents such as hacking. The NTP project provides high security services for NFT storage and movement through NFT content tracking system, digital content movement path management and execution control system, mutual verification root track system, and NFT contact/data collection system. Users can also enjoy a more secure NFT culture in the NTP marketplace, which is protected by the intense security system provided by the NTP project. It also encourages users to engage in NFT creation activities through compensation for NFT creation activities within the NTP platform. NFTs generated within the NTP platform are subject to a unique protocol, through which the NTP project protects the creatorâ€™s valuable content using the NFT content tracking/protection system.","links":"https://ntp-place.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nft-track-protocol/logo.png"}
