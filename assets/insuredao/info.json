{"name":"InsureDAO","id":"insuredao","symbol":"insure","description":"InsureDAO is a decentralized insurance protocol, allowing anyone to create an insurance pool easily to “Cover every single risk in DeFi space”. InsureDAO provides an insurance builder kit and insurance market. Additionally, we offer the lending function to INSURE token lockers. Users can exchange the smart contract hacking risks in the DeFi space in the insurance market. Users can be either purchasers or underwriters, or both in the insurance market. As for insurance payment decisions, we delegate it to third-party DAO named ReportingDAO consisting of code audit companies such as QuantStamp, Sentnl, WatchPug, Pessimistic. And we’ve already partnered with some major protocols like Tokemak, Redacted, NewOrder, Idle Finance, DFX, Lixir finance, BoringDAO, and Divergence and provide insurances for these protocols. InsureDAO adopts the veToken model for governance. By locking INSURE token, users can boost farming rewards and voting power of InsureDAO. We’ve launched InsureDAO on Mainnet on the 22nd of February and will launch it on Arbitrum later. And we have a plan to provide API for integration with other protocols and adopt multicurrency to expand our community in 2022.","links":"https://www.insuredao.fi/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/insuredao/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd83ae04c9ed29d6d3e6bf720c71bc7beb424393e"}}}
