{"name":"BNB Superheroes","id":"bnb-superheroes","symbol":"bsh","description":"\"The BNB Superheroes experience will kick out with a 2D endless runner game that offers a basic yet addictive in-game experience that pushes players to beat the scoreboard. The better your score, the more likely you are to get BSH platform tokens through pre-scheduled periodic airdrops. While conquering randomly generated obstacles and eliminating adversaries without running out of life or being left behind, players may gather as many in-game virtual cash, now referred to as Gems. Along the journey, Power-ups may be obtained to help you blow the opponent away and increase your high score. But watch out! Don't get too comfy with the Power-up's luxury; it'll only be available for a limited time, so make the most of it. As the player advances through a variety of environments, the game's speed will steadily rise. Each area presents players with a higher level of difficulty. Only If They Have What It Takes! The harder the difficulty, the larger the prize for gamers.\"","links":"https://bnbsuperheroes.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bnb-superheroes/logo.png"}
