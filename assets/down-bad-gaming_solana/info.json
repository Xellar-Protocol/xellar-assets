{"name":"Down Bad Gaming","id":"down-bad-gaming_solana","symbol":"downbad","description":"Down Bad Gaming is powered by the UP GOOD Protocol, a system engineered to burn the supply of $DOWNBAD toward zero and make holders up good. Every transaction incurs a 2.5% fee that is permanently burned, creating continuous deflation and sustainable upward pressure over time. The protocol was built to usher in a new era of community coins on Solana, driven not by promises or hype, but by code, belief, and unstoppable mechanics.","links":"https://downbad.xyz","market_cap":218058,"market_cap_rank":5789,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/down-bad-gaming/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"6UzcYYWb2myAvN86uQ9XAKtm7yQkddacGxktT5RkGood","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/6UzcYYWb2myAvN86uQ9XAKtm7yQkddacGxktT5RkGood"}},"is_native":false}
