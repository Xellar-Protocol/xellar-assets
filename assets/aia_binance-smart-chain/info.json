{"name":"DeAgentAI","id":"aia_binance-smart-chain","symbol":"aia","description":"DeAgentAI is an AI agent infrastructure project designed to enable the creation, deployment, and coordination of autonomous agents in Web3. Its framework addresses three fundamental challenges for agents—Identity, Continuity, and Consensus—through modular components such as agent identity, memory, lifecycle management, consensus mechanisms, and tool integration. The ecosystem includes both B2C and B2B products. AlphaX, the first live product, is an AI-driven crypto prediction engine that provides BTC/ETH short-term price trend signals with over 70% accuracy. It has achieved more than 401K daily active users, 17M+ total users, and 192M+ on-chain transactions across Sui, BNB Chain, and opBNB. Upcoming products include CorrAI, a no-code quantitative strategy builder, and Truesights, an InfoFi platform that rewards accurate market insights and governance forecasting. The native token AIA functions as the backbone of the ecosystem. It is used to access services, stake for rewards, participate in governance, and receive ecosystem incentives. A portion of project revenue is also allocated for token buyback and burn, supporting long-term value. Backed by leading investors such as Web3.com Ventures, SNZ Capital, KuCoin Ventures, Vertex Capital, Valkyrie Fund and Momentum, and integrated with partners including Binance Wallet, OKX Wallet, and Sui Network, DeAgentAI delivers a scalable, multi-chain AI agent framework with proven adoption.","links":"https://deagent.ai/","market_cap":10433765,"market_cap_rank":1533,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/aia/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x53EC33Cd4fA46b9ecED9cA3f6dB626C5FfCd55cC","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/bsc/tokens/0x53EC33Cd4fA46b9ecED9cA3f6dB626C5FfCd55cC"}},"is_native":false}
