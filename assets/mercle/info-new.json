{"name":"MERCLE","id":"mercle","symbol":"$mercle","description":"Mercle envisions to create a decentralized web3 identity/reputation data layer for web3 dapps. It allows dapps to issue attestations for both on-chain and off-chain user activities. The architectural core of Mercle provides a foundation for decentralized identities, which can be used for better governance, efficient coordination, smart token rewards distribution, and even as a reputation tool, where any dapp can tap into Mercle to determine a web3 user's reputation, globally as well as in a certain community.","links":"https://mercle.xyz","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mercle/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
