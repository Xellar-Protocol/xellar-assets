{"name":"Solana VM","id":"solana-vm_solana","symbol":"svm","description":"Solana VM — The First EVM compatible L2 for Solana What is Solana VM? Solana VM is a fully compatible Ethereum environment built on the Solana blockchain. This platform empowers developers to deploy Ethereum dApps seamlessly without the need for significant reconfiguration. SolanaVM enables dApps built with Solidity and Vyper to leverage Solana’s network advantages: low fees, high transaction speeds, and the capability for parallel transaction execution. For developers, this translates to the ability to create Solana-compatible contracts using familiar tools from the Ethereum ecosystem. Developers using Solana VM maintain access to: * Familiar programming languages such as Solidity and Vyper. * Well-known Ethereum development tools. * Compatibility with the Ethereum RPC API. Ethereum account and signature systems, and token standards like ERC-20 and ERC-721. * Extremely low gas fees - approximately $0.01 per transaction. * High transaction speed, up to 5,000 transactions per second. * Integration into the rapidly expanding Solana ecosystem without the need for additional validators.","links":"https://solanavm.xyz/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/solana-vm_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"GNo91D4oKksLiq7TTd2gygCWqAbtU47rSGG1fAo5eA7h","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/GNo91D4oKksLiq7TTd2gygCWqAbtU47rSGG1fAo5eA7h"}},"is_native":false}
