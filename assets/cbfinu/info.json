We place free bets on all the matches of the Brazilian team, we burn tokens for each goal and each match, and we carry out purchasing competitions among all members of the community, where each investor can earn money by holding and participating. CBF Inu is a smart contract that distributes USDT among all holders, since 5% of each purchase and sale transaction is used to buy USDT and distribute it among all holders. We have an NFT collection of the Brazilian team and we are also developing a collection called \"CBF Inu Legends\" that will give its name to the game we are developing.","links":"https://cbfinu.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/cbfinu/logo.png","detail_platform":{"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa0e1399de9edf5a85a06a5ce34f8810eb62ef40e"}}}
