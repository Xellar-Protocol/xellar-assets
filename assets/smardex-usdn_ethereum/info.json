{"name":"SMARDEX USDN","id":"smardex-usdn_ethereum","symbol":"usdn","description":"USDN is a pioneering synthetic U.S. dollar token developed within the SmarDex ecosystem. Unlike traditional stablecoins that often depend on centralized reserves or collateral to maintain their value, USDN employs a fully decentralized approach. Its value stability is achieved through a mathematical financial process known as a Delta-Neutral strategy. This strategy involves balancing two distinct groups of participants: - Vault Participants: These users deposit assets into the protocol’s vault to mint USDN tokens. - Long Position Traders: These traders open leveraged long positions on the underlying asset, seeking amplified exposure. The interplay between these groups ensures that USDN maintains a value close to that of the U.S. dollar while simultaneously generating yields for its holders. This design offers a decentralized alternative to traditional stablecoins, providing both stability and profitability within the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. ￼","links":"https://smardex.io/usdn","market_cap":1846049,"market_cap_rank":3056,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/smardex-usdn/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xde17a000ba631c5d7c2bd9fb692efea52d90dee2","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xde17a000ba631c5d7c2bd9fb692efea52d90dee2"}},"is_native":false}
