{"name":"Wrapped Legia Warsaw (Kayen)","id":"wrapped-legia-warsaw-kayen","symbol":"wleg","description":"Fan Tokens are official digital assets minted on Chiliz Chain representing ownership in sports teams or entertainment entities. They offer benefits like voting rights and exclusive content to increase fan engagement. Wrapped Fan Tokens on KAYEN solve the problem of fan tokens being non-divisible. Fan Tokens can be traded in fractional amounts (e.g. 8.88 PSG tokens instead of just 8 or 9), improving liquidity and flexibility.","links":"https://app.kayen.org/trade/chz-wLEG","market_cap":34299,"market_cap_rank":8045,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wrapped-legia-warsaw-kayen/logo.png","detail_platform":{"chiliz":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x58386a2d1c45d4c5349468892f5f73ca3e53ea22","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/chiliz-chain/tokens/0x58386a2d1c45d4c5349468892f5f73ca3e53ea22"}}}
