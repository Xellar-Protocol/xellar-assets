Eterna combines Order Book trading with Binance Cloud-enabled liquidity. In Version 2, we will deploy our proprietary AMM-aggregator, that allows investors to execute their trades on PCS and Uniswap, as well as AVAX, MATIC, and ADA. Eterna is the first exchange to share 50% of its net income with EHX token stakers, creating an underlying value proposition that is unmatched in the crypto space.","links":"https://eterna.exchange/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/eterna-hybrid-exchange/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe1747a23c44f445062078e3c528c9f4c28c50a51"},"binance-smart-chain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe1747a23c44f445062078e3c528c9f4c28c50a51"}}}
