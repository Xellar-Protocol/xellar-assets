{"name":"Liquis","id":"liquis","symbol":"liq","description":"Liquis sits on top of Bunni and Uniswap V3 to complete a full-stack liquidity solution for DeFi. Liquis is a liquid wrapper solution for veLIT, the voting-escrow governance token of Bunni. Users can lock veLIT with Liquis permanently in exchange for liqLIT, a freely transferrable ERC-20. This allows Liquis to then offer liquidity providers who stake their Bunni range tokens with Liquis boosted emissions. Altogether, Liquis offers greater capital efficiency to various Bunni stakeholders. LIQ earns platform fees and is used to vote on Bunni governance to earn additional rewards. This model has been implemented for Curve and Balancer by Convex and Aura, respectively.","links":"https://www.liquis.app/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/liquis/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xd82fd4d6d62f89a1e50b1db69ad19932314aa408"}}}
