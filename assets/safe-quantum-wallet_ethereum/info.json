{"name":"Safe Quantum Wallet","id":"safe-quantum-wallet_ethereum","symbol":"sqw","description":"The Safe Quantum Wallet implements ML-KEM alongside traditional cryptography to create a hybrid system that maintains compatibility with current blockchain networks while protecting against future quantum threats. This approach provides a practical transition path to post-quantum security without requiring immediate changes to blockchain protocols. Quantum computers leverage quantum mechanical phenomena to perform computations that are intractable for classical computers. While general-purpose quantum computers are still in early development stages, specialized algorithms have been developed that could break widely used cryptographic systems once sufficiently powerful quantum hardware is available. ML-KEM (Module-Lattice Key Encapsulation Mechanism), formerly known as CRYSTALS-Kyber, is a lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism that was selected by NIST in July 2022 as the primary algorithm for post-quantum key establishment [2]. The Safe Quantum Wallet implements ML-KEM to protect private keys and transaction data from quantum attacks.","links":"https://safequantumwallet.com","market_cap":5146.52,"market_cap_rank":12323,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/safe-quantum-wallet_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xd30e5c58c01cc0ec828051664e45f51f38c27b11","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xd30e5c58c01cc0ec828051664e45f51f38c27b11"}},"is_native":false}
