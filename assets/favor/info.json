{"name":"Favor","id":"favor","symbol":"favor","description":"Favor was first issued on Apr 26, 2022 and is an NFT alliance token designed to cycle and connect the on-offline ecosystem of NFT projects. We continue to expand the use of FAVOR by forming an alliance with conventional offline companies that want to participate in the metaverse ecosystem, and form FAVOR Alliance with other NFT projects that have clear offline and online tokens to grow and contribute to develop within the same tokenomics system. FAVOR is a key currency for multiple NFT projects that connect on-off industries, creating an ecosystem that crosses the real industry and the metaverse, discovering various business models. It is designed to be converted into 'NFT Brand Points', which are offline points that can be exchanged for 1:1 value, in order to accelerate the entry of offline companies, considering and devoting their vision to a natural connection between the existing economic system and the metaverse economic system.","links":"https://favoralliance.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/favor/logo.png","detail_platform":{"klay-token":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe79efff8a61567d932be2a8c33057f7b2a8bc43b"}}}
