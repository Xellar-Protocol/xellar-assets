Effective accelerationism, often abbreviated as \"e/acc\", is a 21st-century philosophical movement that advocates for an explicitly pro-technology stance. Its proponents believe that unrestricted technological progress (especially driven by artificial intelligence) is a solution to universal human problems like poverty, war and climate change. We believe in promoting and supporting this movement by expressing it as a cultural artifact on the blockchain.","links":"https://eacconsol.com","market_cap":156695,"market_cap_rank":6273,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/effective-accelerationism_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"GqmEdRD3zGUZdYPeuDeXxCc8Cj1DBmGSYK97TCwSpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/GqmEdRD3zGUZdYPeuDeXxCc8Cj1DBmGSYK97TCwSpump"}},"is_native":false}
