{"name":"AlfProtocol","id":"alfprotocol","symbol":"alf","description":"At the core lies the protocol for leveraged liquidity provision into AMMs and yield farming. Complementary to that, Alfprotocol offers two protocols for unleveraged liquidity management: AlfMM (a decentralized exchange service) and Alf (an overcollateralized borrowing service). The core purpose of both protocols is to provide entry points for traders and risk-averse investors, offering them a platform to trade and provide liquidity, all the while reining in additional revenue from indirectly providing liquidity. The protocol will be an interesting tool for risk-averse investors to use their capital to follow a target of principal-protected yield (can be low) by providing capital into the AMM pools. Whereas risk-seeking investors will be able to use their capital to gain maximal yield (by taking risks) by providing liquidity into (external) AMMs with leverage borrowed. For borrowers who will be able to use collateral thanks to the access to liquidity, there will be an opportunity to borrow from the lending pools. Additionally, arbitrageurs will also use their automation skills, short-term capital access to perform liquidations in order to earn assets by facilitating market efficiency.","links":"https://alfprotocol.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/alfprotocol/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"36s9cAKFqea4gGFwAjG92Aoo3Zx5L3AbqBB519QeKsZU"}}}
