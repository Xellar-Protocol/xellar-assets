{"name":"MetaMUI","id":"metamui_avalanche","symbol":"mmui","description":"MetaMUI is building the world's first identity-native blockchain that fundamentally changes how digital assets, payments, and AI commerce work. Instead of using cryptographic addresses, everything operates through Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) - permanent digital identities for humans, organizations, and AI agents. This architecture solves critical problems: users can't lose funds from lost keys, the system can upgrade to quantum-resistant encryption without disrupting operations, and AI agents can participate in regulated commerce with verified identities. The platform already powers sovereign digital currencies for Indigenous nations and was selected by the Bank for International Settlements to develop next-generation payment technology. It's essentially creating the trust infrastructure for an economy where autonomous AI systems conduct business alongside humans with cryptographic certainty.","links":"https://www.swnglobal.com/","market_cap":19157043,"market_cap_rank":1141,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/metamui_avalanche/logo.png","detail_platform":{"avalanche":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"0xfc8a21dbcab432fb5e469d80f976e022c2f56ea0","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/avax/tokens/0xfc8a21dbcab432fb5e469d80f976e022c2f56ea0"}},"is_native":false}
