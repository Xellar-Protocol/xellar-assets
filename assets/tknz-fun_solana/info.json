{"name":"TKNZ.FUN","id":"tknz-fun_solana","symbol":"tknz","description":"TKNZ is a browser extension that allows users to tokenize the internet through Pump.fun directly from any news article, social post, or web page. Designed for speed and simplicity, TKNZ detects content from the active browser tab and uses AI to prefill relevant token metadata — including name, symbol, and image — based on the page’s content. The tool also includes a built-in, non-custodial Solana wallet to streamline the creation process. Once the wallet is funded, users can launch a token in just one click. TKNZ lowers the barrier to token creation, enabling anyone to instantly tokenize internet culture, trends, or news events in one click.","links":"https://tknz.fun","market_cap":9527.47,"market_cap_rank":11281,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/tknz-fun_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"AfyDiEptGHEDgD69y56XjNSbTs23LaF1YHANVKnWpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/AfyDiEptGHEDgD69y56XjNSbTs23LaF1YHANVKnWpump"}},"is_native":false}
