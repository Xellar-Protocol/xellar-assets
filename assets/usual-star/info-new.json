{"name":"USUAL Star","id":"usual-star","symbol":"usual*","description":"Usual protocol is a decentralized banking framework centered around USD0, a stablecoin designed as a liquid deposit token. It embodies the principle of redistributing value generated by users through a revenue-based token, USUAL. This approach enables users to access yields while simultaneously gaining exposure to the protocol’s growth and long-term success. USUAL* is Usual Protocol’s native token, reserved for early contributors and designed to protect $USUAL holders from dilution caused by insiders. It’s a unique incentive for initial supporters, allowing them to stake USUAL* for exclusive rights and benefits, while keeping the value of $USUAL in the hands of the community.","links":"https://usual.money/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/usual-star/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x094b360ae512a65584d4f5be33d68b2e08677b89"}}}
