{"name":"f(x) Protocol Leveraged ETH","id":"f-x-protocol-leveraged-eth","symbol":"xeth","description":"What is the project about? f(x) splits ETH into a mix of low-volatility “floating stablecoins” called fETH and high-volatility “leveraged ETH” tokens called xETH. Users can supply ETH or stETH to mint either one (pure ETH is zapped into stETH before deposit) What makes your project unique? f(x) was created to avoid centralized risks from real-world assets. Apart from smart contract and oracle risk, which are common to nearly all DeFi protocols, the main risk for f(x) is of an extreme outlier rapid ETH price drop which is larger than the ability of the currently minted xETH to absorb. In that case, xETH price would go to zero (sort of like a liquidation) and fETH would lose its low volatility nature, reverting to 1:1 ETH price movements. What can your token be used for? xETH provides powerful, free leverage on ETH. No funding rate, a very low risk of liquidation. It’s a great token to amplify your gains on a long-term bet on ETH price growth.","links":"https://fx.aladdin.club/home/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/f-x-protocol-leveraged-eth/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe063f04f280c60aeca68b38341c2eecbec703ae2"}}}
