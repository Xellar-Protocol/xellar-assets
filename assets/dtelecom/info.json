{"name":"dTelecom","id":"dtelecom","symbol":"dtel","description":"dTelecom is building a decentralized real-time communication (dRTC) network on Solana, enabling developers to integrate secure, scalable voice, video, and chat functionalities directly into their applications while bridging human users and AI agents like LLMs. Unlike traditional platforms, dTelecom’s open-source infrastructure allows users to own their resources-such as bandwidth and data-and earn rewards by contributing to the network’s decentralized nodes. Leveraging Solana’s high-speed blockchain the platform ensures low-latency interactions, elastic scalability, and robust security, making it ideal for AI-enhanced use cases like telemedicine, DeFi, or live streaming. By combining peer-to-peer communication with blockchain transparency, dTelecom offers a censorship-resistant alternative to centralized services, prioritizing data sovereignty and customizable AI integrations (e.g., real-time translation, automated moderation) without vendor lock-in.","links":"https://dtelecom.org/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dtelecom/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
