{"name":"Lily's Coin","id":"lily-s-coin_solana","symbol":"lily","description":"Lily's Coin ($LILY) is a playful memecoin inspired by my dog, Lily, who shares a special bond with the world of crypto—she was born on January 3, 2009, the same day Bitcoin’s blockchain began! Just like Bitcoin, $LILY has a fixed supply of 21 million tokens, but it's all about bringing a fun, community-driven twist to the space. We aim to grow by spreading Lily's story, building a strong community, and securing exchange listings that make $LILY easy for everyone to trade and enjoy.","links":"https://www.lilyscoin.com/","market_cap":15280.45,"market_cap_rank":10365,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/lily-s-coin_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"Co5WwGeZfpfqGE1tUyAp1SBjcmumoY9sNN99MXRbX98K","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/Co5WwGeZfpfqGE1tUyAp1SBjcmumoY9sNN99MXRbX98K"}},"is_native":false}
