{"name":"Agent XYZ","id":"trader-2","symbol":"trader","description":"AgentXYZ is an AI-powered crypto trading terminal that solves the critical problem facing modern traders: information overload without actionable intelligence. While traders have access to massive amounts of data across fragmented platforms like TradingView, social media, and on-chain analytics, they struggle to synthesize these signals fast enough to capture profitable opportunities. This cognitive overload causes traders to miss 70% of profitable setups—not due to lack of skill, but inability to process information quickly enough in 24/7 markets. AgentXYZ transforms this process by deploying 28 specialized AI agents that work together to synthesize market intelligence in real-time. Instead of manually aggregating scattered information, traders receive coordinated analysis that simultaneously processes technical patterns, on-chain whale flows, social sentiment shifts, and institutional movements. The system operates like a professional trading floor where each AI specialist focuses on their domain—technical analysis, social monitoring, on-chain research, and quantitative strategy—but all communicate findings instantly to create confluence confirmation across multiple data streams.","links":"https://www.agentxyz.io/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/trader-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""},"avalanche":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xf8b22737cbfea137f9b2737d1dab2a8a21608cee","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/avax/tokens/0xf8b22737cbfea137f9b2737d1dab2a8a21608cee"}}}
