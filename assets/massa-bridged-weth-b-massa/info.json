{"name":"Massa Bridged WETH.b (Massa)","id":"massa-bridged-weth-b-massa","symbol":"weth.b","description":"The Weth.b token is a bridged version of the Wrapped Ether (Weth) token from the Binance Smart Chain (BNB Chain), now seamlessly integrated into the Massa blockchain ecosystem. This token is what users will receive when they bridge their Weth from the BNB Chain to the Massa blockchain, ensuring smooth cross-chain asset transfers. Weth.b is an essential component of the Dusa protocol, specifically featured in one of its key liquidity pools: Weth.b <-> Weth.e. This integration allows users to participate in liquidity provision, yield farming, and various DeFi activities on Massa while retaining the value and functionality of their Weth assets. By bridging Weth to Massa, users can enjoy enhanced interoperability, increased liquidity options, and access to diverse decentralized finance opportunities across multiple blockchains. The Weth.b token not only maintains the core properties of the original Weth but also extends its utility by enabling interactions within the Massa DeFi landscape, thereby fostering a more connected and versatile blockchain ecosystem.","links":"https://app.dusa.io/pools","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/massa-bridged-weth-b-massa/logo.png","detail_platform":{"massa":{"decimal_place":256,"contract_address":"AS125oPLYRTtfVjpWisPZVTLjBhCFfQ1jDsi75XNtRm1NZux54eCj"}}}
