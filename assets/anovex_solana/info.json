{"name":"ANOVEX","id":"anovex_solana","symbol":"anv","description":"Anovex is a privacy-focused decentralized trading layer built on Solana. It enables users to execute swaps anonymously using encrypted routing, a dual-wallet architecture, and deposit relays that break the on-chain transaction graph. Unlike typical DEX activity, trades performed through Anovex cannot be linked to a user’s public wallet. The protocol integrates with major Solana liquidity sources while maintaining complete unlinkability, allowing users to trade any SPL token through private settlement. Anovex also provides a public explorer that verifies transaction outcomes without exposing user identity or trading patterns.","links":"https://anovex.io/","market_cap":2828.64,"market_cap_rank":12943,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/anovex/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"94WxCtGPFYdyWQ29VmqYbX6y7xbpUteHtX3Mak6Jpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/94WxCtGPFYdyWQ29VmqYbX6y7xbpUteHtX3Mak6Jpump"}},"is_native":false}
