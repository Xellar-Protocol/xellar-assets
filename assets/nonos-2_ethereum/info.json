The project is designed as a foundation for next-generation digital infrastructure where privacy, autonomy, and censorship-resistance are guaranteed at the protocol level.","links":"https://nonos.systems/","market_cap":2672165,"market_cap_rank":2666,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/nonos-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x0a26c80be4e060e688d7c23addb92cbb5d2c9eca","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x0a26c80be4e060e688d7c23addb92cbb5d2c9eca"}},"is_native":false}
