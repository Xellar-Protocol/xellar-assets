{"name":"Opanarchy","id":"opanarchy-2_solana","symbol":"opan","description":"we’re building humanoid prototypes that demonstrate this principle in real time. these robots are designed with modular hardware, open firmware and onchain integration, meaning they can directly interact with blockchain logic, perform verifiable tasks and even earn or transact digitally. every part of the system from mechanical control to AI logic is built to be opensource, upgradable and forkable by the community. at the heart of our ecosystem is $OPAN, our governance and coordination token. it enables decentralized decision making, rewards contributors and powers the upcoming Opanarchy Marketplace: a platform for trading robotics datasets, modular codes, hardware blueprints and extensions. this marketplace connects developers, hardware builders and AI researchers, creating a self sustaining cycle of innovation.","links":"https://opanarchyfoundation.com/","market_cap":245451,"market_cap_rank":5609,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/opanarchy-2_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"3Ydb2n8vAFdBJYpdiZEoDxRXLmiGDY1fuizVmMPMpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/3Ydb2n8vAFdBJYpdiZEoDxRXLmiGDY1fuizVmMPMpump"}},"is_native":false}
