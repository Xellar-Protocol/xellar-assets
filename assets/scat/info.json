{"name":"Scat","id":"scat","symbol":"cat","description":"Meet the world’s first coin created by a cat! Dogs are scared of me. $CAT is here to stop the global dominance of dog coins in crypto. (I’m also the most memeable cat in existence) Our mission is to get rid of all the garbage in crypto by converting everything into $CAT. I love to meow. Bitcoin was a currency created out of thin air... with no value. Value was given by people putting money into it, actual circulating money, used to buy Bitcoin, which drove the price up. $CAT is the same.","links":"https://mynameisscat.com/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/scat/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x02d7a93829b365b7ad4c582dace1493aac50a290"}}}
