{"name":"JOMON","id":"jomon_ethereum","symbol":"jomon","description":"The Jomon Shiba is neither wolf nor wolf-mix, though its appearance evokes the preserved Japanese Wolf—taller, leaner, and marked by a shallow stop. This “breed” was intentionally crafted to resemble the native dogs of Japan from over 1,000 years ago, embodying a primal elegance lost to time. Unlike the modern Shiba Inu, the Jomon Shiba rarely carries the suffix “Inu” or “Ken,” a subtle linguistic choice that deepens its mystique and sets it apart as something older, wilder, and more elemental. It’s not just a dog—it’s a living echo of Japan’s ancestral canine lineage, a symbol of untamed heritage and mythic continuity.","links":"https://jomonoeth.com/","market_cap":2668.01,"market_cap_rank":12969,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/jomon/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x7addde640b2a003e30250e3829f82c9479f6ed5d","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x7addde640b2a003e30250e3829f82c9479f6ed5d"}},"is_native":false}
