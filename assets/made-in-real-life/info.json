We aim to provide NFT owners with the opportunity to showcase their art both digitally and physically. The MIRL Project also aims to support, empower, and curate aspiring new designers in the metaverse. The MIRL ecosystem consists of not just the NFTs, but a DAO and Incubation program for new designers.
