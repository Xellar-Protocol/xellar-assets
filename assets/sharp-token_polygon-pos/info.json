{"name":"Sharp Token","id":"sharp-token_polygon-pos","symbol":"sharp","description":"Sharp Economy solves the biggest challenge of Web3—onboarding users from Web2 into decentralized ecosystems. Instead of requiring startups or communities to build complex blockchain infrastructure, Sharp Economy provides plug-and-play tools to tokenize user engagement, learning, and growth. Its focus areas include education, nonprofits, youth and college athletes, healthcare, creators, and builders, with partners already in the pipeline. The ecosystem is powered by four key components: - Sharp Platform – a no-code Web3 platform for tokenization and rewards. - Sharp Token ($SHARP) – the fuel of the ecosystem, enabling rewards, growth, and governance. - Sharp Protocol – decentralized infrastructure for tokenomics and distribution. - Sharp Rewards App – a SocialFi super app that gamifies activities and rewards users daily. Key features include Learn2Earn, Contribute2Earn, and Spend2Grow, which allow users to earn tokens for learning or contributing and spend them on personal growth. Unlike most tokens, Sharp Economy is community-first, bridging millions of Web2 users into Web3 with real-world utility and sustainable growth.","links":"https://sharpeconomy.org/","market_cap":17953564,"market_cap_rank":1183,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/sharp-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xb36b62929762acf8a9cc27ecebf6d353ebb48244","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/polygon_pos/tokens/0xb36b62929762acf8a9cc27ecebf6d353ebb48244"}},"is_native":false}
