Mozaic plans to release a many different ecosystem and chain driven vault strategies. The protocol is also set to continue the optimization of its AI/ML to continue to expand the offering of yield to its users. Additionally, the MozaicDAO will also be established to move towards the decentralization of the protocol. What can your token be used for? The MOZ token will be used for governing all decisions of the protocol and to direct the DAO treasury throughout the protocol and crypto ecosystem to create a sustainable protocol in the long-term.","links":"https://www.mozaic.finance/","market_cap":2330535,"market_cap_rank":2250,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mozaic/logo.png","detail_platform":{"arbitrum-one":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x20547341e58fb558637fa15379c92e11f7b7f710"}}}
