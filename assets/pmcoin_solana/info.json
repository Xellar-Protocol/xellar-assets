{"name":"PMCoin","id":"pmcoin_solana","symbol":"$pm","description":"PMCoin ($PM) is a blockchain-powered reward and payment ecosystem built on the Solana network, designed specifically for nightlife, entertainment, and hospitality industries. It transforms real-world venue interactions, such as attending events, booking VIP tables, or participating in contests into on-chain, verifiable experiences where users earn and spend PM tokens across partnered venues globally. The project’s goal is to unify nightlife engagement, digital rewards, and transparent blockchain transactions into a single ecosystem where both users and venues benefit. Nightlife patrons can earn PMCoin through verified event participation, contests, and social engagement, while partner venues use PM to reduce fees, increase loyalty, and promote brand awareness. PMCoin integrates DeFi, GameFi, and Reality TV alignment to expand visibility and adoption, offering staking, NFT memberships, and cross-platform promotions. Led by entertainment figure Peter Madrigal, PMCoin leverages his network to merge hospitality and popular culture exposure. Its utility extends beyond crypto transactions, serving as a lifestyle currency that bridges real-world nightlife experiences with the transparency, efficiency, and scalability of Solana’s blockchain infrastructure.","links":"https://www.pmcoin.xyz","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pmcoin_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"pc3gLpoZCe79SZAbABtes2fiWAaiTJuTk9NsNxR2ZSj","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/pc3gLpoZCe79SZAbABtes2fiWAaiTJuTk9NsNxR2ZSj"}},"is_native":false}
