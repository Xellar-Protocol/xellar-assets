{"name":"Asteroid Shiba","id":"asteroid-shiba_ethereum","symbol":"asteroid","description":"Asteroid Shiba is inspired by a real-life event where a Shiba Inu plush toy named \"Asteroid\" served as a zero-gravity indicator during the Polaris Dawn mission. This connection to space travel gives it a narrative that's both whimsical and grounded in a tangible event, differentiating it from other meme coins which might rely solely on internet culture or celebrity endorsements. The coin's mascot, the zero-gravity Shiba Inu, was designed by a young cancer survivor, Liv Perrotto, adding a layer of emotional connection and human interest story that's rare in the crypto space. This backstory not only provides a unique selling point but also a community rallying point.","links":"https://asteroidshiba-erc.com/","market_cap":28002,"market_cap_rank":9150,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/asteroid-shiba/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0xf280b16ef293d8e534e370794ef26bf312694126","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xf280b16ef293d8e534e370794ef26bf312694126"}},"is_native":false}
