{"name":"WaykiChain","id":"waykichain","symbol":"wicc","description":"WaykiChain is a blockchain-based gambling platform that supports Turing devices. Other highlights include the fact that it makes use of a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Delegated+Proof-of-Stake&view=market\">DPoS (Delegated Proof-of-Stake)</a> consensus mechanism, that it generates a new block every ten seconds, and that it uses eleven voting nodes. According to the team behind the Hong Kong-based project, the network is also capable of handling 1000+ transactions per second. The platform’s main goal is to offer users a stable and secure gambling environment. WaykiChain uses a DPoS consensus mechanism with eleven accounting nodes. The annual rate of return is 5% for the first year, with a 1% increase with every year that goes by. Each time a block is created, an accounting node is randomly associated. The accounting node gains all of the transaction fees in its accounting block. Users can earn interest by locking WaykiChain coins. The interest is automatically determined each time the votes for the corresponding user account change. The terms of betting are triggered by the initiator through smart contract transactions. Users can initiate various betting contract transactions, all of which can be searched and identified in the block browsers. Even though it’s not a very popular project in the crypto space at the current moment, WaykiChain has the potential to expand its reach and spark the interest of people due to its decentralized gambling platform. The timing is also a very fortunate one, as the team seems to have everything in place before the start of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The project has a powerful dApp associated with its name. The WaykiChain Betting provides its users with real-time betting possibilities, in a transparent and open way. All the betting data is public, searchable, well organized, and cannot be changed or affected by any third-party interests. Any potential illegal actions can be, therefore, easily discovered.","links":"https://www.waykichain.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/waykichain/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
