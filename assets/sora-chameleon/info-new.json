{"name":"SORA Chameleon","id":"sora-chameleon","symbol":"karma","description":"The KARMA token provides farming rewards to liquidity providers in the XOR-ETH pool on Polkaswap. By participating in liquidity provision for this pool, users are rewarded with KARMA, encouraging more liquidity in the Chameleon pools. KARMA also has a deflationary mechanism. During the initial mint, which ended on June 6th, 1 KARMA token was minted for every 10 million XOR burned. After this initial minting, the KARMA token becomes deflationary, with 1% of minted KXOR used to buy back and burn KARMA tokens.","links":"https://sora.org/","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/sora-chameleon/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
