{"name":"Paradigm Zero","id":"paradigm-zero","symbol":"pz","description":"Paradigm Zero is a tax-less ERC20 contract paradigm that allows for fund raising with zero tax and no pre-loaded wallets. It at once introduces a market-making layer to AMMs and allows for crypto projects to introduce a new revenue generating vector into the mix: by weaponizing available liquidity. In a way that we believe will become a DeFi smart contract standard (we will be applying for an EIP), Paradigm Zero generates project revenue by leveraging the project’s DEX liquidity in a way that is at once tax-free for the investor, has unnoticeable price impact, and helps projects improve their liquidity in more effective ways. Paradigm Zero’s vision is straightforward: to build a unique and sustainable ecosystem of projects and tooling centered around its groundbreaking contract.","links":"https://paradigmzero.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/paradigm-zero/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x578dc16c47327429ff1594fa3eb77a96f38438e0"}}}
