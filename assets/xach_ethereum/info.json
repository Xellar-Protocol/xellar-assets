To hide the origin of a newly created transaction, it gets relayed among a subset of peers before it is widely broadcasted. Xach supports the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which allows developers to easily port existing Ethereum smart contracts to the Xach network and build new DApps leveraging Xach's privacy features and the stability of USDX.
