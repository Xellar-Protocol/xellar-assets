{"name":"imnotwrongimearly","id":"imnotwrongimearly","symbol":"early","description":"Being early in crypto investing can be transformative, offering unique advantages as new technologies and networks emerge. Early adopters in the crypto sphere—those who recognize and invest in promising projects before they gain mainstream traction—often become part of foundational communities. These early communities shape the project’s direction, culture, and utility, providing critical feedback and building trust. Getting in early means higher risk but also the potential for high rewards as the ecosystem matures and gains value. As crypto evolves, being early remains a defining factor in gaining influence and leveraging opportunities.","links":"https://justearly.com","market_cap":218868,"market_cap_rank":5393,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/imnotwrongimearly/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"5a5iV4jTaxyPP4mMeeRfZStz6tYQ65p2CKTNygdRpump"}}}
