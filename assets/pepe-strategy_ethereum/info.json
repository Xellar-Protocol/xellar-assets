{"name":"Pepe Strategy","id":"pepe-strategy_ethereum","symbol":"pepestr","description":"Pepe Strategy (PEPESTR) is an ERC-20 token on Ethereum designed around a treasury-based trading system connected to the PEPE token. The project applies a 10% tax on both buys and sells, accumulating funds within the contract. Once the treasury reaches a defined threshold, the contract automatically purchases PEPE tokens. These tokens are later sold only when a 20% profit condition is achieved, ensuring trades are profitable. The proceeds are then used to buy back PEPESTR tokens, which are permanently burned, creating a deflationary supply model.","links":"https://pepestrategy.io/","market_cap":7220.33,"market_cap_rank":11790,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/pepe-strategy/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa89f4ca08f729364f0e1ce657c4b6d5ea60e1f91","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xa89f4ca08f729364f0e1ce657c4b6d5ea60e1f91"}},"is_native":false}
