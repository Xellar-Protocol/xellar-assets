{"name":"Education Assessment Cult","id":"education-assessment-cult","symbol":"eac","description":"The basic ecosystem protocol keeps META-Universe alive. It starts for the first time when a user comes in, and the user needs to sign up for a monthly or annual subscription to learn. This will be the basis for maintaining and developing the platform, and will integrate its components, i.e. master, user, creator, and cultural education into one, making it a connection through M-COIN, NFT, and PG. This will have a reward system that properly distributes profits between the masters and the company. It is a structured system that allows users to create or receive revenues based on goods turned into NFT by moving up to the creator level from the user level when they reach a certain level. This structure will develop into a self-sustaining M-Economy by the time set in the project.","links":"http://eacplatform.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/education-assessment-cult/logo.png"}
