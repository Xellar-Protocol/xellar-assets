{"name":"Wrestling Shiba","id":"wrestling-shiba","symbol":"wwe","description":"What are our goals and what drives us to achieve them? The Wrestling Shiba team looks towards creating the next blockbuster fighting game with esports competition in mind. Our aspirations towards building an AAA-level game are what first sets us apart from others in the NFT gaming industry. Such an undertaking used to be impossible for independent studios, but today with the fundraising capabilities of the crypto and NFTs this is a realistic and achievable goal. Paying homage to the old-school fighting games we all grew up with, Wrestling Shiba looks to take that inspiration and apply it to the industry-defining innovation possible with blockchain technology. Wrestling Shiba is focused on building a free-to-play competitive fighting game with PVP & eSports at the forefront of development and design decisions. Fight Legends is fight gaming, simply improved through blockchain technology as opposed to being the center of attention at the behest of gameplay thatâ€™s dynamic and fun.
