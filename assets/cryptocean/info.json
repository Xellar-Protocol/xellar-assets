CRYPTOCEAN is a blockchain based ecosystem that combines financial and technological services for working with crypto-currencies, digital financial assets, and traditional fiat money. You can purchase cryptocurrencies with your bank card/account, get your fiat inside the service and legally transfer it to a card or a bank account. You can also order from them a classic plastic card (crypto card), issued together with their partner banks. It will enable you to deposit and withdraw cash from your financial and crypto accounts in regular ATMs using CRYPTOCEAN services and also pay for purchases – goods and services – with cryptocurrency, as if you were paying with a usual bank card. All the processes of exchanging cryptocurrencies on exchanges, transferring funds from exchanges to your personal account, maintaining the limits you set, will be automatic. You can also pay for goods and services without a crypto card either via our mobile application using a mobile phone with an NFC chip or directly through an online store that has switched CRYPTOCEAN on as a payment system. They made a special crypto account service – a multi-currency crypto wallet for TOP-100 cryptocurrencies.
