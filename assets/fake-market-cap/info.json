{"name":"Fake Market Cap","id":"fake-market-cap","symbol":"cap","description":"Fake Market CAP ($CAP) is a conceptual artwork about the speculative crypto currency market and meme coins by Sterling Crispin. CAP has a fixed supply of 420,690,000 coins. Each time a coin transfers between a wallet or smart contract, the publicly reported total number of coins increases in an exponential fashion. Again, cap has a fixed supply but incorrectly reports an expanding supply. Because of this, the Fake Market Cap expands beyond BTC, ETH, the entire global economy, and the number of stars in the universe. To see the real market cap, refer to the Fully Diluted Value, which is Coin Price * 420,690,000 of the coins available. In an effort to avoid any confusion, this coin is called Fake Market Cap.","links":"https://fakemarketcap.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/fake-market-cap/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc6cd44f9630886a7492cea3d9860e0510933a600"}}}
