{"name":"Law Service Token","id":"law-service-token_ethereum","symbol":"lst","description":"Law Service Token (LST) is a utility token built on the Ethereum blockchain that powers a decentralized legal services platform. The platform enables users to submit legal requests directly on-chain using smart contracts, removing the need for intermediaries such as legal brokers or agencies. Verified legal professionals can respond to these requests through a reverse auction system, offering competitive pricing and transparent service terms. All interactions—requests, responses, agreements, and payments—are immutably recorded on the blockchain, ensuring accountability and data integrity. The system also includes a staking mechanism that rewards users for long-term participation, reinforcing ecosystem stability. In September 2025, the platform will launch a pilot program with licensed law firms handling real legal cases, followed by the official release of a mobile application in February 2026. By combining blockchain transparency, automated contracting, and global lawyer access, LST aims to create a fully Web3-native legal infrastructure.","links":"https://ls-token.com","market_cap":25001,"market_cap_rank":9353,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/law-service-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xa78cdb9a2e3ff8f24ef76e23a9fb858045d24d32","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xa78cdb9a2e3ff8f24ef76e23a9fb858045d24d32"}},"is_native":false}
