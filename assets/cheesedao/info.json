{"name":"CheeseDAO","id":"cheesedao","symbol":"cheez","description":"CheeseGame is a decentralized game of risk, owned entirely by its players. Inspired by the innovations of DeFi giants such as OlympusDAO and BarnBridge, CheeseGame employs NFT staking contracts, bonding mechanisms, and on-chain governance contracts to deliver an exciting novel GameFi experience. Players compete in teams (“Mazes”) to earn CheeseGame’s asset-backed $CHEEZ token as well as exclusive token emission prizes from partner projects like Feta Market. There are many possible strategies and numerous ways to win. Each NFT game piece (mouse, cat, trap, cow) has its own abilities and players select pieces based on their own individual risk tolerances and time preferences. The CheeseGame DAO is focused on expanding its GameFi products and incubating exciting new protocols from small tools like https://miladymumble.net/ to more ambitious undertakings like https://feta.market/.
