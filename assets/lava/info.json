{"name":"Lava","id":"lava","symbol":"lava","description":"Elysium is a fully Ethereum-compatible smart contract platform built using Polkadot, Substrate and frontier. Substrate is the primary blockchain SDK used by developers to create the parachains that make up the Polkadot network. Frontier is the suite that provides an Ethereum compatibility layer for Substrate and it also enables us to run Ethereum dapps natively on Substrate. Features: Substrate help us to achieve high throughput. Approx. 2500 to 3000 transactions per second. Substrate is flexible, futureproof, open source and upgradeable framework. It also support forkless upgrades which is very convenient for adding new features. It supports MetaMask, Remix IDE, Hardhat, Waffle, and Truffle that people already familiar with. Users can interact with Elysium via the Ethereum API (Web3js, EtherJS) and Substrate API (Polkadot JS). All existing Ethereum RPC methods work, so none of your dapps will break.","links":"https://elysiumchain.tech/","market_cap":7615655,"market_cap_rank":1581,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/lava/logo.png","detail_platform":{"":{"decimal_place":null,"contract_address":""}}}
