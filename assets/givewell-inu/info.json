{"name":"Givewell Inu","id":"givewell-inu","symbol":"ginu","description":"GiveWell is a nonprofit dedicated to finding outstanding giving opportunities and publishing the full details of our analysis to help donors decide where to give.We don't focus solely on financials, such as assessing administrative or fundraising costs. Instead, we conduct in-depth research to determine how much good a given program accomplishes (in terms of lives saved, lives improved, etc.) per dollar spent. GiveWell Inu ($GINU) was born as a reaction to Vitalik Buterin's latest tweet. We intend to establish our position into the Vitalik Buterin meta - following, and surpassing, the likes of $THE, $DIE, and $MASYA. However, $GINU intends to be more than just a hollow noun or word. $GINU is motivated to do good and to develop a strong philanthropic community. To this end, $GINU's first project is to donate all proceeds from 2% tax to @GiveWell, a non-profit close to Vitalik Buterin's heart (see his tweet). This non-profit is dedicated to finding outstanding giving opportunities and publishing the full details of the analysis to help donors decide where to give. GiveWell doesn't focus solely on financials, such as assessing administrative or fundraising costs. Instead, GiveWell conducts in-depth research to determine how much impact a given program accomplishes (in terms of lives saved, lives improved, etc.) per dollar spent.","links":"https://www.givewellinu.com/home","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/givewell-inu/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x74be64b45d394fa57816c1950e94dbb8d7a7b306"}}}
