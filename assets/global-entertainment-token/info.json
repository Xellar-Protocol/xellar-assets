The project links music, film, sports, gaming and live events with tokenised real-world assets such as tickets, merchandise and property. Its infrastructure—comprising GET Wallet, GET Pay and an NFT/RWA marketplace—enables transparent revenue distribution to creators, verifiable ownership for fans and a single payment rail that works in both virtual and physical venues. By combining utility and governance in one currency, GET provides the foundation for a participatory, data-transparent entertainment economy.","links":"https://global-entertainment-token.org/","market_cap":20783151,"market_cap_rank":1299,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/global-entertainment-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"cardano":{"decimal_place":4,"contract_address":"33be91b6ae36905945138fbd131ca0fc255dc55ab5c2bfbc8fb41072476c6f62616c20456e7465727461696e6d656e7420546f6b656e202847455429","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/cardano/tokens/33be91b6ae36905945138fbd131ca0fc255dc55ab5c2bfbc8fb41072476c6f62616c20456e7465727461696e6d656e7420546f6b656e202847455429"}}}
