{"name":"Catacomb","id":"catacomb","symbol":"cata","description":"CATA is the native token of Catacomb, running on TON (The Open Network). CATA isnâ€™t just a meme; we go beyond by leveraging Telegram's 1-billion-user network through a staking protocol accessible via our ever-evolving Telegram mini-app. The concept is simple: the longer you stake, the greater your rewards. The APY increases with each longer staking period you choose. Once your staking period concludes, you can claim your rewards.","links":"https://catacomb.fyi","market_cap":0,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/catacomb/logo.png","detail_platform":{"the-open-network":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"EQBh4XMahI9T81bj2DbAd97ZLQDoHM2rv2U5B59DVZkVN1pl"}}}
