{"name":"INFLIV","id":"infliv","symbol":"ifv","description":"INFLIV aim to provide a fast and secured trading experience to our customers in BTC, ETH, USDT and IFV trading options. Infliv prioritizes security of funds and user information by requiring users to enable 2FA using Google Authenticator, or a U2F Security Key. To protect security of funds, majority of system funds are stored in cold wallets and only approx. 0.5% of crypto assets are accessible in hot wallets for day-to-day platform operations. The Infliv Token (IFV) is built with ERC20 token based on Ethereum blockchain technology. This technology brings scalability and security to users, and will soon reach the market with the prospect of revolutionizing the definition of exchanges. Token holders will be granted exclusive benefits such as progressive discounts on the monthly subscription fees. This is in addition to the highest quality service and speed when approving user deposits and withdrawals. Infliv (IFV) supports all the Ethereum wallets.","links":"https://infliv.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/infliv/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x3656bd0f3f07623bb7f429b390d208f894e44ece"}}}
