The token supports and provides utility for a borderless, cross-chain crypto trading platform and portfolio manager for user self-sovereignty.

The ShapeShift DAO earns revenues, and the user earns FOX tokens which can represent entitlement to those revenues. The total capped supply of FOX is 1,000,001,337 tokens.","links":"https://shapeshift.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/shapeshift-fox-token/logo.png"}
