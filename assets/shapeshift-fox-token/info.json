The token supports and provides utility for a borderless, cross-chain crypto trading platform and portfolio manager for user self-sovereignty. As the ShapeShift ecosystem expands, users will be able to earn FOX tokens for activity that generates revenue for the DAO via affiliate partnerships (i.e. earning yield, buying/selling/trading crypto and nft's, buying swag or a y.at, etc.). The ShapeShift DAO earns revenues, and the user earns FOX tokens which can represent entitlement to those revenues. The total capped supply of FOX is 1,000,001,337 tokens.","links":"https://shapeshift.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/shapeshift-fox-token/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xc770eefad204b5180df6a14ee197d99d808ee52d"},"polygon-pos":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x65a05db8322701724c197af82c9cae41195b0aa8"},"xdai":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x21a42669643f45bc0e086b8fc2ed70c23d67509d"}}}
