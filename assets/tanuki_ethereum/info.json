{"name":"Tanuki","id":"tanuki_ethereum","symbol":"tanuki","description":"For over a thousand years, the Tanuki has been Japan’s most unpredictable spirit, a lucky charm, a shape-shifter, a sake-lover, and a walking contradiction. Known for turning leaves into gold, belly-slapping to summon storms, and tricking emperors out of their clothes, he was never feared, only followed. $TANUKI revives that spirit for the modern age. Loved and renowned by millions. A symbol of laughter and luck. IOUs. Giant balls. Disguises. Don’t look for logic — look for movement. Already a Legend.","links":"https://www.tanukicoin.io/","market_cap":23903,"market_cap_rank":9437,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/tanuki/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x0b2fa18342d38909e3e44d7103cf3f37b0a0403a","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x0b2fa18342d38909e3e44d7103cf3f37b0a0403a"}},"is_native":false}
