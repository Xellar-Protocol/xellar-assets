{"name":"Kek","id":"kek-5_ethereum","symbol":"kek","description":"Kek is more than just a meme — he is rooted in ancient mythology. In Egyptian legend, Kek was the primordial god of chaos and darkness, often shown with the head of a frog. He ruled the space between night and day, symbolizing transformation, rebirth, and unseen forces shaping reality. Centuries later, Kek was reborn on the internet as the God of Memes, a symbol of viral chaos, inside jokes, and “meme magic.” The frog became his face, and his power became the unpredictable energy that drives culture online. Today, Kek lives on as $KEK, a memecoin powered not only by speculation but also by belief, community, and the magic of memes.","links":"https://kek.vip/","market_cap":81001,"market_cap_rank":7387,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/kek-5_ethereum/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x7beb8f36650e9327d8c52735e3b3c9d1521576e3","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0x7beb8f36650e9327d8c52735e3b3c9d1521576e3"}},"is_native":false}
