{"name":"Bitburn","id":"bitburn","symbol":"burn","description":"Bitburn Token is an BEP-20 rewards token that pays 5% Binance-Peg BTCB token rewards to its holders. Rewards are automatically deployed to holders according to buy and sell volume. The formula is simple—the more Bitburn tokens you hold, the more Bitcoin rewards you will earn! Buyers and sellers of the Bitburn Token incur a 10% tax. The tax allocation is as follows: 5% Binance-Peg BTCB Token rewards paid to holders, 3% marketing, & 2% true burn. What is a true burn? A true burn means that the supply of Bitburn decreases with every buy and sell—we don’t just send the tokens to a burn address.","links":"https://bitburn.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/bitburn/logo.png"}
