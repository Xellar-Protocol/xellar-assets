{"name":"RUNNER","id":"runner","symbol":"runner","description":"Maestro, Unibot and Banana sniper bots are known to snipe within 6 to 15 seconds depending on blockchain traffic and server issues, while Runner Sniper Bot allows sniping within 2 seconds. Where other Sniper Bots have limited wallets to snipe with, we have no limitations. We will have multisell and bundling on block 0 implemented into our sniper bot very soon!","links":"https://runnersniper.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/runner/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x834e7fdc574cc0c95857da38190b453a3666387e"}}}
