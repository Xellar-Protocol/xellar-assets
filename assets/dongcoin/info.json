{"name":"DongCoin","id":"dongcoin","symbol":"dong","description":"What is the project about? DongCoin (똥코인) is Korea’s first s***coin (excluding Luna). Koreans love cryptocurrency, but up until now they have only had a small presence in early, on-chain-only coins (lovingly referred to as s***coins). DongCoin was created in order to give on-chain Koreans their own coin to enjoy. What makes your project unique? Korea's first s***coin (excluding Luna) What’s next for your project? No formal roadmap (we do have plans but would rather under-promise and over-deliver) History of your project. What can your token be used for? (Utility, NOT tokenomics) DongCoin was created in order to give on-chain Koreans their own coin to enjoy.","links":"https://xn--v71bo24apwf.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/dongcoin/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x4208aa4d7a9a10f4f8bb7f6400c1b2161d946969"}}}
