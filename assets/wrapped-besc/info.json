{"name":"BESC LLC","id":"wrapped-besc","symbol":"besc","description":"BESC LLC is a Solana-based cryptocurrency project that integrates real-world business revenue with blockchain technology. The project is centered around a utility token that provides holders with dividends from the profits of Builders Edge Services & Construction, a company specializing in residential and commercial construction services. Beyond revenue sharing, BESC LLC includes an in-house casino and a centralized exchange, expanding its ecosystem. The casino uses the token for gaming, and the exchange facilitates digital asset trading. This multifaceted approach offers diverse use cases for the token, enhancing its utility within the ecosystem. The project's integration with Builders Edge Services & Construction allows token holders to benefit from a non-crypto revenue stream, reducing the volatility typically associated with digital assets. The dividend structure distributes a portion of the company’s profits to token holders, incentivizing long-term participation. BESC LLC leverages Solana’s fast and low-cost transactions to create an efficient and scalable ecosystem that bridges blockchain assets with real-world business operations. The roadmap includes expanding the business-backed crypto model, integrating with more industries, and continually improving financial distribution mechanisms. This unique combination of traditional business backing and blockchain innovation offers a sustainable model for token utility and value creation.","links":"https://bescllc.com","market_cap":608631,"market_cap_rank":4261,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/wrapped-besc/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"DDE8MnEjYsukfiG2DCu4EeJM3wU4jngLci65mQyzYs7H","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/DDE8MnEjYsukfiG2DCu4EeJM3wU4jngLci65mQyzYs7H"}}}
