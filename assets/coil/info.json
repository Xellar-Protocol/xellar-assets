{"name":"Coil","id":"coil","symbol":"coil","description":"The coil token has a built in elevator system that helps the chart to reach higher lows every single day. Every day a new milestone at a certain price will be set which is going to act as a new support. If price is broken, contract disables sells immediately while price is below the floor. It means that if support is retested, selling will not go through until price is above support.","links":"https://coileth.io","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/coil/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x3130c55d6138809687a1bfbe0f0cc258df37b81e"}}}
