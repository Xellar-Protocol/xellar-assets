{"name":"Starknet","id":"starknet","symbol":"strk","description":"StarkNet is a permissionless decentralized Layer 2 (L2) validity rollup, built to allow Ethereum to scale via cryptographic protocols called STARKs, without compromising Ethereum’s core principles of decentralization, transparency, inclusivity and security. The StarkNet Token is needed to operate the ecosystem, maintain and secure it, decide on its values and strategic goals, and direct its evolution. This token will be required for (i) governance, (ii) payment of transaction fees on StarkNet, and (iii) participation in StarkNet’s consensus mechanism.","links":"https://starknet.io/","market_cap":673268551,"market_cap_rank":99,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/starknet/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xca14007eff0db1f8135f4c25b34de49ab0d42766"},"starknet":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x4718f5a0fc34cc1af16a1cdee98ffb20c31f5cd61d6ab07201858f4287c938d"}}}
