{"name":"The Real Tsygan","id":"the-real-tsygan","symbol":"tsygan","description":"On 22 July 1951, after six months of training, two small dogs nicknamed Tsygan and Dezik were launched from the site of the first Soviet cosmodrome in a region called Kapustin Yar. At a height of 110 km, the head of the rocket containing the dogs separated and began to free-fall back down to Earth. They experienced intense G-forces during descent, but after a heavy jolt from the parachute, the cabin containing the two four-legged pilots slowed and touched down safely. The trip, which lasted 15 minutes from start to finish, made Tsygan and Dezik the first animals to experience space flight and to emerge from the craft unharmed.","links":"https://www.tsygan.space/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/the-real-tsygan/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x744dc59f30ac1992b28564287970441441def136"}}}
