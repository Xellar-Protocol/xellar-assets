{"name":"Expand","id":"xzk_ethereum","symbol":"xzk","description":"Expand: Trustless Authentication Layer for AI Agents. Empowering AI with secure & verifiable data access using Zero-Knowledge Proofs. As AI Agents push the boundaries of their applications, ensuring secure and private data access remains a critical bottleneck for intelligence and large-scale adoption. To address this challenge, Expand is introducing the Trustless Authentication Layer for AI Agents—a secure, efficient, and trustless authorization framework. By integrating Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK-Proofs), Expand enables zk Agents to securely retrieve and verify necessary information in a trustless environment, enhancing their decision-making and expanding their applicability. This breakthrough allows AI Agents to securely access a broader range of high-value data sources while maintaining privacy and security.","links":"https://expandzk.com/","market_cap":231470,"market_cap_rank":5681,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/xzk/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xe8fc52b1bb3a40fd8889c0f8f75879676310ddf0","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/tokens/0xe8fc52b1bb3a40fd8889c0f8f75879676310ddf0"}},"is_native":false}
