{"name":"YETI","id":"yeti-2","symbol":"yeti","description":"YETI is a Solana-based meme token and cultural experiment focused on decentralized community engagement, content creation, and social commentary within the crypto space. It was launched in May 2025 with no presale, no VC backing, and a renounced contract, ensuring a fair and transparent token distribution. The project is designed around a decentralized model where community members drive visibility and growth through daily meme campaigns, Telegram-based raiding efforts, and influencer collaborations. Rather than focusing on technical utility or DeFi functions, YETI leverages meme culture and humor to foster engagement, amplify messages, and challenge conventional narratives within the Solana ecosystem. YETI is traded on decentralized exchanges like Raydium and has gained early momentum through high-volume social media reach and organized online campaigns. All development and promotion efforts are community-led, and the project has no roadmap or centralized leadership, aligning with its core principle of authentic, ground-up crypto culture.","links":"https://yetidegen.com/","market_cap":20968217,"market_cap_rank":1110,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/yeti-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"FuyeX8cpctBwQVDFYgKxYh1JgiXCkK9g4RBVCXm4pump"}}}
