{"name":"Mi-Young","id":"mi-young_solana","symbol":"miyo","description":"The darkest cat on the Bonk ecosystem, $Miyo stands out not just by its striking appearance but by the rich cultural layers woven into its identity. The name Mi-Young, meaning \"Eternal Beauty\" in Korean, perfectly encapsulates the essence of this memecoin — a symbol of timeless allure, mystery, and depth in a space often dominated by flash and hype. Unlike many meme projects that focus solely on surface-level gimmicks, $Miyo embraces a more nuanced approach, drawing inspiration from pop culture, visual aesthetics, behavioral perception, and cultural symbolism. Each element of the project has been thoughtfully crafted to resonate with those who appreciate the subtleties behind a symbol and the stories that define a community. Visually, $Miyo presents itself as a black cat with mesmerizing green eyes — a figure steeped in mystery and magic. In many cultures, black cats have been seen as both omens of luck and symbols of the unknown, walking the fine line between superstition and charm. $Miyo takes this duality and transforms it into a celebration of the misunderstood and the unique, appealing to those who see value beyond the obvious.","links":"https://www.miyoungcat.com/","market_cap":3307.22,"market_cap_rank":12840,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mi-young/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"83XaBnHkt3MFbGiqx7y1VpAYGTqCQon6i3isVPmQbonk","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/83XaBnHkt3MFbGiqx7y1VpAYGTqCQon6i3isVPmQbonk"}},"is_native":false}
