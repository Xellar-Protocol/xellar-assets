{"name":"LedgerLand","id":"ledgerland","symbol":"lger","description":"What is the project about? Ledgerland seeks to address the shortcomings of traditional centralized social media and financial platforms by leveraging the benefits of blockchain technology and decentralized governance. By distributing power among users and enabling peer-to-peer interactions, Ledgerland empowers users to freely express their ideas, transact without intermediaries, and participate in policy-making processes. What makes your project unique? A nation on Bitcoin History of your project. The foundation of Ledgerland started with a dedicated team of volunteers who embraced the ethos of a digital nation that puts its citizens first. During this phase, we focused on creating a comprehensive design for Ledgerland's unique tokenomics and drafting a constitution that embodies our vision of free speech, financial fairness, and independence. Simultaneously, we actively fostered a community of early adopters, enthusiasts, and visionaries who shared our ambitious goals. Whatâ€™s next for your project? In terms of product development, the public mint of $LGER, our native utility token, is set to kick off in early July. Following the token launch, the introduction of Ledgerland Passport is slated for the middle of July. Furthermore, we are eager to launch TownHall, our decentralized social network, in early August. What can your token be used for? The $LGER token is not just the digital currency of Ledgerland; it is the lifeblood pumping through the veins of our digital nation.","links":"https://ledgerland.org/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/ledgerland/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ordinals":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"e40d4c06b7cd48e6bbcdcb3f1946aececa19f1ee9e08ed02eb94779cb457ede5i0"}}}
