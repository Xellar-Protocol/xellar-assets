{"name":"Lint","id":"lint","symbol":"lint","description":"What is the project about? Lint is a revolutionary cryptocurrency that challenges the conventional wisdom of memecoins, which traditionally launch with a supply in the trillions. In contrast, Lint is launching with a singular token, divided into nine decimal places. This paradigm shift embodies a novel concept in the crypto world, one that asserts that the supply and the price of each “coin” are inherently meaningless. Instead, what truly matters is owning a percentage of the liquidity supply and understanding its mechanisms of increase. What makes your project unique? The Power of Liquidity Owning a percentage of a cryptocurrency’s liquidity supply, on the other hand, is akin to owning a piece of the infrastructure that enables the exchange of that currency. It means you are part of the network that facilitates transactions and, in the process, helps to stabilize and grow the currency’s ecosystem. In Lint’s case, the potential for growth lies not in the multiplication of tokens, but in the expansion of liquidity and the consequent network effect. In other words, the single Lint token isn’t just a standalone unit of value, it’s a gateway to a larger, more connected, and fluid financial ecosystem. History of your project. WE just launched on May 15th 2023 What’s next for your project? Roadmap and Whitpaper release What can your token be used for? Despite having only one token, Lint’s divisibility to eighteen decimal places ensures that it is just as distributable as any other cryptocurrency. This extreme divisibility allows for broad accessibility and inclusivity, even with a singular token.","links":"http://www.lint.fyi","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/lint/logo.png","detail_platform":{"ethereum":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"0x11f9e9b3c539368bea16dde2108b748a9672d714"}}}
