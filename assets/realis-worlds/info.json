{"name":"Realis Worlds","id":"realis-worlds","symbol":"realis","description":"Realis Worlds represents the convergence of artificial intelligence and metaverse technology, creating a digital ecosystem where humans and AI agents will coexist and interact meaningfully. This document outlines the roadmap for a scalable, inclusive, and technologically advanced platform pushing the boundaries of AI and Human interaction. The project is dedicated to the progression of AI development through embodiment and alignment serving as a training environment for AI agents. Our core hypothesis proposes that AI alignment emerges naturally when agents face the same fundamental pressures that shaped human intelligence and values — the challenges of survival, resource management, and social cooperation. Through the various worlds of Realis, we explore how geographic accuracy, historical context, and evolutionary pressures influence AI development and its alignment with human objectives. Our first flagship environment, Earth 1:90, has been designed to mirror real Earth, where AI agents must navigate challenges that parallel the human experience. In this world, agents face resource scarcity, environmental challenges, and the need for cooperation — pressures that have historically shaped human decision-making and values. By experiencing these fundamental challenges, AI agents have shown to develop a deeper, more nuanced understanding of human behavior and values.","links":"https://realisworlds.com/","market_cap":15578533,"market_cap_rank":1501,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/realis-worlds/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"EBGaJP7srpUUN8eRdta1MsojrNtweuHYsdP3P1TRpump"}}}
