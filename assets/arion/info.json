{"name":"Arion","id":"arion","symbol":"arion","description":"ARION Coin is a community created Coin. Open Source, peer to peer, decentralised, InstantSend transactions, PrivateSend, Masternodes. Our current members are from the original community of Mutual Coin. At the beginning of January, after having done very well on www.coinsmarkets.com, Mutual Coinâ€™s Developer and Main Staking Pool Manager left the community without a trace. The community was left in chaos. To make matters worse the only exchange it was listed on crashed and went offline. This left a massive amount of Mutual Coins on the exchange, which to date, are un-accessible and unable to trade.","links":"https://arioncoin.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/arion/logo.png"}
