{"name":"Vires Finance","id":"vires-finance","symbol":"vires","description":"Vires.finance is a decentralised non-custodial liquidity protocol based on Waves blockchain, where users, wallets and dapps can participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to take a loan in an overcollateralized manner. Vires.finance utilises common pool-based mechanics where all the funds deposited participate in interest-bearing activities equally. The greater the demand for borrowing an asset is, the greater APY lenders get in return. Users can lend and borrow the following tokens: WAVES, USDN, USDT, ETH, USDC, EURN and BTC.","links":"https://vires.finance/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/vires-finance/logo.png","detail_platform":{"waves":{"decimal_place":8,"contract_address":"DSbbhLsSTeDg5Lsiufk2Aneh3DjVqJuPr2M9uU1gwy5p"}}}
