{"name":"HealthChainUS","id":"healthchainus","symbol":"hcut","description":"How does HealthChainUs work? The process begins with a patient who is a data producer, storing his or her medical records in the patient’s personal repository provided by the health care provider, and storing them on his own. The patient then goes through a simple procedure of consent for the third party to use his or her data. Alternatively, the data consumer may request direct use by a member of the Health Organization (patient) and receive acceptance to utilize the patient’s data. Data consumers can use a variety of services (statistics, surveys, advertising, etc.) within the health care system without having to download data and deliver results.And the data that is licensed to be utilized can be accessed and utilized again within the authorized time frame at any time. As such, the proceeds from data consumption are fairly distributed to the data production, delivery, retention, and administrator, enabling data sovereignty to be realized in real life.","links":"https://healthchainus.com/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/healthchainus/logo.png"}
