{"name":"Mascot of the Trenches","id":"mascot-of-the-trenches_solana","symbol":"rug","description":"$RUG – The Mascot of the Trenches 🟧🫵 In the brutal Solana memecoin trenches where rugs happen every minute, $RUG flips the script: why get rugged when you can hold the rug? All creator rewards are used for buybacks into the coin. The goal is to accumulate 20% of the supply overtime and lock it all to a $1 Billion market cap using Streamflow's price-lock feature. NO TIMED LOCKS, that 20% only unlocks when we hit that market cap. Once that price is reached, WE BURN IT ALL. The ultimate irony play, $RUG is the battle-hardened mascot for every degen who’s survived dips, jeets, and paper-hand carnage. $RUG isn’t just a token — it’s the symbol of the trenches. Anti-rug in spirit, the Reverse Rug Meta.","links":"https://rugrugrug.me/","market_cap":83138,"market_cap_rank":7315,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/mascot-of-the-trenches_solana/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"Gtas1jTXjD4EpYqDFKk7cEaArFSdaUXKu6bGhbSvpump","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/Gtas1jTXjD4EpYqDFKk7cEaArFSdaUXKu6bGhbSvpump"}},"is_native":false}
