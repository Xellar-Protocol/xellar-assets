{"name":"StaFi Staked SOL","id":"stafi-staked-sol_solana","symbol":"rsol","description":"What is the project about? rSOL, a decentralized DeFi product produced by StaFi that solves the liquidity problem of staked SOL on Solana mainnet. rSOL token is a synthetic staking derivative issued by StaFi when users stake SOL through the StaFi rSOL App. rSOL tokens are anchored to the staked SOL assets and the corresponding staking rewards. rSOL tokens can be transferred and traded at any time. What makes your project unique? rSOL App can help SOL stakers solve two major issues: - There will be no need to wait for a 3 days cooldown period to withdraw the staked SOL assets. rSOL App users can transfer and trade rSOL assets at any time to liberate liquidity and hedge price risks. - There is no need to learn the complicated Tower BFT consensus mechanism or staking reward calculation rules if you want to maximize staking rewards. With rSOL App, users only need to follow a few steps to deposit SOL into the rSOL contract, which will automatically select the best validator to delegate by the profit maximization strategy. History of your project. StaFi has launched rETH, rMATIC, rSOL, rATOM, rBNB, and other tokens to solve the liquidity problem. What’s next for your project? What can your token be used for? rSOL can be swapped for FIS and other rToken in a DEX.","links":"https://www.stafi.io/","market_cap":null,"market_cap_rank":null,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/stafi-staked-sol/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"7hUdUTkJLwdcmt3jSEeqx4ep91sm1XwBxMDaJae6bD5D","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/7hUdUTkJLwdcmt3jSEeqx4ep91sm1XwBxMDaJae6bD5D"}},"is_native":false}
