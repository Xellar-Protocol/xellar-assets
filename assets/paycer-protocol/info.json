{"name":"Paycer Protocol","id":"paycer-protocol","symbol":"pcr","description":"Paycer is developing a bridge protocol that aggregates DeFi and crypto services cross-chain and combines them with TradFi to create new user-friendly financial products and services available on an easy to use platform. The Paycer Protocol will provide cross chain operability and aggregate certain DeFi products from different blockchains. The Paycer Platform will combine the Paycer Protocol with traditional financial services like a bank account and a debit card. Users only need to make a fiat money deposit on the Paycer platform to get started, no interaction with cryptocurrencies or DeFi is required. Paycer will then automatically place the deposit in selected DeFi products, providing a high and constant interest rate as a passive income.","links":"https://www.paycer.io/","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/paycer-protocol/logo.png"}
