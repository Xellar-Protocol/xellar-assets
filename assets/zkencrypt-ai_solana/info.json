{"name":"ZKEncrypt AI","id":"zkencrypt-ai_solana","symbol":"zke","description":"ZKEncrypt AI is a decentralized application (DApp) platform engineered to serve as a high-fidelity reference implementation for privacy-preserving AI computation on the Solana blockchain. This project provides the definitive architecture for integrating advanced, confidential compute paradigms within a high-throughput Web3 ecosystem. The platform's core thesis is that the future of on-chain AI necessitates absolute data confidentiality. ZKEncrypt AI achieves this by implementing a robust Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) infrastructure. This enables AI agents to perform complex computations—such as inference or data analysis—directly on user-supplied ciphertext. At no point in the compute lifecycle is the underlying plaintext data exposed to the AI model, node operators, or any network-level observers.","links":"https://zk-labs.network/","market_cap":7328.04,"market_cap_rank":11758,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/zkencrypt-ai/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":6,"contract_address":"4K3aMpVPggTWAw1jyN5cZJf3kpWjnfTYmxkVbMymhuwj","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/4K3aMpVPggTWAw1jyN5cZJf3kpWjnfTYmxkVbMymhuwj"}},"is_native":false}
