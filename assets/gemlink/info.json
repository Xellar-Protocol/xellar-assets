{"name":"GemLink","id":"gemlink","symbol":"glink","description":"Gemlink stands for anonymity of transactions. Other currencies have chosen to be little more than fiat imitations. We believe in the key privacy principle of cryptocurrency, and always will. Based on the Zcash, zk-SNARK protocol, Gemlink can either be mined by GPU miners or can provide passive income through investment in Gemlink masternodes. Holders of Gemlink masternodes are also able to contribute to the direction of Gemlink through voting rights as a quasi-DAO. Currently creating their own multi-token gateway as well as bridges to other ecosystems, including the Solana and Binance Smart Chain blockchains, allowing direct exchanges from the native Gemlink token to the relevant tokens. Gemlink is also working on a multi asset wallet and one click masternode setup.
