{"name":"AXEL.win","id":"axel-win","symbol":"axel","description":"The AXEL Lending Platform is a decentralized finance (DeFi) project operating on PulseChain, a low-fee blockchain fork of Ethereum launched in 2021. The platform centers around the axel.win token, which facilitates a lending and borrowing ecosystem. It features a token launchpad that enables new projects to introduce their tokens and a lending platform where users can create customizable vaults. These vaults allow lenders to set terms such as loan duration (1-365 days) and accepted collaterals, while borrowers can access funds instantly with pre-funded liquidity. The project aims to enhance financial accessibility within the PulseChain ecosystem, supporting a variety of tokens including NOPE, AXIS, and FIRE. By leveraging smart contracts, AXEL eliminates intermediaries, aligning with DeFi’s core principles of transparency and user control. The platform fosters a community-driven approach, encouraging participation from token holders and developers alike.","links":"https://axel.win/","market_cap":279176,"market_cap_rank":5947,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/axel-win/logo.png","detail_platform":{"pulsechain":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0xdd67d6523529294b50a1765769080034b6146ee7","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/pulsechain/tokens/0xdd67d6523529294b50a1765769080034b6146ee7"}}}
