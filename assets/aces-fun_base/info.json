We are bringing real-world, multi-billion-dollar assets on-chain, creating a liquid, transparent marketplace where collectors, sellers, and traders can all participate. Our platform merges direct RWA (real-world asset) listings with derivative markets, unlocking new opportunities for price discovery, liquidity, and participation at every level. To launch this vision, we are focusing on an ecosystem at the intersection of hyper-luxury, fine art, and iconic collectibles—an arena where tokenization creates powerful alignment between three key groups: Sellers, Buyers, and Retail participants.","links":"https://aces.fun/","market_cap":193577,"market_cap_rank":5961,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/aces-fun/logo.png","detail_platform":{"base":{"decimal_place":18,"contract_address":"0x55337650856299363c496065c836b9c6e9de0367","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/tokens/0x55337650856299363c496065c836b9c6e9de0367"}},"is_native":false}
