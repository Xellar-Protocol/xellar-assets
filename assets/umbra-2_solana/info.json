{"name":"Umbra","id":"umbra-2_solana","symbol":"u1","description":"Umbrae is a Multi-Chain Trading Infrastructure Layer developed by Ignis AI Labs. We are solving the fragmentation of DeFi by building a unified “DeFi-CeFi Hybrid” ecosystem. Our platform bridges the gap between the transparency of decentralized finance and the capability of centralized institutions. While our core trading rails remain permissionless, we overlay a proprietary compute layer to offer features—such as AI-driven automation and institutional liquidity management—that pure DeFi cannot support. This hybrid model allows us to service everyone from the retail novice to the compliance-focused whale.","links":"https://www.umbrae.io/","market_cap":3128281,"market_cap_rank":2493,"logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xellar-Protocol/xellar-assets/master/assets/umbra-2/logo.png","detail_platform":{"solana":{"decimal_place":9,"contract_address":"kedoobK2qe2f1V8ee5vDXFr3H7gKnhQVNJXA3Ltcyai","geckoterminal_url":"https://www.geckoterminal.com/solana/tokens/kedoobK2qe2f1V8ee5vDXFr3H7gKnhQVNJXA3Ltcyai"}},"is_native":false}
